TopGear When can they try the koenigsegg agera r or koenigsegg agera one:1?
TopGear Omg its funny that he said its a bedroom poster car because I have a poster of this car in my room
TopGear I would pick the maclaren p1 over the sesto elemento
TopGear Engine sounds awesome! good job Lambo, gotta change the name lol!
TopGear lucky son of a bitch!
TopGear The wall poster thing is funny because I have a sesto elemento poster and no pagoni one
TopGear The real pity is that instead of Hammond sounding like an awestruck butch little girl reviewing such a car, the job should have gone to Chris Monkey Harris a man who knows more than a little about driving supercars and could better describe the performance of such a machine.
TopGear Oh my god! You guys actually uploaded a video I had asked for!! Thank you so much guys! Thank you thank you thank you!!! But you should have kept the original music in it. The Ginormous track at 4:29 in the original BBC version is so much more fitting than this production music. Why did you replace the music? Just why? But still anyway, thank you for uploading the video and fulfilling my wish!
TopGear 4:00 Most hilarious moment of the season, followed by the one that tops it!
TopGear Its moving!...im moving!...its a boat!
TopGear Happy b day Clarkson!
TopGear The Battle of Britain theme playing as Jeremy was motoring along in his truckboat had me rolling!
TopGear I believe we deserve to see a remake of this challenge.  Have a nice day guys.
TopGear this video is VERY VERY old why did there reupload it anyway?
TopGear I need more wind! loool
TopGear I assume that most ladas broke because the lack of maintenance and people that bought it assumed since its cheap, it wont require any maintenance at all.They are so simple to work on and maintain but i guess that brits are lazy.
TopGear YES! THIS is what the future needs! The old models look with the modern technology! Thank you SingerI hope they will do it with the Lamborghini Diablo or the Ferrari F40!
TopGear Love the old one so much better
TopGear So much warmth and magenta in the driving part of the video
TopGear Too bad this cost 350k
TopGear German precision with American passion  Simply amazing!
TopGear Wow ! Who ever owns one of these singer 911s made the best use of 350,000. Lucky owners.
TopGear This makes me feel better about mankind in the modern age.
TopGear Turn10Studios We want this in Forza 5
TopGear Why on earth does Top Gear place so much emphasise on how quick a car can gofrom 0  60mph, and how well it can corner at high speed. Most of the cars testedlike this Porsche are priced beyond the means of your everyday person. At the endof the day, a car is a carriage. A means of transporting a person or persons frompoint A to point B. Lets get back to basics, a car doesnt have to cost the earth,and fly like a rocket. At least not in the real world.
TopGear Now to bring in the Stigs Japanese cousin this season...
TopGear So.some said that the stig cannot drift
TopGear i love how the car is constantly beeping, trying to tell the drifter to shift hahaha even the car starts freaking out xD

TopGear can anyone tell me what music this is?
TopGear So when does vtec kick in yo?
TopGear Totally agree the mowing deck should work to be called a lawn mower
TopGear Ok. Now take that tech and put it in a small 1 seater comuter car.
TopGear Can I mow my lawn while going the top speed of 130 mph
TopGear HONDA  Y U NO VTEC MOWER?
TopGear 1:16 at the point I would have start to shat myself!
TopGear Ive been waiting to see this thing in action, thanks for the video!
TopGear This is totally insane!
TopGear Casually commentates in Jeremy Clarksons voice. xDQuick question, DoctaM3, is that the Sony ActionCam? If so, would you suggest using an external mic to record sound or is it pointless? Im hoping to record a few laps of a 1988 Audi Quattro going round Cadwell Park in May.Thanks in advance. :)
TopGear That car is amazing .. great video as always !!
TopGear 1:10 with a passenger. pretty quick car
TopGear Ciao appena puoi puoi trovare un modo per fare i video come prima? A me non funziona al telefono... comunque sei un mito continua cos!
TopGear HoverVan Havoc  Top Gear  Series 20  BBC
TopGear Do you want to go over backwards i dont wanna go over at all lmao
TopGear This is why top gear uk is better.
TopGear You pillock, youve blown the engine...  Echoes of when Jeremy test drove the XJ220... Jaguar say this car can go up to 89mph in first gear...lets see if it can do 90 odd... Well the result was the same apparently...!
TopGear Want to get itunes, amazon gift cards and paypal cash?use tiny. ccpdown tiny. ccfcash
TopGear I always think of them as 3 friends who just got crazy ideas while beeing drunk..
TopGear Shitty American CEOs and product planners are what happened to Saab
TopGear No topgear anymore for now? :( When will season 21 resume?!?!?!Or when will season 22 start?!!?! I really hate this season obly had 7 episodes...
TopGear So how the hell do you see the whole video?
TopGear Overpriced piece of shit. dont waste your money.
TopGear It cost as much as a lambo but the numbers are just not there
TopGear Lack of cup holders. Do not want.
TopGear Under the hood of my girlfriend: 300pound pieceomeat dere you go!
TopGear under the hood not 1 pic of under the cars hood...
TopGear still look so beautiful...Roadsters are the best!!
TopGear Can you make a review of the Ford F150 Raptor?
TopGear Only idiots take part, yet hes taking part too, lol.
TopGear The Murcielago is definetely the best sounding Lambo ever made
TopGear Judging by the acceleration figures , Aventador might be the better choice in this bull run. Plus it is named after a real BULL!!!
TopGear Can anyone tell what the music was at the first scene of the Murcielago?
TopGear Yea he got one of that car last night in his dream
TopGear 1st generation Murcielago 3 Best supercar ever made!
TopGear this is YouTube GOLD!
TopGear Ragazzi scusate ma in che data sono stati a Roma?
TopGear How many cousins stig has?
TopGear wearing headphone over helmet..now i see a true genius. haha..
TopGear Sluchtka beats mixr :D
TopGear this game is the only way people can beat the stig
TopGear Some say ... That when not driving he is getting all the bitches.
TopGear Lets go bowling cousin
TopGear The games... meh, just another clone really. But this this add is 100x better.
TopGear ho finito ora di vedere tutte le stagioni che hai messo sul tuo canale. tutte fantastiche continua cos!!!!!
TopGear And yet its competitions are trying to perfect theirs .. Like BMW ans Audi
TopGear But now my electric bill will skyrocket...
TopGear Science will find the answer. Supercapacitor batteries are already being made and it wont take long before its perfected. These cars wont have any trouble at all going long distances on pure electricity
TopGear too late Tesla Roadster is the 1st battery powered super car.
TopGear ILL take the V8 anytime, I dont think electric Cars are gonna be perfect, at least not for now, and they are also too Expensive.
TopGear lol the electric Mercedes sls dosent make a sound
TopGear Gimmy the petrol sls anyday.
TopGear H E M P ! renewable, higher octane and would suffice the fake manmade global (uneducated) warming nuts. Electric cars destroy the environment through mining  disposal of neededused battery products. Nothing will replace internal combustion power, only stupidity.
TopGear Approaching ... approaching .. APPROACHING  !!!!!
TopGear bravo ragazzo continua cos :P
TopGear Quando pubblichi la seconda parte?
TopGear epico  seconda parte gg )
TopGear Stig just stands there like, I dont care.
TopGear Anyone knows the name of the music?
TopGear Wait, Not for 1 second in this video did we see under the hood... I wanted to see Under the hood
TopGear Isnt the engine just 2 ford 3.0 v6s stuck together?
TopGear One day.... One day....
TopGear this video was such a waste of time to watch...
TopGear Sei un grande!!! Ti ringrazio
TopGear I love that little lotus. Why dont more manufacturers take out all the heavy electronics on luxuries or do it for a particular lightweight model of the regular model? Imagine how much faster the 86 triplets would be if they made a light version where they took out the AC, leather seats, power windows, rear seats etc. That thing might be as quick as this lotus.
TopGear Even when I was playing need for speed most wanted I never had to hit the breaks when using the lotus even at max speed.
TopGear The point is: power and big engine doesnt mean everything .
TopGear Lets see it vs the shelby lets see who wins
TopGear As Clarkson has said many times, American cars are rubbish. They are only good for going fast in a straight line and nothing on them fits the way it should. My BMW and I agree with him.
TopGear The mustang is way heavier, thats why the lotus beat him..
TopGear A shelby gt500 will smoke the loutus
TopGear I own a 2013 Caterham Seven280 and a 2012 Lotus Exige S. I am two metres tall weighing under 130lbs. LotusCaterham have been my favourite cars since I first drove one stunning Lotus Evora 22 when I was sixteen. Now that I am almost nineteen and ridiculously barmy, I can say in simple terms, Lotus is love. Lotus is life. Seriously, there are no such cars that can make me smile more than track day cars. Yes, I love superlight cars, but I diversified my interests beyond that. I also love the microcars like the PEEL P50 and crazy cars like the Dutch Carver One. Any kind of car that looks absolutely insane is my kind of car. I only wish I bought that bloody Evora when I had the chance...Answer to Sushi vs Burger?Fish and Chips
TopGear Lol all those defending a crappy Mustang. Id take the Lotus in a second, yes its got few creature comforts blah blah. Use some shopping trolley ie. Golf for sensible stuff.
TopGear Worst sound track for a car commercial .. yet.
TopGear Grande... Continua cosi...
TopGear need more gears!! awesome!
TopGear Wow!!quando carichi le prossime?
TopGear Fast and furios real life :))))
TopGear What happened to James? His face is soo round! Lol
TopGear Am I the only one who thinks its strange to hear the wonderful Lamborghini V10 noise coming from an Audi? Its awesome that they offered it with the R8, but it doesnt seem to match the character of the car for some reason. I think I prefer the awesome Audi V8 soundtrack to accompany the gorgeous looks.
TopGear They are still using the wheel in the other side, D
TopGear Ferrari 458 Italia is my favourite car. :DDD
TopGear Definitely one of my all time favorite Top Gear segments
TopGear Circuito de Sir Francis Drake good one!

TopGear Something strange about them ,, what the reason of dressing up like that ..? Not good clothes
TopGear I would like to see P1 vs 918 :)
TopGear Such an awesome show!I mean honestly and genuinely I cannot think of anything else that is as good as Top Gear.Thank you guys for making an amazing show and being humorous and sincere.
TopGear And Iv just noticed that 2 of the 7 episodes are the Christmas speacial.Its probably not a bad thing we only get 5 episodes with how bad things have got.
TopGear Grazie mille da un fan di questa fantastica serie :)

TopGear This should have been titled, Is Aaron Pauls Breaking, Bad?
TopGear KOENIGSEGGIGNIGSEGGGIGSEGGGG

TopGear Ill be Lufthansa: Sorry ze gate is closed. xD
TopGear Ferrari is amazing! I need more of this kind of video!
TopGear Supercar Runway Race  Top Gear  Series 20  BBC: http:youtu.beDgjDMVRX0
TopGear Thank the Spanish government for this circuit.
TopGear its like a toy cars in the thumbnail
TopGear I live in America. Im only 11 but I absolutely love cars! I record every one of your episodes on BBC which is way better than the American Top Gear. You guys are just naturally funny! Just letting you know that you guys make me go to bed with a smile on my face.
TopGear There was actully damage done to the cars they show you if you watch full episode
TopGear If I had asked Top gear for a personal , specific video to be created for me ..it would be pretty much be THIS one as it is !Perverted Supercar Porn !
TopGear It was so much more exciting being there
TopGear Customize your message
TopGear I just buy geoff on the game !
TopGear I wanna race the stig!
TopGear We all know how awesome BBC is when its made available for Windows Phone.
TopGear on windows phone  think you..
TopGear Season 21 has only been about hot hatches.
TopGear wow, i wonder whos his girlfriend?
TopGear Top Gear Philippines, magupload naman kayo ng videos na may HD version. Halos wala tuloy silbi yung mga HD cameras na ginagamit niyo.
TopGear TopGear Jeremy Clarkson Work Harder Get a Car: http:youtu.beMLr9vWGe8mM
TopGear Ill get the Juan car instead which i can afford thank you
TopGear Is.... That should be in a rewind episode later this year.
TopGear i dont think need for speed will be like the fast and furious franchise since it isnt as realistic. If you check the trailer youll notice the koenigsegg on fire.....which looks really like fake fire around the car. Now it might be possible for many other need for speed(s) since every year EA releases a new one.
TopGear Oscars for FLD in ALL OF THE CATEGORIES
TopGear Id still take the 911 Turbo over the nismo GTR
TopGear Please toyota built the next supra. I am sick and tired of the 13 year old fanboys of the gtr. Oh the gtr can do this and the.gtr can do that. Only true skylines are the r32, r33 and r34. The.worst thing about these idiots is calling people who buy 911 turbos, lambos, ferraris, keonigseggs, paganis, ascaris and other very expensive cars dumb or other childish names, big deal the gtr can do 0 to sixty in 2.who gives a shit. You are comparing a gshock to a fine time piece. In the real world there are more important things like excitement and sense of occasion. The gtr give me niether. Its a plasticky, numb uninvolving driving experience. So please build the supra so the gtr fan guys can stop pissing upwind.
TopGear Why is the commenter of the week title image a silhouette of a cow???
TopGear and i dont like this episode...D
TopGear Yes I think need for speed will turn into a ff type of franchise because I have a feeling that it will have that eee........ kind of ending just like the first ff had and I think NFS will be a strong contend for a best movie of the year in my
TopGear I owe that man a beer.
TopGear I had a 92 same color I bought for 550 drove it 2 yrs and sold it for 800.... I like Volvos but the 1992 was the worst 850 !the 97 I drive now I bought for 600 and been driving it for 6 yrs now with 230k on the clock still going strong.....let some one else eat the new car cost and drive it for years on the cheap !
TopGear This is a car you really wanted to see what time it would get.. And its wet... Do it again? :)
TopGear anyone else notice the stig had blonde hair leaking out of his helmet?
TopGear Whats a Caterham thats sort of balanced between the two ?
TopGear I dont care what I look like, I would drive one to the pub.
TopGear Please check out my car video of the new Caterham AeroSeven concept: http:youtu.bedXqniLdKBkE
TopGear 1:39 It can barely put its power down!
TopGear Seems like it should be fast in the dry. They should have sacrificed a little power Im favor of the muffler to make it sound like it looks. Its not a bloody rally car
TopGear I Love captain Slow but he is a bit too stiff about motoring!give him a straightaway and he will troll it, even with 900 horspower!
TopGear A45 AMG, Launch Control?
TopGear The most pointless thing ever since James Mays Ferrari.
TopGear This is what happens when robot Stig farts during a test drive.
TopGear Next time set the stig on fire too
TopGear This is coming to barbados literally a week after I leave I wish I knew Im here now
TopGear why does it have to be that suburu, why not the new ones.
TopGear can we just have a making of special already...like a direct to DVD thing?
TopGear QWERTYUIOPASDFFGHJKLZXCVBNM
TopGear You need to put top gear live on DVD or have it in a cinema in 3D.the fans would go and view this.IF YOU MAKE IT THEY WILL COME.
TopGear Top Gear is turning into Monty Python. I dont see what all the fuss is about, or you have to be British to understand it?
TopGear almost every show seems to have wet conditions. Does it rain that much in the UK?!
TopGear i know it was wet last time u came  hahahh is she serious with that question ?
TopGear Thank god there havent been any Top Gear USA episodes....inbefore TG USA episodes...
TopGear As exciting as this lap was you Top Gear NEEDS to give it a fair dry lap. How can they accept that lap when its almost 5 seconds slower than the r500?! Not cool. I want to see if caterham can still shame the big dogs for a fraction of the price
TopGear 1:20 Literally got left in the dust...Wow.
TopGear american voice sucks ,  it s like to hear a duck speaking ... the english voice is more soft but not better than a latin voice really soft . i prefer to watch top gear in french than the american voice of top gear .  the english brit top gear voice is better but not so good than you say it .
TopGear nothing better than english and omg spanish hahahhaa
TopGear English top gear and english accent language beats all!
TopGear Sound like Spain peoples no Mexicans
TopGear Worlds most watched factual show... ahem... factual... Top Gear is my favourite TV show of all time and its definitely the most entertaining, but I wouldnt call it factual LMAO.

TopGear AHAHAHA Hammond sounds so weird speaking in Spanish !
TopGear Jeremy has a certain way of describing things that is unlike any other host.

TopGear Im French,but i used to watch the French version,but not anymore,i simply cant get back to it,the English version is the best,end of story
TopGear I dont know what channel it must be on. But I would die to watch Top Gear UK here in the US
TopGear If you think that spanish is fast you should come visit where I live. Or just listen to spanish radio
TopGear thanks for broadcasting it in german  if you do it, when only with original (english) audio and german subtitles, not this gossiplevel wich they translate to...And lool at TG in Spain (brain overload coming :D )And btw: TG Australia has been RUINED with Season3, Season 2 was waaay better, season 1 was meh (mostly because of the primary host...)
TopGear The only thing that you can get a chance to win a free email service and the Price of the King of the Crown Estate is the most popular and the Price of the Crown Estate. The comments for your help. I have been a while to get your free time to time but I think the best way to get the best way to get the best way for the use of a new York City of London and the Price of course the UK and Ireland and Wales with company number of people who are looking for a couple of weeks ago by the way, and the Price of the Crown Estate
TopGear I love the original, and prefer to watch it in the original version, but I have to say that the German voices actually fit pretty well.
TopGear Im mexican, obviously my mother tongue is Spanish, however I cant stand anything the Spanish voice acting or abything else than the original. It simply is unnatural.
TopGear when you will come to saudi arabia
TopGear I loved the Ashes episode. One of the best they made.
TopGear Most Widely Watched Factual Television Programme in the World my gluteus maximus, does anyone remember their take on the Tesla roadster. Love the show but its only factual when it suits them.The High Court in London rejected Teslas libel claim, claiming the series is an entertainment programme and not an information programme.
TopGear no thanks keep the real voice
TopGear 5:00 The first time i drove a Mono it set fire to itself, the second time the engine went wrong and the third time it broke down before it even had left the factory. ...so its another typical British badly executed good idea...Its a bit like the Danish Zenvo.
TopGear music at 0:33 is from need for speed undercover :D
TopGear Top Gears production team reminds us why theyre the best. Great video. I wasnt expecting the car to be that expensive, though.
TopGear how about a drag race atom 500 vs bac mono
TopGear The Brits have to learn how to punt their unions so they can make stuff that actually works.
TopGear Absolutely beautiful!!
TopGear Is this car comparable to the Ariel Atom?
TopGear Start listening from 2:10 and onward. I loled so hard when he said If I was a girl... bit. XD
TopGear A big thumbs up to the boys and girls who assemble the APC (behind the producer chap) at Ricardos, Shoreham Airport. My.home town
TopGear Why one You know isnt enought?
TopGear Spoiler: Its just 3 and a half minutes of this guy talking.
TopGear The show lost its flare. Probably thanks to this guy.
TopGear even a behind the scene is better TopGear USA
TopGear reminds call of duty ghosts
TopGear What car is that in the background at 1:45?
TopGear i cant make it to top gear live anymore because they moved it from earls court to somewhere else, now if i want to see it i might as well rent a hotel room so i can arrive a day early rather than late.

TopGear I just love Tom  the umbrella. : ) I have never seen an umbrella do that in my life. I dont know how many times I have watched that part  always laugh. : )
TopGear If Loki was driving hed probably hit everyone that got in his way and didnt move
TopGear A bloody reckless one, muttering and shouting through gnashed teeth and plowing through shopping centers, his only source of joy being the claret spattered on his windscreen. A reluctant grin would crawl into the corners of his face as he counted each successive pedestrian passing from sight below his front bumper.
TopGear omg hes just like me!!! i also wears specs for driving on rainy days!!! we are soooo meant to be..xD
TopGear why didnt he fly trough the track.
TopGear Loki goes need for speed?
TopGear Englands great if youre a duck.Its either raining, just finished raining or just about to start raining.

TopGear OMG tractor... BAM hit the wall:D
TopGear They would NOT have aired that Stig had a Norwegian accent.....
TopGear its wet, its cold....its Britain!
TopGear So... Stig is Pal Virik Nilsen.
TopGear I like how the Stig had an umbrella when he wears an helmet.
TopGear I love how in the second interview bit, Stig had gotten out of the car like: Norwegian accent? Screw you, im gonna stand outside and someones gonna put an umbrella in my right hand so i dont melt.Since we all know liquid metal Terminators tend to melt.Or is it a Terminatrix? All we know is, hes called the Stig.
TopGear ciao, come fai a caricarli senza farti rompere x il copyright? a me lo hanno fatto
TopGear ugh... the slow motion ruins everything about this illusion.
TopGear I think people need to get over their feelings over inanimate objects. : Dont get me wrong I love cars too, but I wouldnt get too caught up in emotions over a flaming car.
TopGear do the lights flash at that speed in slow motion?
TopGear let me guest, jeremys idea, i bet he some where in the back rubbing his hands and an evil laugh, burn porsche burn..................
TopGear I clicked the Dislike button simply because, as an exPorsche owner, I couldnt bear to watch a supercar being torched.
TopGear That was beautiful....
TopGear I feel as though Jeremy had something to do with this...
TopGear That girl is so hot...because of fire I mean.
TopGear You can tell when the rating start to slip. Its when they waist money destroying beautiful thing in the name of entertainment.
TopGear 291 people are Americans who, for some odd reason, have a problem with associating flames and 911...

TopGear Awesome! Very suggestive :)
TopGear You guys, its urgent that you accept salvation from hell fire!All humans have sinned, and all our sins added together equal eternity in hell, on the other hand you can believe in Jesus Christ alone and he will save you.Jesus is the son of God Totally God and totally Man) who never ever sinned, was brutally killed on the cross for our sins, (each bad thing we do was left in a tomb, and recovered from death back to life.At the exact moment you believe in him alone, Jesus will add eternal life and forgiveness of sins to your life.
TopGear Its not nice to make fun of colorblind people.
TopGear The funniest thing I have seen in years!! I do wish this clip included a bit of the panels reaction to this in order to put in context.
TopGear The best part about cycling is no traffic laws.
TopGear Shit was that Frank Underwood with the double knuckle tap at the end?
TopGear Was hoping to see the planning of it. Christ on a bike! I thought it was just a metaphor but then Jesus comes riding a bike past them, rofld.
TopGear Richard, Jeremy and James on Phineas and Ferb, AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! :D
TopGear Shouldnt the stig have been somewhere in the background?
TopGear Some say, that he moonlights as a secret agent platypus,..And that his primary mode of transportation, is a shark equipped with tires...

TopGear Something different for us today, we went to the Top Gear Festival and loved the drifting and the fender bender action!

TopGear Crap cars!And when u have to save fuel, according to them, u must hit the gas and highest revs to be there as quick as possible instead of driving between 20004000 rpm?
TopGear Whr are all the Protesters?Sorry If any1 is Angry !
TopGear These Video are just too good i love these Guys.
TopGear Why dont they just drive laps around the high way, just keep getting on and off
TopGear Why not fill water jugs and carry them. Or bags of concrete. Easiest, just grab a shovel and fill the inside up leaving just enough room for you. You will be lucky just to get it moving,. LOL
TopGear I heard a certain Vladimir from Russia is also playing this game with a few of his friends, in military fatigue.
TopGear disabling the engine management system is the smartest thing he could do.my corsa b guzzles 35 l per 100 km instead of 7. nearly run out of fuel due to air mass sensor problem.
TopGear very nice...how much?
TopGear just going to throw this out there....it was probably absolute hell on the paint haha
TopGear Perfect BoysToys , a new challenge for RangeRover . A Completely BadAss car.

TopGear Is Richard going to build a 6 wheeled porsche 911 with all 4 rear wheels with dual rear axles being drive wheels? That would be hilariously awesome!

TopGear Top Gear  Mass Effect... the reapers has no chance
TopGear Oh good, I am not the only one who noticed they used the ME3 music on Top Gear.
TopGear I jumped out of my seat when the soundtrack started.
TopGear Sounds like disappointment
TopGear Hes driving an Aventador police car and yet he thinks a 6wheeled truck is unusual?
TopGear dude your fucking spider looks awsomee hahahah is fucking real!
TopGear AFTER SEEING THIS I WANT TO BE A ARABIAN COP NOW
TopGear So the million skyscrapers arent enough to show off the wealth?! They also have to give highend sports car fleets to the police?! I bet even Dubai has povertystricken people. Why not spend some of that money on them.
TopGear Near the start of mass effect 3 where the Normandy leaves earth to get help :)
TopGear Fuck theyve dumbed this show down over the years. It used to feel spontaneous and fun, and unscripted even though it probably was. Now they treat their audience like theyre total fucking morons!
TopGear I thought jet skis were cool. I thought quads were cool.
TopGear I love Top Gears challenges.
TopGear If they tried this in the states, Clarkson would have to be wearing a helmet and a life preserver. Plus the atvjet ski would be slower with all the required smog controls.
TopGear Alfa 4c is porn on wheels. In a good way
TopGear top gear  il piu bel programma riguardante il presente e le auto

TopGear RICHARD WHAT IS THAT ON YOUR FACE?
TopGear You guys cant do anything wrong. Another great Show!
TopGear The look of instant regret gets me every time
TopGear The best part is Tom  the umbrella. I have never seen an umbrella do that before in my life. : ) I have seen umbrellas ruined by the wind, but not like that. : ) I can always laugh at the umbrella part. : )
TopGear I usually dont watch Top Gear but I watched this one. Only the part with Tom. Im not a car fan and the only reason I know of the show is my family watches it. XD It was amusing.
TopGear Those three are bril. Hugh especially I didnt know he could be funny.
TopGear Only Americans go on a British show and laugh their arses off at a Brit using his own Britishisms.Murica.Lol!
TopGear I want a favourtie wooly jumper :D.
TopGear Kdo by nechtl mt svj oblben wooly jumper
ZONEofTECH Im sorry to say, youre not fully partnered, you areonly branded, which means you have some of the same options as a full partner, but you can not get banners on your view page, or on your youtube channel, you can not create a show and you can not make any money of it. Have you even signed anything with anyone? And btw, its not illegal to say what youre earning, nobody just talks about it, I gues.. Anyway, have a good day :)
ZONEofTECH I gonne solde hem in the game mainia
ZONEofTECH Would love to win this Game and thanks ZONEofTECH for doing all those giveaway Special when Christmas arrive .

GameSack haha i heard later, but i was like this must be a trick so i, in all my retarded glory, listened to the end of this video about 7 or 8 times, thinking there was some hidden word in the background noise...
GameSack Who said she was leaving Riot games? anyone direct me to the source that she is leaving?
GameSack muito masa vei muito bem feito : )
GameSack Wanna play a game?  1 sec LOL.
GameSack Renekton baits too strong
GameSack Zacs E actually stuns them for 1sec or so
GameSack MA BOY NEKU!! AKA ANONKUN
GameSack zileanop wheelchair scandal faking troll WTF LOL
GameSack Wow, I was staring focus to see whats going to happen...that was amazing
GameSack du bist schlecht muhahaha
GameSack its ace the enemie team and finish baron after that, thats a different, fucking moron
GameSack ich verstehe kein wort
GameSack Nice gemacht dicker.  Like if you dont understand the comment. :)
GameSack ENEMY TACTICAL GRAGAS INCOMING!! ITS OVER!!
GameSack Ingame footage would be really good, especially when discussing the skills. That way we can see visual demonstrations of what youre talking about.
GameSack This guide isnt really all that indepth, its just an item build with explanations. Theres also a really rather large difference between Renekton and Nasus ultimates in that Nasus ultimate gives him a good percentage of the damage he deals as bonus AD for the duration of the ultimate. Thus is it not unheard of to see Nasus with 1700 AD. This makes Renekton a lot less dangerous in comparison.
GameSack Nice builds and all, but I think you should first try dorans blade merc treadsbrutalizer spirit visage atmas impaler yomumus ghost blade quick silver sash and warmongs. note that this wont work for every team, and if they have a lot of squishies on their team, then you should get last whisper instead of atmas impaler, or if they have a jax, instead of yomumus get sword of the divine just in case. usually youll want to trade spirit visage for frozen heart later on for more cd and armor.
GameSack Hey! u know that this was back in the old days, and if i think back the pool turrent didnt do true damage on that time. but now it does so thornmails did help back then.
GameSack you COULD kill the pool turret, i remember a while ago the pool turret had a HP bar...
GameSack This comment made me literally laugh out loud
GameSack it does true damage now i think
GameSack I played in 2012, but i didnt know that LoL was from 2010... damn.
GameSack i like how its cooming blood out of the inhibitor when you hit it
GameSack lol U idiots dont know u cant hit pool till u break all other or all the mid turret with the nexus ones
GameSack Its now, but it used to be xxx amount of PHYSICAL damage.
GameSack It was called Zonyas ring, fuckface.
GameSack Artanis186 Sounds about right you would usually get that much after getting zhonyas and a few other items. But Ive had 1016 ap before it was extremely funny watching people run
GameSack just did first real game as veigar i only had time for like 100 ap and went 5 0 7... we kept raping them in team fights early on lol
GameSack BTW how did u get feed, they are playing 5 times better than your team :p

TopGear Wow I cant believe I missed this little gem, thanks for reuploading it!
TopGear I could be wrong, but dont Brits pronounce their rs?  You two sound like like people that have had a few too many in a pub around Boston. LOL Everything with a r ends with ah. Instead of water, it sounds like watah.  Anyhoo, congrats on 600 vids!

TopGear Because its automatic in real life.
TopGear I hate you Turn 10. You and your braindead fans.
TopGear Yet another shitty car pack..but atleast the new Holden v8 is in the game.
TopGear And what is on it top gear?Only the transit and that holden...
TopGear Forza 5 is such a disappointment.
TopGear Racing Holden, Nissan R390, original Elise, Audi RS4... yeah, Im JUST cool with buying this. Still want the Alfa 4C though...
TopGear The reason F5 has less cars? It was rushed for a launch title. Thats it. The car packs are bringing back some of the old favorites with new cars. If MS hadnt rushed F5 as a launch title, T10 probably would have had more time to model cars.
TopGear Hover van Time to show wincup whoes boss
TopGear Ford Transit SSV? Shut up and take my money!
TopGear Wheres the rest of COTF V8SC..??
TopGear Best racing game on the planet.And just look at dem graphics. Beautiful

TopGear that first camaro you were gonna use is one of the fastest drag cars in the game, mine does 8:600
TopGear it could be faster in real life in a 14 mile can do 7 sec. so you can make it faster
TopGear Notice how his info said playing from Canada. This is because no one knows the provinces if I spelled that right
TopGear I was watching top gear during the vid.
TopGear Looks like a instance of a Temple Runalike game with no interesting and nocharge twists.
TopGear I have an idea for a failrace va the community on GT6, similar to the nascars in the rain one. My idea is to have 1000hp rwd cars in the rain at night. I think it would be very chaotic and alot of fun.
TopGear Old white jag is an XJ120 from the 1940s used in a race between things from the 40s: the car, a bike, and a train
TopGear Does anyone remember the top gear 100 car challenge??

TopGear You got the wrong ram
TopGear I love your videos. Can you add me on the xbox 360. My gamertag is MADxDOGxD
TopGear Obviously when u switch from high powered drift machine to low powered drift machine is hard to drift because they both use different technique,if u watched the drift bible low powered car needs to drift on a high toque band so u can get the wheel spin
TopGear why dont we have the 720p option
TopGear Ar12gamingthat challange was my ideaim saiyanpotato
TopGear Use the 2000 corvette and upgrade it all the way tht thing is a beast
TopGear Where do I watch the live streams?
TopGear Gahhou o Inscrito numero 1.005
TopGear Did you know that Grindstone was made for this game? I would love to have this one, but its too hard to find.
TopGear I did own this as a kid and did love it. The two things I hated was the music and it was too easy to explode and thought it was too easy to fly off everything. I loved the secret cars though and i too wanted it because of the Expansion Pak.
TopGear not one ive played tbh glenn, it looks pretty decent and the sense of speed I can tell is there
TopGear Hey! This is an absolute amazing video! Your channel is absolutely amazing!I just started Youtube, and could use some comments and likes, do you mind checking out my channel? Thank you so much bro! I appreciate it, and keep up the excellent work!

GameSack but talon doesnt have claws .
GameSack can you extend dravens music?
GameSack He evolved his void spikes now...
GameSack One of my favourite champions
GameSack Vis isnt considered music, this is.
GameSack it has Hans Zimmer feeling :D (dark knight, inception, pirates, potter etc.)
TopGear What the fuck is this ?
GameSack Great ep.! You two are really funny together!
GameSack stop bitchin bout the damn giveaways do people really care?
GameSack Riot Games just gave away a free skin and champion (which would normally be like 20 dollars all together) to everyone for just subscribing to there already popular YouTube channel. I think its perfectly fine.
GameSack what exactly IS youtubes policy against? cause beauty gurus hold giveaways all the time too.
GameSack Will, about Riot Games 1. A bunch of people were already subscribed to their channel, I know I already was. 2 They werent giving away imaginary giveaways which a bunch of partners already do and 3. They didnt force people to sub to them, simply getting their already fans of the game to sub to their youtube page so they can share the news with them. They did not say like offer Cash for people subbing for a certain sub cap and do a giveaway. They didnt even get more players from it.
GameSack u guys are wrong about riot lol
GameSack I love Steve on here. :) Please have him on here all the time Will!
GameSack TheWillofDC Will there are plenty of partners who do giveaways everyday of the week, I know Phillip DeFranco does it on his show everyday. I do not know who has gotten banned for doing this, Im sure you are more knowledgeable about the situations than myself. Riot games didnt actually gain or lose anything. If you look at it like this, Riot games could have easily just had 100k people join youtube that wasnt already there and all and all isnt it about the community?
GameSack MadProps4U will look into it now.
GameSack This guy. Sounds. Gay
GameSack wonder how Tobuscuss channel is going? I love your show Will 3 thank you for doing it :)
GameSack Noooooooooooo, Shaytards has to climb up the chart :(
GameSack Werevertumorro es a Mexican (international) channel and he is doing well.

GameSack Almost time for WongfuProductions to join that 1 million subscriber club, GO Wongfuproductions!!!!!!!
GameSack Win for Halo lol!!! FTW!!!!
TopGear Somi Guha is racist in herself because she knows that the word slope has been a basic, core word for hundreds of years and has no ethical meaning in the slightest yet because the presenters are white theyre easy targets to accuse of racism. If we took offence at the Chinese word for flat for example Im sure theyll think were idiots if we try to sue them for having the word flat in a chinese TV show.
TopGear Pathetic. What about Fawlty Towers: The Germans, where the major talks about the difference between Wogs and Niggers, an then Fawlty insults the Germans for 10 minutes and does a Hitler impression. That still gets showed but nobody complains.
TopGear Big woop, get over it
TopGear Get in the van, Jeremy! Right. Good. ???
TopGear at 17:43 do not try this at home
TopGear 04:41 hahahahahahahahahaha
TopGear post the truck trip to alsaka.

ZONEofTECH All you speak English types do know that Samsung sells more phones outside the US than within, right? That to them, this is more of a global event?
ZONEofTECH WOW! So upset right now! Hello innovation anyone same shit dif day. Lets see what The fruit guys come up with.
ZONEofTECH Samsung has nothing new but a better camera on the new phone. Apple will once again out sell Samsung because Apple actually have something new to offer. If the iphone 6 has a 5 inch screen...game over. Cant wait to get the 6 and the awesome iwatch coming out.
ZONEofTECH help with cynegeaonmod please. Ive tried it twice and almost broke my phone once.
ZONEofTECH This is an awesome video! :) I heard from another rumor from ayoutuber that the backing would be metal like on the iphones.
ZONEofTECH What time will the meeting start in Eastern Standard Time in the US?
ZONEofTECH Notice the  Dancing ZoT logo at the end of the video which vibrateschanges colour depending on the music rythm. Took me around 5h to make that. I will be featuring it in all of my next video.BTW  quick side note: started recording the video at 7 a.m. Finished editing and uploading at 9 P.M. So yeah...Ive worked 14h on this (actually 13:30 because I went out to get something to eat).Like if you think the video turned out well and you appreciate my 13h and 30 minutes of work :)Thanks!DanZONEofTECH
ZONEofTECH its the same bullshit leak lies every year... thumbs down for tard video!
ZONEofTECH I think that the iphone6 will have a 2.4quadcore processor and 2gb of memory RAM and also an 12 megapixel camera with a led flash fingerprint will stay as she is in iphone5s but the frontal camera will be bitween 2 and 5 megapixel the storage is 163264128 and the display will be bitween 4.7 and 5.5 inch that what i think :)
ZONEofTECH Copy sumsung galaxy s4
ZONEofTECH How big is it... Im talking about the screen size just to be clear  lol XD
ZONEofTECH Spot the boring dork that really needs to.....GET A LIFE!DEATH TO IPHONE, LONG LIVE ANDROID!
ZONEofTECH Good quality video!!! All is good.... Info, audio, video, etc... Good job!!

ZONEofTECH Didnt get anything for Christmas, so I would be really happy if I win Sphero 2.0
ZONEofTECH I got a ps4 and sony laptop
ZONEofTECH santa bought me counter strike go :D
ZONEofTECH Wat is the music at the front part of the vid?
ZONEofTECH Before you keep saying the game is fully playable you should actually play the game. Your are in a closed off interior section with no enemies or action going on walking back and forth doing absolutely nothing lol. Try gliding around the city, fighting 10 bad guys outside or doing a boss fight and see if you get those frame rates. I never understand why people who make these videos always try always show the minimal amount of stuff going on and say its so playable at these specific settings. Then when unsuspecting people try it they are in for a rude awakening. Very deceiving is what Im talking about.
ZONEofTECH Is this being run on bootcamp or are you dual booting (not sure if thats even possible since I dont have much experience with Macs). Just wondering whether to buy this system or not
ZONEofTECH can you do one on Dota 2? it might not be the most intensive but since you already got steam and its free :D plsssssssssssssssssssssss
ZONEofTECH Just got the game, downloading to my 15 retina mbp 2013! :D
ZONEofTECH 1)install windows 72)turn the stupid aero off 3)play it laptop screen OR turn off the laptops screen and play it on your monitor.if you really want to get the real graphics performance thats what you gotta doall this in my respectfull opionion
ZONEofTECH Hey if you want, you can try recording with nvidia shadow play, it supposedly would impact performance less.
ZONEofTECH I am sooooooooo disappointed with the Intel HD graphics.On some games anti aliasing isnt even a option with Intel HD.Why a 3000 laptop with a bargain TV?
ZONEofTECH do u have company of heroes 2 ? in some places Company of Heroes 2 requires more hardware performance than Crysis 3.
ZONEofTECH I had the black iPhone 5 for a year and a half until two weeks ago but my 5 was perfectly spotless. But I actually take care of my phones, I dont just throw them in my pocket with my keys or pens and everything
ZONEofTECH NEW video!Retina MBP: Graphics  Performance benchmarks!:) Apple  RetinMacBookPro  Benchmarks MacBook MacBookProRetina
ZONEofTECH How many FPS can that produce with high setting for games with high graphic needs (like Saint Row IV  Hitman Absolution)?

ZONEofTECH Now these are the kind of videos, I like! Awesome video man keep up the good work!
ZONEofTECH In a way. Those videos were awesome but Im sitting here with my iPhone 4 looking for a way to control my computer with an iPhone. Haha.
ZONEofTECH I use FinalCut Pro X and Photoshop for the thumbnails if that counts. I spend around 48h on each video. Uploading one doesnt take that long, it takes around 30min with the internet I have here.
ZONEofTECH Yes, it does work on the S3 as well as the S3 Mini and the S4 Mini. Not to mention the Notes :)
ZONEofTECH dude you look like Andrew Garfield :) cheers.
ZONEofTECH Awesome video, but you sorta overused yourself in the video. Even though its awesome to finally know who you are, please just show the regular intro. Other than that, AMAZING!
ZONEofTECH i meant the camera not sd card, i liked it
ZONEofTECH Too much bla bla bla.... But its ok
ZONEofTECH Little bit to long! But i enjoyed

ZONEofTECH Nice job on this video. :) Ive been a fan of Apple products for a long time. And Im extremely impressed with how amazingly accessible they are for people whore blind, myself included. Im excited for IOS7 to come out, and for the new Siri voices. Its awesome that they sound like a real person, instead of a robot.
ZONEofTECH do u hav to zoom out to get to the menu or could u still click the home button
ZONEofTECH I had iOS 7 before this video :D
ZONEofTECH Skype works...but crashes a lot. Barely usable. I had to restart my iPhone twice until I was able to use Skype properly. Not sure about kik though.
ZONEofTECH Can this affect to the iPhone 5 ?

ZONEofTECH My iPhone now runs smoothly ! Thank you iOS 7 Beta 3 :D Get it now guys for free here : .kappleos7.om
ZONEofTECH IPhone  locked. No developers code, doesnt connect to itunes. What do i do?
ZONEofTECH Yeah I restored it but it says activation error is there another way without doing the software update
ZONEofTECH You only need beta 2 installed. To get beta 2 you need beta 1 and for beta 1 you DO NOT NEED a developer account if you follow my beta 1 video :)
ZONEofTECH No, simply go to SettingsGeneralSoftware update and it will find and install iOS 7 beta 3 automatically. Its exactly the same process as the Beta 1Beta 2 upgrade. :)
ZONEofTECH im back to 6.1.3, yup it laggs on the 4S not that much but yeah and crashes, one time it went dead, i couldnt do anything and i got scared, i just plugged it to charge it, and it started right away i started the downgrade to 6.1.3 OO, will wait for the final and official version......
ZONEofTECH You really are too harsh on it. This really is NO lag when you opened calculator its like you judging saying its bad when its in BETA 1. Compare it to an android and see the difference.
ZONEofTECH is it possible to downgrade to ios 6.1.3 again? if so how do i do it?
ZONEofTECH did he say anal growth rate LOL!
ZONEofTECH Oh, and btw, good vid. :) Im looking forward to the release of Mavericks :D.

ZONEofTECH Hello, well I registered in Bahamas as my previous Apple ID and password did not worked, :( so after this my itunes radio disappeared :(
ZONEofTECH Large shitmountain is this fake ios7. Why are you kill coverflow?? This was the best thing in Apple devices. This became a boring shit.
ZONEofTECH people who just clapping and not hving a single smile on their faces are android executives !
ZONEofTECH hands on your penis perhaps.. not on a mac pro
ZONEofTECH Hands on demo,My ass .
ZONEofTECH You can get 100 likes when you post an actual hands on video
ZONEofTECH For all you idiotic isheep out there, galaxies actually have something that is called group play, and you can do the something with pictures, music and documents, and that came out on the 4.1.1 update like say 8 months ago way before apple ever thought of it, apple is so far behind its not even funny
ZONEofTECH The guy with glasses at 1:00 looks like Bill Gates LOL
ZONEofTECH ever heard wifi direct? no? then watch this watch?vRM3Q1oiHTGU
ZONEofTECH U discovered bluetooth in 2013. Good job apple
ZONEofTECH Sucks its not for the iPhone 4 .
ZONEofTECH I agree all apple do is steal other peoples ideas
ZONEofTECH I did mention this in a comment :P It creates a closed WiFi network. It does not use bluetooth. A closed Wifi network is when multiple devices create their own private network and communicate through it. Therefore, you do not need to be connected to any WiFi network in order for this to work. I hope I was clear enough. :D
ZONEofTECH Very informative .. Very nice .
ZONEofTECH The thumbnail of this video was made by me, ask anyone on my Twitter too. iAust1n
ZONEofTECH That was a horrible preview of muliitasking
ZONEofTECH This practically makes the iPhone new all over again
ZONEofTECH have to get iphone 4 s sorry
ZONEofTECH lilkeith200 Yes, I am very impressed with Apple! Especially because of the fact they have done such an amazing job to make their products accessible for people like me whore blind, And those who have trouble seeing small print on the screen. Had it not been for them doing that, people with hearing and visual impairments would not be able to use their products at all.
ZONEofTECH I love how the new voices of Siri sound like a real person, and not a robot. Thats amazing. And I hope these new voices will also be used when using VoiceOver. Keep up the great work, Apple! You peeps rule!!! :)
ZONEofTECH Yes, it will be released for iPhone 4.
ZONEofTECH this is international??
ZONEofTECH You ask us yes or no. So do chicken lay eggs?
ZONEofTECH YES YES YES PLEASE MY MOM CANT AFFORD IT PLEASE CAN I GET IT? 9 subscribed and liked this vid! i favorited it and ive been subscribed for 2 months!
ZONEofTECH Im goning to use mac for my ipad
ZONEofTECH Im running mavericks and every time I try to open it after I have just installed it off of the internet I cant get it to open, it just says application not responding. What do I do?
ZONEofTECH Mine is EU west and it stops when it gets to 93. Can anyone help?
ZONEofTECH have you checked where the file is in applications?
ZONEofTECH Maybe its is dutch. It means little tree. Boom  tree, tje tells that it is small. Haha lol xD
ZONEofTECH Is the Xbox One controller rechargeable like the PS3 controller, or is it still powered by disposable batteries like the 360 controller? I know they have rechargeable battery packs for the 360 controllers, but theyre usually sold separately and their life span is extremely low.
ZONEofTECH nope, they still use batterys
ZONEofTECH is it chargeable or not
ZONEofTECH Shoutout to Barbara  Jack
ZONEofTECH OMG DREAMCAST 2 IS COMING
ZONEofTECH Haha the most trusted, reliable, popular gaming cpu is a piece of shit? No wonder none of your other comments make since. You have no clue what youre tlaking about.
ZONEofTECH Well I manage to contact Misfitsman805. You were the 2nd candidate to the prize, which means that if I couldnt get in touch with Misfitsman805, then you would get the prize, but since I did get in touch with him, he got the prize. Anyway, congratulations for being the 2nd and good luck next time :) Dont forget that Im doing an iPod Touch 5th generation giveaway, so be sure to participate in that one as well! Cheers opal!
ZONEofTECH I like the look of the first one, but thats all it was to me, was a look. I really like some of the ideas in the fifth concept
ZONEofTECH Dont reply to him, hes a troll...
ZONEofTECH nice! u should find a way to show it to then!
ZONEofTECH The fifth and the first ones, were the ones people liked the most, because looks similar to android and the number 1, looks exactly like miui, a custom rom for android, check and investigate before reply this message. By the way I think that the iPhone with ios7 would finally be a decent competitor for android 4.2.2 if ios7 looks like a mix of number 5 with number 1
ZONEofTECH yeah definitely they need to reinvent the ios, iphone design is perfectly fine, just update cpu gpu ram camera, done, and reinvent the shit of the os, thatll rocket launch them back on track
ZONEofTECH I like 1 a million times more than the real iOS 7.
ZONEofTECH 1 and 5 are the best two but number 1 is more likely to be developed
ZONEofTECH yeah hahaha tha is not ios seven stupid its faake
ZONEofTECH you no the 720 gonna be better than the p4
ZONEofTECH My information is correct. Learn English before posting comments like that.
ZONEofTECH It gonna cost 99 bucks were i live
ZONEofTECH im gonna buy a new smartphone and i want your opinion,whitch one should i buy: 1) the samsung galaxy s3 mini 2) the sony xperia go 3)the windows phone 8s by htc 4) the sony xperia P 5) the sony xperia J or 6) the sony xperia S please answer :)
ZONEofTECH no its called the iphone 5c, aka the iphone 5 crap
ZONEofTECH Christian Plummer 300 dollars, not pounds. Will probably be around 200 pounds
ZONEofTECH GUESS WHAT IPHONEC MEANS.HAHAHA MEANS IPHONE CRAP!
ZONEofTECH ,,all i can say is wooooow!!!.....when will it be available in the states and on which carriers?,,
ZONEofTECH Em. Ipad mini is 7.9inch
ZONEofTECH Yes android is better
ZONEofTECH Yes congratulation my favorite phone s3 mini
ZONEofTECH In the past I always thought that Samsung galaxy sucks, but Now I checked the new galaxys and those are a really competitive, in fact in some aspects are better than the iPhone. Samsung galaxy have better price, better battery and more free apps. I love iOS because is really simple, but android are quite the same shit. Sorry apple now my new phone will be the s g s3 mini! ( thank you zoneoftech for the videos, were really objective. Congratulation! Sorry for my English.
ZONEofTECH Ahaha! This was awesome. :D
ZONEofTECH Sanding galaxy s3 mini is better
ZONEofTECH but in many reviews they told that installing apps on the micro SD is unable. so the micro sd card is only use for photos,videos and music. so comparing 8GB with 16GB is not so fair.
ZONEofTECH Ive got the s3 mini and it runs smooth I would recommend it over the iphone 4s
ZONEofTECH When you have links in your videos to the s voice vs Siri and other things in your videos could you put a link in the description as well, because on the YouTube app on iPad you cant follow the link in the video :( . Good review :)
ZONEofTECH where is the 6th part??
ZONEofTECH Iphone 4s works better with 20 battery that the S3 mini ))
ZONEofTECH iphone has a smaller screen plus the retina display obviously the image quality looks better, I know iOS is better and no lags and stuff but truly you get annoyed and bored by iOS. for me definitely S3 is my choice considering its almost half the price and doesnt carry the famous front and back iphone glass which TRUST ME sometime youre gonna break it ... happens to almost everyone
ZONEofTECH s3 mini woW better and the qq prize
ZONEofTECH Letting the apps open was unfair with s3 mini coz iOS doesnt have multitask so s3 mini was working harder!
ZONEofTECH The iPhone has no anti aliasing either, the smoother edges are due to the higher pixel density! (you can see the same effect if you compare a 22 FullHD Screen with a 27 FullHD screen) Because the pixels are smaller the little stairs on the edges are smaller too.
ZONEofTECH logicly I Phone has a better camera than s3 mini because it has 8 mp and s3 mini has 5 mp.
ZONEofTECH I talk about the price at the end of the main video. Link is here: youtube.comwatch?vPghxzJE5eg
ZONEofTECH S3 mini is si cool!!!
ZONEofTECH Watch my entire series, all 8 parts of the EPIC BATTLES :D Your answer is in part 8 (main video) :)
ZONEofTECH Accurate video, but dont be put of the s3 mini. Remember this is comparing phones with a 300 difference, s3 is AMAZING for the price.
ZONEofTECH ZoneofTech Ok ) By the way have you tried gaming on the s3 and if so how good is it in this aspect?
ZONEofTECH 3:15 for the unboxing
ZONEofTECH Im so excited! im getting mine tomorrow !! :D
ZONEofTECH its the younger brother of s3 its the s3s child wtf
ZONEofTECH iphone5  710 galaxy s4  910 i think the Galaxy S4 is the new generation of mobile phones iphone5 looks good and has a simply system
ZONEofTECH Says right here that there is one. samsung comglobalmicrositegalaxys4
ZONEofTECH MAN!!!! (what is the PRICE???) I just sooooo have to buy it
ZONEofTECH grt video n samsung is hell load of features to stay ahead of iphone, they r history
ZONEofTECH I buy both of them but now it different to identify which one is good iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy S4
ZONEofTECH you can root your android device and its supposed to be better than the jailbreak
ZONEofTECH yeah, i b getting s4 in near future... its better than i phone bcause of special features like air touch , smart scroll,  adapt display...
ZONEofTECH iPhone 55S KILLER. team android
ZONEofTECH MegaBITS not BYTES...
ZONEofTECH Same with me. Thinking of getting this and keeping my iPhone just in case.
ZONEofTECH buy buy iPhone 5 ! ! ! !
ZONEofTECH Mopalit ko ani bisag pila pa ni
ZONEofTECH Looks good but Im very happy with my note 2 and if rumors are correct the note 3 will make the s4 look 3 yrs old
ZONEofTECH I thought it was a 1.9 gigahertz quadcore?
ZONEofTECH I still have the S2 and I have compared it to Ip5 and I know my S2 is better. What is Apple going to do to compete with S4... I dont know... Apple Lost the Hardware War, now Samsung is beating them in software... I only wish BLACKBERRY users would give Galaxy a try... any Galaxy... even the S2... which I now have... P.S. I was a Blackberry user from NEXTEL days... Blackberry was a Great phone... But you have NO ideal what you are missing with ANDROID. Same Goes for PALM dieHards.
ZONEofTECH WOW better specs  bigger!!!!!! THE BEST!
ZONEofTECH Its going to be completely premium finished and have a touch home button
ZONEofTECH facebook.compagesSamsungGalaxyS4Giveaway430970456993569 Like them on Facebook theyre giving away Samsung Galaxy S4 thumbs up this comment! 3
ZONEofTECH Samsung sucks !! Dun update yr galaxy s3 to jelly bean ....as soon as u do the phone will soon die a sudden death .... The software has a bug tat fucks the mother board !! N it dies ... N the worst part is that Samsung is shameless enough to not rectify the fault or brave enough to accept its fault .... Even after numerous articles of it on the web .....of the gs3 sudden death issue !!! I had the same problem n even my phone is under warranty !! ...Samsung told me tat my phone was water logged
ZONEofTECH hey you toddler! dont assume which side I am! my point si samsdung gaylaxy shits is copying apple stratey which means apple is shitting also. at least apple having reasonable price than samdung plastics lagdroids ! but apple are just too expensive not practical. but cheap lagdroids u arent satisfied also when using it!
ZONEofTECH i think i want to hate the game
ZONEofTECH Better than the S3 and iPhone 5 for sure. Not sure about the specs though.
ZONEofTECH The new xbox will most likely top 164 GB per second
ZONEofTECH I dont give a flippity fu if PCs graphics are better. This is phenomenal for a console. I am definitely going to buy one when it goes cheaper.

ZONEofTECH It would like Cool and elegant watch

ZONEofTECH Can you do a video when ipad5 come out
ZONEofTECH what the fuck this is not ture it is September you are fucking lieing u big fucking asshole
ZONEofTECH If only the iPad 5 supports Phonecalls.....i guess that would be handy...
ZONEofTECH Is my time wrong or is that 7 months ago?
ZONEofTECH WOOT :D haaha, I havent noticed that. :D
ZONEofTECH Now you know thats not happening fucking amateur
ZONEofTECH A7x not A7 . A7 is for phones and ipfo touch .
ZONEofTECH Its EarthNeutron Add me.
ZONEofTECH I had to look at this with the iPhone 6 coming in about 6 months (if Apple continues with their current release schedule). Not a single thing predicted about the 5s was correct in this video. lol
ZONEofTECH why are there samsung adverts
ZONEofTECH i really think they took it to far with by changing the icons it just dont have the emboss look anymore...
ZONEofTECH I like apple but lets face it they never improve the battery
ZONEofTECH i think it is going to be the same thing as it antessesor
ZONEofTECH The new ifone will be came in sell in the next year becose ifone 5 is the best on the markets so the will be waiting for the  so you have to waiting for 1 year
ZONEofTECH I dont think its going to come in colors until iPhone 6 but if it does it definitely not those colors those are those icolor things
ZONEofTECH i think the iphone 5s needs to beat the samsung 4s because most people are getting them now
ZONEofTECH i cant find the sync button!
ZONEofTECH Thanks for the review!
ZONEofTECH This is cool! I just got a free iTunes Card Code and it worked! Check this site out freeitunesforever com
ZONEofTECH oh i finaly figured it out but thanks for helping
ZONEofTECH Lol papa roach, is there actually really a singer named like that?
ZONEofTECH It could be OS X 10.10, 10.11 etc
ZONEofTECH OS X Mountain Lion and I never switch, only upgrade.
ZONEofTECH I have a question. If you update to Mac OSX lynx, what kind of background will you get?
ZONEofTECH Hey there, cool video I am using Mac too and would of cause do the switch if my late 2006 iMac would support anything higher than 10.7. Thanks
ZONEofTECH I use a Custom Operating System, and I will not switch.
ZONEofTECH Dont know why you hated Xbox, the multiplatform games for Xbox are way better.
ZONEofTECH LIE SONY MAKES BLURAY
ZONEofTECH Xbox because have halo and better graphics and faster at internet
ZONEofTECH Intel 4 core? Lol  core for PS4
ZONEofTECH Why did he say that the next Xbox will be 300 dollars, the same as the current one when the current one only costs 200 dollars. Unless he is talking about Kinect included.
ZONEofTECH on board speakers? if my tv doesnt have speakers. what? thats probably going to in microsoft terms jack up the price by a 100.
ZONEofTECH A 2 screen controller is gay
ZONEofTECH Actually they lose money on new consoles for the first few years. They make the money on game sales. Look it up.
ZONEofTECH Ps is better overall, that kinect is the truth though. So, Xbox or ps4? How about both!
ZONEofTECH tell me how if you ready???!!!
ZONEofTECH it is still working in 2013?
ZONEofTECH FUCKING IDIOT SURVEY DONT DOWNLOAD U CAN DOWNLOAD BUT RAR FILE ASKS FOR PASSWORD AND TO GET IT U NEED TO DO A SURVEY FUCK U ALL IDIOTS ...GOD DAM U NEED SOMETHING AND A SURVEY POPS!!

ZONEofTECH now it is but you cant play online :((
ZONEofTECH random is locked but terran unlocked ?
ZONEofTECH Didnt work. Its not fair or is it?
ZONEofTECH Yup, exactly. Thats what I said in the video. On Android it actually can control apps and its even faster than Siri (but the difference is not that huge in terms of speed, just a couple of seconds)
ZONEofTECH Screw this, look at LEAP MOTION, truly amazing, soz about dising u
ZONEofTECH Lets take that Like bar to 100 likes shall we :D ?

ZONEofTECH Please help, do i still download the 32 bit version of linux when my mac is 64 bit? Thanks!
ZONEofTECH No, but Siri works exactly the same on both the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 4S. No differences at all.
ZONEofTECH Yes it did. Thats why Apple built their own Maps App. Because Google didnt update the Google Maps App for iOS since its introduction in 2007.

ZONEofTECH he makes me cry wen he talks :(
ZONEofTECH Apple started working on the iPad years before they made the iPhone so shut up about that dum windows tablet cus apple all ready had made a tablet
ZONEofTECH The LG Prada was released in December 2006. I know what youre talking about. Apple posted an iPhone prototype from 2004 which had almost the exact same design like the current iPhone 4S. The LG Prada Prototype dates back from June 2005, so the iPhone was designed way before LG started designing the Prada. And no, this is not dribble, this is what people like you refuse to believe, that a company shamelessly copied Apple and refuses to admit it.
ZONEofTECH The best is Apple invented the tablet. You really are a moron. Check out Knight Ridder. Do some research before you post this nonsense. Apple Moron
ZONEofTECH my first phone its fantastic
ZONEofTECH have you seen it in person?
ZONEofTECH You are doing cool reviews
ZONEofTECH I just wanna see this and idk why Im seeing this

Ive always wanted one, I can always switch back if I get tired of it, but I dont think I will.. When ever I get addicted to unboxing videos I usually get it
ZONEofTECH I have a USB CABLE for an Ipod 30 GB, Im wondering whether such cable fits on Iphone 4s? Thanks for your answer
ZONEofTECH by the way i noticed some problems regarding the latest updateof macosx. i have the 10. 8 .2 mountain lion and it doesnt work at all the trimer app.. what i should do ?

Cheers!
ZONEofTECH Why do Germans get the best music?
ZONEofTECH what background noise?
ZONEofTECH What is the thickness of an SSD for an early 2011 Macbook Pro 17 inch?
ZONEofTECH Had one till my cousin chucked it in a corn field
ZONEofTECH I care about music, i just dont have billions of songs. You would get this one BECAUSE its smaller, thinner, lighter. Sure, Its not a big difference, but the price is VERY different.
ZONEofTECH Hold the play button.
ZONEofTECH where did you buy this?
ZONEofTECH Cool :D and youre english is fine, thrust me Anyway, if you liked my video please SUBSCRIBE and like it so more people can see it. Thank you :)

screenjunkies Obrigada, irei testar! :)
screenjunkies No sei o que  mais ridiculo... ter que esperar um minuto pra ver um video por causa de um comercial, esse comercial ser ridculo pra cacete ou esse comercial ser de um carro ridiculo como o UP.
screenjunkies That film is retarded . Now Im going to be flamed but oh well.
screenjunkies I 4 you screen junkies
screenjunkies Was that George Carlin?

retrogametech Bought this today from Glasgow Oxfam for 3.99 Yippee
retrogametech HPZeta Haha, I always played on consoles growing up so never really played any point and click games. But, thats the cool thing about this book. No I know :P Yeah I was surprised it was so cheap. 10 is very good value. Id have paid more.
retrogametech Its a Dreamcast Controller. Thats a console from late 90s early 2000s.
retrogametech Have you ever played Manhunt 1 or 2?
retrogametech Myst was the worst 20 Ive ever spent. Should have got StarCraft.
retrogametech Can someone tell me what Wii games are there in the book? I took a quick look at it the only time I found it in stores and saw there was quite a bit but I dont know them all, and since I have a Wii I may try some of them.
retrogametech Diesel powered dreamcast lol
retrogametech jeffhardy300wwe At least the dreamcast will always be better than your spelling.

screenjunkies the guy is fucking nuts but hes living the dream so fair play and all the best to him
screenjunkies Big Kids love this video.
screenjunkies nenenenenenenenenenenenene batman.
screenjunkies Before any Sean Long fans dislike this video and unsubscribe from jon3.0 cause they think Jon is serious, check Seans comments below. CLEARLY these guys are buddies.
screenjunkies ARTICULATION!!! this is hilarious man! im surprised you didnt mention him saying 360 degrees.
screenjunkies I expected dislikes. Not everyone likes or gets roasts between friends.
screenjunkies LOVE YOU JON ME AND MY FRIEND ARE LIKE YOUR BIGGEST FANS!! WE WANT TO PAY YOU NARRATE OUR DAY AT COLLEGE!!!
screenjunkies The only thing I dont like about your videos is the way that the sound dramatically changes from quiet to loud, I have to keep changing the volume to cope with that. Otherwise, congratulations on your video making abilities!
screenjunkies Superman looks like a Turtle
screenjunkies Hal really enjoyed Human Centipede.
screenjunkies YES NOSTALGIA CRITIC!
screenjunkies NOSTALGIA CRITIC!!! :D
screenjunkies I dont mena to be rude but...... When I have headphones on and listen to your voice m ears hurt.. A LOT
screenjunkies I think that this man is the 2nd best Hal there is.My number 1 isnt probably a mystery to anyone who has eyesight.
screenjunkies abstinncia de breaking bad!!!
screenjunkies Momento jovemnerd haha
screenjunkies Yeah Mr. White. Yeah science! Jesse Bruce Pinkman
screenjunkies Cof Cof ! Salve Mrs. White !
screenjunkies Audio in English.Legendas brasileiras.
screenjunkies Faz do O homem de ao e do Gente Grande
screenjunkies Assista esse etnicamente amados heris serem trazidos  vida como... crianas genricas brancas!
screenjunkies Vince Vaughn looked pissed...
screenjunkies You definitely got on his nerves when you asked about Jennifer Aniston.
screenjunkies mmmmmh... pretty terrible and not funny :S
screenjunkies Something funny... :P
screenjunkies lol you can tell vince vaughn was so annoyed with the google questions but he handled it well
screenjunkies Something funny... Wheres my fucking shirt?!
screenjunkies Hals been pumping that iron.
screenjunkies Do RED for the release of RED 2!!!
screenjunkies How to make a scion fast.........Buy a Honda accord.
screenjunkies Vin diesel he used to be a bouncer at a night club in NYC
screenjunkies Vin Diesel is better than The Rock because while Vin Diesels acting seriously leaves something to be desired, compared to watching The Rocks acting selfmutilation seems preferable.
screenjunkies What is a supercharger? What is an intake manifold? What is an engine system?
screenjunkies You want us to pick whos better between The Pacifier or The Tooth Fairy? Can suicide be a choice?
screenjunkies Rock, scissor , diesel.. wait what?
screenjunkies they made a 6? why? do people actually watch that!?!?!?
screenjunkies the rock. hes taller. otherwise, theyre both pretty much the same: gentle giants who are known for playing tough guys.
screenjunkies You forgot Tasha Yar, which would be in at least the first TNG movie reboot. Played by Charlize Theron.
screenjunkies I think they should reboot Seaquest DSV or Space above and beyond.
screenjunkies I got Better idea. Why dont we do a Star Trek Voyager Reboot with the Muppets. And Have Miss Piggy as Captain Janeway.
screenjunkies tom cruise !?!? nooooo
screenjunkies i vote for the original crew and for abrams to be thrown in the brig
screenjunkies Alex Kingston as Beverly Crusher
screenjunkies Couldnt we just do a new TNG movie with the original cast, with Bryan Cranston as the villain or something?
screenjunkies Jim Parson for Data!!! Are we even discussing this?
screenjunkies Its still too soon to reboot next gen without keeping the original cast. Theres no reason they couldnt just create new characters, and a new ship for that matter.
screenjunkies I do love me some Zach braff, but this seems kind of shameless, Zach
screenjunkies Goddammit Hitler. I though you died
screenjunkies Umm, you want money to take money away from someone else? that sounds really useful
screenjunkies So how do we solve this. Force people not to donate to rich people? Or force people not to create money campaigns when they already make a certain amount of money. Either way, that seems like a lack of freedom in all aspects. Why should we control what people want to start kicking and donating?

screenjunkies Unless this is some form of metatrolling where you purposefully become hypocrites to reveal the stupidity of the situation, this is fucking stupid. Dont back people with money to do vanity projects that they could fund themselves, now fund us to make a vanity project that we could fund ourselves. GENIUS TROLLING OR COMPLETE HYPOCRISY! I agree that perhaps the money could be put to better use or other projects by those with less financial clout but really? Not worth an Indiegogo campaign :P
screenjunkies Was this for real? Dont give the guy whos going to make A FUCKING MOVIE that you might want to see money, instead give us money to help protest giving the other guy money so we can print an ADVERTISEMENT telling people not to give the guy who is MAKING A MOVIE money? Fuck, youre stupid.
screenjunkies the money going to zach braffs movie could go to a million other more worthwhile causes, especially since zach had already secured funding from worldview entertainment..I approve of using kickstarter as a way to allow fans to get more involvedhave unique experiences like going to screeningsparties. but alot of these things are just riding on veronica mars coattails. VM NEEDED kickstarter because if they couldnt prove they had sufficient support, WB wasnt going to allow filming.
screenjunkies Heres food for thought, i found a good cause to donate money too. My hockey gear collection of pro stock hockey gloves. Rich people ask me for money? Cheers bud, i have new gloves coming already.
screenjunkies I had to watch Chasing Amy and Watchmen with my pairents... Not fun.
screenjunkies I watched the whole Dexter series with my mum... it got pretty awkward during the sex scenes!
screenjunkies This lady is awesome.
screenjunkies Human  Centipede  Spiders. Brilliant.
screenjunkies Tom Six YOU ARE A SICK MOTHERFUCKER!
screenjunkies Who would watch that with their mom
screenjunkies The perfect mothers day present
screenjunkies Whoa, your lists kinda sucked. Fast and Furious? Pacific Rim? I would have actually put Elysium towards the top. Wolverine sucked. 2015 should be interesting. Man of Steel was awesome!
screenjunkies Devin was hilariously wrong about Star Trek and Wolverine
screenjunkies all of the predictions were wrong.. it so weird how the things went, right?
screenjunkies Where did you get those numbers? Iron Man 3 made like 1.4 Billionaaronfialho
screenjunkies I dont know about everyone else but iron man sucked, fucking awful movie
screenjunkies oh lord these people were so dumb
screenjunkies X3, Wolverine Orgins, Electra, Blade 3, Fantastic Four and many more say hello.
screenjunkies Im so excited for Pacific Rim...I really hope its good. So far Star Trek: Into Darkness and World War Z are my favorite summer movies.
screenjunkies The movie everyone wants
screenjunkies Whether you think its bad or good, it doesnt matter, its the biggest hit of the summer.
screenjunkies I would like to meet Liam Neeson.
screenjunkies if i came face to face with chris nolan i would kidnap him and keep him in my basement so he could tell me stories forever. or we could become an inception team
screenjunkies I would like to meet either Vin Diesel for movies or Chester Bennington for a music interview.
screenjunkies id freak out if i met nick mundy. hes freakn adorable!!!

screenjunkies Like Gandalf told Charles Xavier, with great power comes great responsibility! :p
screenjunkies Beam Me Up Skywalker! Now what?
screenjunkies you do not belong there are ones before you
screenjunkies Lets be honest, the only holiday that would be worth it is either national SupesBatsWonder woman day(honoring a day they were born or died) or Changing Fathers day to IAmYourFather Day, causing all dead beat dads to reconcile with their sons and daughters they had abandoned or else they be electrocuted, and thrown off a bridge.
screenjunkies what is the name of the stare music?!!
screenjunkies hahahhahaha i really love twilight Im like the biggest fan of twilight, but this is just so funny i cant stop laughing! :D
screenjunkies HAHAHAHA this is the best one

screenjunkies I think I just watched the whole movie. I havent seen the movie but now I know whats going on...through painfully awkward stares.
screenjunkies Did I just waste half an hour of my life watching the stares of Twilight? Damit, the realization make me feel how sad my life is!!
screenjunkies To quote the Honest Trailer of Paranormal Activity,  Stairs, stairs, stairs...
screenjunkies They missed a golden chance at comedy, I know I would have laughed if Edward closed Bellas mouth for her. He would have even gotten some respect for it.
screenjunkies ...why do her stares look like shes having poorly concealed orgasms...?
screenjunkies FUCK YOU PURGE WHY YOU DIS 2 US!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Resorting to making jokes about Adeles weight and accent, yeah not Screenjunkies at its best here...

screenjunkies I want Steve Guttenberg to host the Oscars.
screenjunkies cicero from skyrim should host the oscars because....just because
screenjunkies Hollywood doesnt give a shit. Only thing that matters is getting u to pay for a ticket because they can always get you to see the next movie.The hopeadope strategy, lol.
screenjunkies Justice league, avengers, x men , Star Wars, spider man , dead pool, death stroke, black Adam, silver surfer and Loki team up together to fight galactus.
screenjunkies I WANT EVERYONE TOGETHER!!!!!!
screenjunkies How about Hulk, Superman, and Thor.
screenjunkies Spiderman and Deadpool.
screenjunkies Id like to see all the avengers  xmen caught inside the matrix and trying to beat Neo wahaahaha, Imagine the look on their faces when neo bends wolverines blades like a spoon!
screenjunkies Best teamup to emphasize would be a StormBlack Panther Movie. Or maybe Magik and Nightcrawler for awesome teleportation fights.
screenjunkies They said it doesnt take place in the same universe as avenger but scarlet witch and quick silver are cast in both Xmen days of future past and Avengers 2 age of untron so it should be the same universe
screenjunkies I just want to see Wolverine fight the Hunk to be honest!
screenjunkies hulk and black widow, and it would go like this, HULK SMASH!!!!
screenjunkies So... Hal. Did you get lucky?IN YOUR EYES

screenjunkies Those bitches are dumb!
screenjunkies Since when speaking Greek makes you cast spells hahahahha lol at the blond bitch.Ermi mou se parakalo dose mou mia parkiera, kratise tin anihti gia menaGEEZUS!!!!
screenjunkies I could not stop laughing at the spell casting.
screenjunkies Would you call this movie your Schindlers list? What the fuck kinda question is that xD
screenjunkies hmm.. I go with Decapitate and burn the body in style from John Sinclair Ghosthunter. Better make sure the zombie dies, oh if there is bunch of them, I would love a flamethrower and handgrenades
screenjunkies You deserve the tshirt
screenjunkies Best way to kill a zombie for me is to snipe them from a helicopter distance is best and either a silencer or suppressor so to cause the zombies to go in one direction or so they dont know what hit them.
screenjunkies Most effective way to kill zombie: punch to bladder.
screenjunkies Did he just say The Walking Dead was bullshit I am going to kill him
screenjunkies Get clementine to shoot em
screenjunkies TOMAHAWK CHOP TO A ZOMBIE BRAIN v
screenjunkies Funniest thing Ive watched in a long time.
screenjunkies I agree with human centipede
screenjunkies have not seen this film but a friend of mine told me he would buy this movie only to play the film backwards so it would have a happy ending i think he was trying to be funny somehow
screenjunkies im the only one who think, if he wear a moustache he look like Borat
screenjunkies As a comic book fan, I am more offended by The Big Bang Theory than Django Unchained.
screenjunkies How about George Lucas  that guy took a dump on what could have been 3 great prequels and then sold the franchise to Disney after he milked us for our money.
screenjunkies Grown Ups 2 with built in laugh tracks. Poo sold seperately
screenjunkies I literally have NO idea why it would be offensive, someone pls tell me.
screenjunkies legende a do filme do skyfall
screenjunkies The Amazing SpiderMan was great! Better than 2002s! Except we didnt need the retold origin.
screenjunkies Michael Barrytel almost lost all my respect for him with that Amazing SpiderMan comment. Its not copying plot points. Its about being faithful to the source material. He doesnt understand that both SpiderMan movies were based on the same comic book. And Amazing SpiderMan did SpiderMans origin better. You cared more about Peter, more from Gwen than Mary Jane, and more for Uncle Ben and Aunt May (who were really strongly written characters this time, (RIP Cliff Robertson).
screenjunkies WWE Films is Snubbed again.
screenjunkies Hey, Cloud Atlas was not a piece of garbage.
screenjunkies Um wtf is Nick talking about? Cloud Atlas is not even close to deserving being nominated for a razzie so he can shut it.
screenjunkies Is everyone forgetting the chick from dark knight rises? Worst death scene ever! Guess they already hit their budget for the movie so they couldnt replace her since she was doing so well up until that point and just said f it, cut, and print it. Guess they thought she would take away from all the other mistakes and unexplainable scenarios in the movie. Well guessed wrong, just made the list longer.
screenjunkies my three: twilight, mouthbreather and sparkly vampire. I hope to god that franchise gets buried to the darkest parts of the world and gets completely forgotten. Thats saying a lot, cause i despise Milla Jovovich for staring in RE movie series that has forever buried any hope of a good RE movie for a long time, thanks to Paul Anderson who hasnt directed a good movie period, and the fact that Tyler Perry was basically nominated TWICE for worst actor, I mean damn you gotta have skill at bad acting to get it twice but I STILL want twilight to win in all three catagories.Rant. Over.
screenjunkies As for The Amazing SpiderMan, it wipes the floor with SpiderMan 3, and some of the part one, too.Ok, that is my opinion. But, seriously, Spidey 3 could not have been WORSE than it was.When people talk about the BatmanSpidermanSuperman movies, and the way they are portrayed onscreen, it is quite tough, because over the years, ALL of these superheroes went through MANY TRANSFORMATIONS, REIMAGINATIONS, REINVENTIONS, reworked origin stories. So, if you like the 1960s Spidey, you like Sam Raimi and his Spidey 1 and 2. If you like the 1950s Superman, you like Superman 1 and 2 (actually, if you like ANY ERA Superman, most people love Donners FIRST TWO Superman movies. The less said about the other 2, the better. Suffice to say, Singers Superman Returns was WAY better than those two, aside from the WORST Lois ever, Kate Bosworth, an overrated actress).What some people do not understand is that the carefree, childlikeinnocentkookykiddy versions of some superheroes CANNOT work in todays world. EVERYTHING WAS DIFFERENT, whether in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s or 90s. Everything reflects the changing of the times. The politics, the comic books, the movies, the TV shows, music, fashion, technology. WE SHOULD ALL TAKE ALL THIS INTO ACCOUNT, even when we talk aboutreview movies that are remade, reimagined or rebooted. There are many cultoriginal moviescartoonsTV shows that arewere VERY MUCH overrated (no need to get into detail here, just go online and check for yourselves).Tastes and opinions are subjective, the things we lovepeople we likemoviescartoons that we watch, music we listen to. But we should give everything a chance, well, anything that has any trace of QUALITY, ORIGINALITY, COOLNESS, COMPETENCE, TALENT, EFFORT behind it. If it has NONE of this, let it disappear from this world. That is quite simple really, we are human, we have brains, we know how to use them!Cheers :)
screenjunkies Some more ideas to potentially fix Die Hard 6:Bring the setting back to Nakatomi PlazaBring back John McClanes everyman status by making his age a factorGo the Last Cruade route and cast Clint Eastwood as John McClanes father.Recast John McClanes son (maybe with Channing Tatum?)Hans Grubers son played by Daniel Radcliffe?
screenjunkies Did you seriously just say the first movie was believable???? Really?????
screenjunkies The villain for Die hard 6 should be Hans Grubers son
screenjunkies John Tucker Must Die Hard
screenjunkies Nick Mundy is awesome
screenjunkies Die Hardest 2015.............. check IMDB......... set in Tokyo...................
screenjunkies The Die Hard series is beyond repair after this travesty and the last. Please Bruce we know you are an old sellout, but you should have at least let your best character die hard with some dignity.
screenjunkies Die Hard 18: This dude just isnt gonna fucng die hard, is he
screenjunkies I think I found an easter egg....
screenjunkies Live Long and Die Hard
screenjunkies I liked here comes the boom and the watch, but thats my boy was just something I was fine watching for free on HBO but would hate to see in theaters.
screenjunkies All the women from Game of Thrones
screenjunkies John Carter was actually a good movie! Not great, but fun and enjoyable
screenjunkies Well, maybe I like this kind of film (and I saw it three times) so I pretty much got it andor found a reason to explain things. The guy turned into a zombie cause of the black gooacid combo that changed his biological makeup.

screenjunkies Jesus was never meant to be funny.
screenjunkies TNG with: Shakira as Deanna Troi (no one understands her anyway) Jim Parsons as Wesley Crusher (he can play a genius and irony never fails with fans) Helen Keller as La Forge (it just makes sense) Nicholas Cages Forhead as Worf The Situation as Riker (Why not?) James McAvoy as Picard (RIGHTFULLY SO) Kate Walsh as Bev Crusher (she knows how to play a doctor and her career is going nowhere anyways) AAAND...... Jennifer Lawrence as Data for her robotic deliveries
screenjunkies Data is a robot, right? Kristin Stuart could pull that off...
screenjunkies youve got sexy legs :D
screenjunkies Dont waste that! Its still good food!
screenjunkies Data would be Kristen Stewart.
screenjunkies How do you know youre not getting reeled in by this girl?Because I already fuked her. XDWhat power would you like?The power of flight.Why?So I can take girls up into the sky. And if they dont fuk. They dont come down.Oh god, I cant look at Superman the same again.
screenjunkies This movie is badass. Everyone go see it now!
screenjunkies They should make a movie about Tim Burton and have Johnny Depp play Helena Bonham Carter.
screenjunkies More Bizarro than Superman :P
screenjunkies SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS
screenjunkies This is absolutely disgusting
screenjunkies so I thought I was watching a video about the hollywood Superman, and then it turned into two creepy dudes watching nudes
screenjunkies lol, this superman is a giant pervert. Its like Patrick Stewart in Extras.

screenjunkies 2:12 actually in my country the y have bacon but it is not made out of pork

screenjunkies no curti, achei ofensivo
screenjunkies Bom, acho que alguns no entenderam The Hunger Games :
screenjunkies Im sorry but this could have been awesome but you made it uninteresting. I wasnt feeling it.
screenjunkies 0:30 I salute the girl who dressed up as Lightning Farron (shes next to The Incredible Hulk). 0:39 is that Axel I see? Even though they lost, the two who dressed like that won in my book!
screenjunkies Classic Nick Fury.. lol...But I love Sam
screenjunkies i know who darth nihlus is
screenjunkies Ciel doing nothing... makes such a change from the series....

screenjunkies That jack sparrow lookalike looks just like the one from the movies
screenjunkies Beat alcoholism with the Two Broke Girls Drinking Game, take a drink every time you laugh
screenjunkies Walking dead drinking game: drink everytime the music builds up and zooms in on someones face.
screenjunkies Walt Disneys gravesite will be pissed on
screenjunkies Some of this was highly dangerous. In Ky you could have been shot. That being said, some of these people are rageoholics, and need therapy.
screenjunkies A jedi would not have pulled a dumb prank like this....
screenjunkies its actually so cringy that its funny p
screenjunkies On the contrary, people dislike this because they have a good SENSE of humor, as in high quality taste in comedy and do not get a kick out of annoying people. I dont even consider this a type of prank, Its just two goofballs walking up to a person going about their business and says this is not your cellphone and runs away with it. Where is the practical joke in that? If you are amused by this then you have a very very poor taste in comedy.
screenjunkies 20 says that chick was a feminist. meets new person first question are you going to vote for Obama?
screenjunkies I want a prize so umm waves hand Give me the prize
screenjunkies Im honestly surprised no one punched you. That would have been funny no offense.

screenjunkies They look so unhealthy and ill.

screenjunkies Honey Boo Boo is he most stupidest load of rubbish, Ive seen for ages.
screenjunkies Christopher Walken, Colin Farrell and Sam Rockwell with a dramatic interpretation of Honey BooBoo
screenjunkies O.M.G.!!!all that Vajiggle Jaggle? ROFLMAO!
screenjunkies Honey Boo Boo is a terrible thing... except when put in the hands of Christopher Walken...

screenjunkies Well, jovem nerd means young nerd in portuguese, so a portuguese or brazilian dood is fucking with us.
screenjunkies not sure if its all the footage but most definitely bruce willis part of the scenes were from The Kid and gordonlevitts scenes were from Angels in the Outfield.. its a mash up of the scenes from those 2 movies...
screenjunkies make a honest trailer for looper
screenjunkies It means Young Nerd in english. Is a web site from Brazil about Comics, Movies and other things...

screenjunkies Usual Suspects... Lowbudget expectations lead to a huge success... Perfectly written as well.
screenjunkies 1) Batman Returns2) Terminator 2
screenjunkies Honestly, the best movies mentioned in this review are, well, kind of a sausagefest. No Disney movies mentioned, no romantic comedies mentioned (Pretty Woman!), no romances (no Titanic or Ghost?), no Clueless? Oh, right. Because ladies.
screenjunkies You guys realize you spoiled the 6th Sense on the worst M. Night Shyamalan movie episode.

screenjunkies bury all copies and memory of any of them being made, at Fukushima
screenjunkies Should do How to Fix: Red Dawn, Robocop, and every 80s movie theyre remaking as PG13
screenjunkies Thankyou for calling this bs they try to pass off as transformers!still pissed off about jazz
screenjunkies if Grimlock doesnt call himself a king. im going to smack a B.
screenjunkies What sucks is that they make these idea videos after theyve already finished filming the movie.
screenjunkies So funny! JeffGoldblum
screenjunkies Megan foxes ass was worth the entry
screenjunkies never bothered to watch any transformer Micheal Bay films, am a fan of the animated series n anything referenced on robot chicken. however now transformers is like xbox, alot of people want it....but only half are smart enough to say hell no to that stinking garbabe in the first place. FYI always have been a playstation gamer :)Also Nick Mundy you are the goose that lays the golden egg, you lovable thing you! keep up the good work, of strokes and rudeness. Your my idle, keep on raging. against the machine?
screenjunkies Arlington Road is such an underrated movie. Tim Robbins is absolutely terrifying.

screenjunkies LOVE the red wedding so fing nice
screenjunkies hahah thats what i always do i skip all the plot with bran and his bullshit
screenjunkies All the Stark children are skinchangers, except Lady already died in season 1 and Robb is...well you know.
screenjunkies Best moment: Tyrion drags his chair in the town hall.
screenjunkies Actually Joffrey is a bastard.
screenjunkies Dont watch the coments, they are only spoilers.

screenjunkies Please do the big bang theory
screenjunkies Say KaliMah! KALIMAAAAAAAAAH!Or: This IS THIS
screenjunkies lol its sad iknow all their names
screenjunkies WTF is with these random ass nouns that describe people
screenjunkies I will admit I am not the best one to judge because although i did watch the original cartoon show. I wasnt a fan boy about it but let me express how I feel about a White Shredder.....Sure, shredder is suppose to Asian BUT....Lets face facts when you think of shredder, your not thinking ethnicity, your not thinking of his real name. All your thinking about is that bad ass costume and im sure for when the fight scenes with him happen they will have an actual fighter in the suit doing all the stunts. So lets see how they fill it.
screenjunkies Im sorry but Im getting sick of them making remakes of my childhood favorites with fuxking CGI. If they didnt heavyily use that I would be fine with a remake.
screenjunkies this looks ok... but you cant really judge until you view the whole movie for yourself... its a remake of the whole story of the turtles ... I dont see that as bad just wanting a fresh start on theyre characters .... I want to go see this to judge myself if its good or bad but also I am seeing it as a separate movie from the other turtles movies and series as a lot of the time they dont get it right (examples the last airbender and dragon ball) but other times they have done a good job...
screenjunkies Holy shit. When they started busting out old action figures it brought back some memories. I had every single one of those.
screenjunkies YAAAAAAAAAAAAAY BEBOP AND ROCKSTEADY MIGHT BE IN DA FILM!  FANBOY SCREAM
screenjunkies michael bay can always stick to the original origin story and just mature it up...like the turtles actually cuts and stabs people from the foot clan or any criminals they come across (becoz they are ninjas brah) and beat the shit outta them......I can see like leonardo bashing someones head for information ala batmanthis would fly IMO
screenjunkies Not a bad trailer but not enough to dispose me of my suspicions. Friggin Megan Fox?! Why?!
screenjunkies Payoff honest movie trailers is no longer honest
screenjunkies It might be good but the CGI looks awful, I cant even look at the turtles!
screenjunkies Winter Soldier should be next! doooooooo iiitttttttt
screenjunkies Do Captain America The Winter Soldier  PLZ
screenjunkies 90 yearold Virgin killed me :DDDDD

screenjunkies Do Sons of Anarchy!!!
screenjunkies Ive watched Audition thanks to this video.I...I... just... dont know what to say. All I can do is sink back into my chair and look at the ceiling.
screenjunkies Ive been waiting fo someone to say it but they havent so I shall.Bowling alley scene in Suicide ClubThat movie has soooo many messed up scenes but that one even trumps the Audition scene by far!
screenjunkies In Gozu a man was born.
screenjunkies the one scene in the fly where the chick has the maggot baby
screenjunkies In the Exorcist when Regan is stabbing herself with a crucifix though the scene that most disturbed me was the spider walk down the stairs. Twin Peaks is also way creepy. Bob crawling towards the camera, and pretty much anything in the Black Lodge. (So now Im sitting here alone in my room, thinking about the moments in film that have haunted me most. Awesome.)
screenjunkies How about the scene from Train Spotting where they wake up from a weeks long high and the infant child is showed already decaying in the crib. I immediately was turned off by that movie as being a comedy.I just could not finish watching that movie after that.
screenjunkies The Korean Movie, I Saw the Devil is probably the most disturbing and scariest movie Ive ever watched.
screenjunkies the passion of the Christ , torture scene
screenjunkies The ending to Stephen Kings The Mist.
screenjunkies Mysterious Skin. Its the scene where Neil gets raped...
screenjunkies Well at least he (barely) survives Die Hard 2! lol Who would have thought that a film with special forces and air plane explosions would be the most survivable :D
screenjunkies Honest action fast five!
screenjunkies Do the raid 1 or 2 also honest trailer
screenjunkies Do a Kick Ass honest action
screenjunkies I know its not really an action movie, but please do Passion of the Christ.
screenjunkies its kind of funny hearing the danube waltz in the background
screenjunkies Screen Junkies. Y U NO Mention Postal?
screenjunkies Well, my idea isnt exactly just taking the game and making it into a movie, though the whole Dragonborn storyline in Skyrim alone could have the potential, if done properly, to be good, but rather make a movie about the war that takes place between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion. Because as players, we only know of this event later when playing Skyrim. It completely happens in transition between Oblivion and Skyrim. You could totally take that setting and build a plot from out of that. For instance, make up a movie where the remaining last few members of the Blades find and discover an infant with Talos bloodline aka the future Dragonborn that we play with in the later game and all the struggles they face trying to move the dragonborn infant across Cyrodil, while being pursued by Aldmeri agents, and over the border to safety because as dragon hunters it is their sworn duty to help and protect the dragonborn. With the right casting and the set pieces, you could make a very good last stand movie out of that idea like 300 or 13 assassins. Thats my opinion at least.But besides that, I have a close second... Metal Gear Solid. Though, now that i think about it... those games are already so cinematic. Liveaction adaptations of them sound pointless...
screenjunkies Have they made a movie for Rachet and Clank cz its like an aweskme game series aling with the batman arkham... games
screenjunkies Fallout and Elder Scrolls would be interesting
screenjunkies Wtf are you guys talking about? Silent Hill and Prince of Persia were both CRAP!
screenjunkies 1.HALO 4 (or any other halo game), I want this game to have a movie.I heard the movie may be coming but was blocked by another movie, I think its Elysium or something else, I forgot...2.Bioshock Infinite, damn just think what a bioshock movie would be about?
screenjunkies Instead of making sequels for Star Wars they should had done a movie trilogy based on the Knights of the Old Republic games
screenjunkies I want so see Sam rami direct a borderlands movie
screenjunkies Hey... who would skip Frozen Heart?
screenjunkies You should do Divergent! D
screenjunkies The cold never bothered me anyway
screenjunkies do a honest to smiley
screenjunkies Please do as above so below
screenjunkies The parodied lyrics to Let it Go are so true. Someone needs to make a full cover of that. Holy freakin crap, that song is EVERYWHERE. You cant even say the words let it go in my school anymore without half the class bursting into song. The other day, we got into a debate on responsibilities we have as American citizens, and it ended with the most annoying kid in my class arguing with the teacher about adoption vs. abortion and the rest of us yelling at him to just shut up. I made the mistake of telling him to let it go, and next thing I hear is: LET IT GO! LET IT GO! CANT HOLD IT BACK ANYMOOOOOOREEEEE!!!
screenjunkies staring ryan seacrest.... LMFAO!!

screenjunkies Nick Mundy should host.
screenjunkies I want nick mundy to host the Oscars!
screenjunkies MORE JAPANESE NICHOLAS CAGE!!!
screenjunkies oh Japan, you have everything dont you
screenjunkies George Clooney did the Nespresso commercial for England too. Its really funny. Dont know why he did it.
screenjunkies George Clooney should do an norwegian commercial, oh wait, he already did.
screenjunkies Check out clive owen mexican commercials
screenjunkies You and it should be a movie trailer
screenjunkies Of course, this is in the 80s and 90s when the japanese economic bubble was at its biggest. They must have been paying well over the odds for these celebs to be in their commercials.
screenjunkies Id like to see Tom Hiddleston in America doing me (Im straight but Jesus Christ, Im also kidding)
screenjunkies i just realized something. any scene is intense with nic cage on screen.

screenjunkies Honest trailer for TED please
screenjunkies say swiggity swooty im coming for that booty
screenjunkies What is the music from 2:36?
screenjunkies TOOK ME AN HOUR TO STOP LAUGHING....
screenjunkies I think as a stand alone movie in itself it will be great to watch especially if youre just looking to entertain yourself a 2 hours. Or even if youre not really following the series.It has action, it has comedy, it has a talking racoon, people will see it regardless of being a super hero fan or not. It just looks like fun.That all being said, anyone following the Avengers series will most likely see this movie, and that already has a very large following. This movie just expands it even more. This movie will definitely be a huge success, I really cant wait for it.
screenjunkies The Trailer looks good. Im going to see it.
screenjunkies Its gonna pop my cosmic cherry.
screenjunkies Of course, its going to be great!
screenjunkies NOVA...... Guardians of the Galaxy 2 NEEDS nova
screenjunkies Still hate Bradley cooper as rocket, person that voiced rocket raccoon in umvc3 should have done it.
screenjunkies I think the movie will POP! I think it will be as the video said almost a broadening step to expose more stories and bring it villains and heros and not only that but will bring in stories that can be made into incredible movies
screenjunkies Its ganna kickin like chicken
screenjunkies Almost.... Almost..........Almost.
screenjunkies Say: There will only be 8 planets after I destroy Uranus.
screenjunkies What is Gravity about?
screenjunkies buzz light year was gold! lmao
screenjunkies Its a bored bored bored movies really bored
screenjunkies You guys should do Enders Game.
screenjunkies do team america world police
retrogametech Should should mod it and out some LED lights on it etc...
retrogametech man... you really lucked out on that one!
retrogametech Man, you got lucky with this purchase lol.
retrogametech I want a Vectrexxxxxxxxxxxx !
retrogametech Nice find. Can never quite believe it when eBay sellers cant be bothered to do easy checks on electrical equipment. I bought my Jaguar from someone who assumed it was broken because it didnt light up when you switched it on without a cart in it.
retrogametech Dude, these videos are the best
retrogametech Wicked motherfucker,westside
retrogametech Nice vid man! Keep it up
retrogametech Thanks for posting another video, I truly appreciate your effort.
retrogametech The explosions look kind of like the pulsar map from the golden disc aboard the Voyager Spacecraft.
retrogametech Jealous. I wanted the metal sonic. Brother got some from pound shop. He got warehedghog and sonic
retrogametech These look pretty cool! Might have to take a trip to the local pound stores. I wouldnt mind knuckles. Knuckles is a pimp.
retrogametech What the hell? You jammy git. You only had two  you got both the ones you wanted. Buy a lotto ticket asap.
retrogametech I like those! I only have one Sonic character set and its Big and Froggy! It takes me to Sonic Adventure everytime I look at Big and his pollywog pal hanging out in their carboard Mystic Ruins!! Froggy where are you! Youre looking kinda weird good buddy whats up with the tail? Hey wait a minute you swallowed my lucky charm!!
retrogametech This is odd, but cool at the same time, pretty detailed too.
retrogametech dont stop man  i love your vids  1 fan
retrogametech Love them black GBAs and SPS
retrogametech man, you really hav a lot of gba sps OO :D
retrogametech You have one of the best channels around. Glad to see you are back )
retrogametech Slacker!! Thanks for showing us your big box...
retrogametech Ah dude its good tae see ye back on here :)
retrogametech Hey Martin, Hope all is well man. Happy New Year. Excellent collection there. Awesome! You really know how to take care of your collection. Great stuff..:
retrogametech Yea theres a good chance your comments will be ghosted if your account isnt quality enough. Just posting too much can effectively silent ban you, Im pretty sure this post wont show up.
retrogametech Love your vids and think its great how you share your passion with us and love that you dont sell out as a lot of you tubers do by excepting gifts or try selling shirts ect keep up the good work :)
retrogametech I seriously need to get one of those now.
retrogametech I cant stand a month without your video!
retrogametech Hello. Ive tried to contact you with a request, but i can not untill you add me to contacts. If you are into commission work, please add me to your contacts and we can discuss my request.Thanks and regards,grimm
retrogametech Hello Where do you but the usb flash card ???? i need one where can i buy it !
retrogametech Ive been trying to find one of these for a while, but i dont know what they are called.could you tell me what that blue usb programmer is called
retrogametech Have you tried it in Linux? Its possible Linux might just recognize it as removable storage.
retrogametech Check out GBAtemp.net. Thats where I get all my firmware for my ds flash carts.
retrogametech I picked up an old Atari 400 from an old lady. It doesnt power on and I have tested the PSU to ensure its functioning how can I go about troubleshooting the circuit board? Many thanks.
retrogametech RetroGameTech  Heres the IT Technicians way of locating drivers, seeming I am one myself. :)Go to Run  Type devmgmt.msc  Find the device under the device manager  right click and select properties  Click the Details tab at the top of the window  In the drop down box and select Hardware Ids  The box below will show something like dev0000 ven0000. Once you have the Device and Vendor IDs, head over to http:pcidatabase.com and enter those two numbers into their website and it will tell you exactly what your device is and the website of the manufacturer where you can download drivers from. This may not help you solve your issue, but it may give you a few clues on where to look.By the way, if the hardware id comes up as something like: USBVID177FPID0250, just search those two numbers in Google and that should give you an idea on where to look as well.
retrogametech Hey this is exactly how my atari2600 backup cartridge works. I made a readerwriter that connects to the pc which allows me to save digital copies of all of my 2600 games and then put any game on the battery backed ram cartridge. I was wondering if something similar existed for other systems and you just showed me the gba has such a device made for it. Thanks for sharing!
retrogametech Just google : Ewin Client 0.72 Download , first link.
retrogametech I used to have one of these, but I dont have any of the software. Sorry. It came on a miniCD disc, so maybe the seller might have the disc or something.
retrogametech Check this out http:gbatemp.netthreadssmartcard256mbgbwriter.35407
retrogametech I think the label on Strider II is Korean, but I dont know
retrogametech The writing on the back of the cart is Korean not Chinese
retrogametech thats actually korean
retrogametech So true! It has a lot of amaziong 2D titles. Its library is sort of how I wished video games had progressed after the SNESMD era. Heavy on the 2D pixel art with detailed sprites  environments and smooth animations. But instead we got 3D polygon ugliness on hardware that wasnt quite ready for it.
retrogametech I got that zero mission bootleg too. The seller did not even mention it was fake. If you know what to look for its quite easy to spot a fake though. I am trying to get a complete metroid collection, so Id have to hunt down a real one.
retrogametech Passed me by too. But picked one up from Gamestation for 5 a few years back and Ive been hooked ever since :). Its really surprising to me how broad and massive its library is. Im starting to put together a hidden gems vid highlighting some of the better titles.
retrogametech Ive got quite a few yeah :) . Im hoping to do a full collection vid sometime soon so Ill show them all there.
retrogametech I think the picture in picture was a good idea. Another great video. Thanks for sharing.
retrogametech I wasnt really playing it, just randomly messing about to capture footage for this vid :P
retrogametech Yeah, those are always pretty funny. Ive got a few of them. Some have crazy ROM hacks of NES games on them XD
retrogametech I totally agree! And the games are (mostly) very cheap as a result. :)
retrogametech big mutha truckers seems to run about as good as the real version from videos i seen. it is better then the cruisn exotica on gbc i had.
retrogametech bit delayed but good video mateneed some advice if possible i have few older consoles but connected to new modern tv. no space for old tv whats best i can do with connection?
retrogametech no atari, snes, nes, neogeo. not even a phillips cdi
retrogametech U gotta get the xbox one bf4 its like a new gaming experience I use to play pc game like garrys mod not the best graphics but what. Im sayin is it feels like a pc game
retrogametech Id love to but never had enough money for it. One day! :)
retrogametech Thanks. Glad to someone else feels the same about ME! haha. Im looking forward to playing through Deus Ex :) . No, the 32X I have modded with a 5060Hz switch (probably should have mentioned that in the vid). Its a little complicated to explain but the 32X and Mega Drive need to be set to the same video setting (most of the time). The Mega CD is just stock PAL and plays as you would expect.
retrogametech Why doesnt the 3D adapter work on LCD? I understand the light gun games need a CRT, do the glasses also pick up messages from the screen? Also what was that cart in the Saturn? Is the Xbox one connected by component cables? Do you have any old Nintendo consoles, or do you use the Wiis virtual console for all that? Sorry for all the questions, lol.
retrogametech it looks like you have 2 resident evil Revelations for the 3ds i am jw cause it looked like it in the video
retrogametech Works perfectly for me, yes. I love mine and use them for everything other than listening to music. But shop around and dont pay too much for a set.
retrogametech Nope. Wrong side of the country.
retrogametech Yeah I think Im going to keep it as it is. Its more interesting as a bright pink machine gun, haha. You should totally make a response to Eds vid!
retrogametech A future vid perhaps :)
retrogametech Sounds like an edinburgh accent?????
retrogametech The Dream eye was actually made to do both. Sadly only two games supported it with other planned ones, but it came out at the end of the dreamcast life cycle.
retrogametech Same here. I watched the Wild Ambition review before deciding whether or not to buy :P
retrogametech Love seeing these old rare hardware!
retrogametech I had a HNG64 and Sam Sho 64, I gave it to a friend for free because its huge, heavy and a piece of crap (and I love SNK). Roads Edge is a cool game though, but you need a driving cabinet for it. I played it at the King Dome before it was demolished.
retrogametech I was offered a deal with a number of games for a very cheap price..... I decided to pass as it would just end up another box in the corner. :D
retrogametech tempting but i barely have room for what i have xD recently got a dreamcast and its budged next to my nes and xbox 360 xD gotta n64 sat on a cardbored box and a ps2 and a ps3 super slim on a shelf thingy above the nes dc and xbox would like to get one but i have no room  oh and my mega drive is sat on my nes... now where the heck do i put my snes... CURSE YOU LIMITED SPACE!!!
retrogametech Generally its not the hardware that differs from one region to another but the BIOS. The games might also have some regional differences but that is usually set by the BIOS. And normally you can pick and choose your settings from the BIOS menus. But Im speaking generally here. Im only familiar with SNK hardware.
retrogametech In MAME still dont have sound, but i finish this game and i defeat the boss. That multigames someway must be dumped.
retrogametech Haha, theyre practically bullet proof! Total overkill on the shielding. But those carts with the embossed SNK logo do look awesome! :) Btw great to see T3T back again! Didnt have time to make a response but 2 of your choices were identical to mine anyway! haha. And not that it matters now but Heavenly Sword on PS3 would be my third choice.
retrogametech My left bumper is a bit sticky but thats what makes it so fun
retrogametech If the seller watched this video, they must be really feelin like a numpty.
retrogametech I cant remember the exact size but its a Torx security bit. Just search ebay for xbox 360 controller tool or similar.
retrogametech And of course, dont use anything too harsh as a detergent.
retrogametech One dislike... The seller must have seen this video.
retrogametech at least it wasnt expensive,works good
retrogametech It was not my CM, a friends let fall a bottle on the computer and i told him that i was able to repair it.
retrogametech The xbox 360 controller is very well designed but internally is a mess. The bumpers are weakly designed. The triggers may scratch the case in some cases, the analog sticks on the silver controllers scratch the internal paint and they arent smooth anymore due the friction with the border, the headphone jack may stop letting you use the headset due some internal misconnection and my battery pack isnt properly charged by any of my controllers, I use an external charger to refresh my batteries.
retrogametech hmm, maybe buy clones so i can have a reason to amass tons of older games then slowly replace fakes with real systems... with real maintenance :L
retrogametech The wireless pads were from eBay a few months back. Got them cheapfaulty and repaired them. They seem to work with everything :)
retrogametech Not that youd want to, but thatd be easily made into a portable
retrogametech Me thinks it might need a weight in there XD
retrogametech Ive been keeping an eye open for one of those things. Theyre very rare nowadays and pretty expensive when they show up on ebay. Cool thing to have though!
retrogametech Always interesting to see clones.
retrogametech please watch my rare console i found on dumpster. btw good video review
retrogametech Great video!,) In 1993 most Lithuanian gamers was never seen a original console. Now I collecting all these stuff.
retrogametech Thanks, dude. Good to see youre still active here on YouTube :)
retrogametech What is your eBay account?
retrogametech why do you have 2 copy of  Resident Evil Revelations  are they different ?
retrogametech Ahh, that makes sense. I never even thought about the schools being out for summer. Btw, been really enjoying the NerdMasters vids. Keep those coming! :)
retrogametech Well done grabbing the Sky box, the 500GB HDD alone was worth your effort. Im surprised Sky didnt take that with them if they were upgrading the neighbours sky box. Yeah I was a Sonic kid, Master System II was my first console, I never had much interest in Mario titles until Super Mario 64. Even then that was years after the N64 release, I picked system up used with Ocarina of Time, Goldeneye, Mario 64 I think for only 25 in a CashConverters (in 2000 or 2001) :)
retrogametech Your videos are great :)
retrogametech Have to ask, what make soldering iron do you use?
retrogametech the PAL games look alot different, may look fake, but they arent
retrogametech Sometimes its good to have a break. Im on hiatus at the mo.
retrogametech Yo, score on that hard drive!
retrogametech Did you check if that hdd is still in warranty? you could rma it fro a brand new one. Doubt it is though since it was bought by another company.
retrogametech you like the sims you sad bastard
retrogametech Already sold by the time the vid went live, sorry.
retrogametech Whatever I find cheap :)
retrogametech If you ever find an NTSC copy let me know! :)
retrogametech Martin, Id love to see your retro PC game collection and what sort of system you use to play old games with. Also would like to see the pictures you pulled off the GB Camera (if theyre not personal).
retrogametech Thanks! I appreciate the nice comment :)
retrogametech Ive always wanted a pokemon mini!
retrogametech Also is it time for your 2013 entertainment setup video now hint hint lol
retrogametech I have to get some of these for myself! I hope I can find some that work too. . (and find money to buy them as well)
retrogametech My friend has a backlit AGS 101. It also has the AUS code.
retrogametech Looks no different than the Silver one I had, just as painful to use too lol.
retrogametech FYI, there was also an Asian version for sale in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.
retrogametech Lol I have one of these.
retrogametech I have the axact same AUS model. Its the graphite color one with an EU charger lol. Bought from a guy from Singapore who bought it from ToysRuS back in 2005. :D
retrogametech Enjoying watching these repair videos. I know you say you go to ebay to buy your broken console but have you even been to a Cash generator shop to buy their spare parts section items?
retrogametech This video is painful to watch. I was the other guy bidding on them, and the app on my phone decided not to tell me I was outbid.
retrogametech hey what kind of tv are you using to play those games? looks like an lcd
retrogametech Out of curiosity have you considered doing modsrepairs for other people? I know theres a few people who already do that professionally but usually ridiculously overpriced for the work involved for some things.
retrogametech I suppose one way to look at it is you will have a spares board full of working parts ifwhen you repair more of them.
retrogametech Maybe, 90 to send it out to the guy in the UK, so I still need to think it over.
retrogametech Wow, I didnt know about this! Thanks!
retrogametech Nice one I didnt know about this at all! Ill need to go back and try all my VC games :)
retrogametech just got a 3ds and downloaded Shantae its an amazing game. have you tried the game gear ports on the system they have that option in the menu for screen resolution.
retrogametech hey, i can guess you backed the new gen of Shantae on Kickstarter, what level do you have? as in which level did you back as well, and what do you think of the redesign for that said game for Shantae?
retrogametech I always enjoy watching your videos. I always learn new stuff about game consoles.
retrogametech I have demo this before as well and it is nice
retrogametech Excellent info! The blurred default setting also bothers me its great to know that theres this pixel perfect resolution that allows GBGBC games to look as they were originally. Thanks!
retrogametech I appreciate the support! :)
retrogametech Am I the only one who can hear that loud squealing? Sounds like a CRT going bad. Maybe Im just sensitive to the high pitched noise in my old age, but it made the video unwatchable. No thumbs down, though, probably just myself hearing it.
retrogametech Exactly my thoughts! lol.
retrogametech Haha, not at all. :) I just find it interesting that you and a couple other viewers were able to hear something I wasnt even aware of. I must be getting old! :P Thanks for watching and taking the time to comment. I really appreciate it.
retrogametech I agree. Its looking like the Scorpions CPU clock is slightly mismatched with what the 32X can reliable work with. Ive seen someone else get it to work but have no details on how. Id guess the oscillator needs switched.
retrogametech love watching your videos have you got any videos or know how to get a ps2 net work adapter mod i dont want to pay 30 for a real network adapter lol is there such a mod?
retrogametech I dont have one but I dont think it would make a difference. Ive tested games from all regions and get the same synctiming issues.
retrogametech sorry if i offended you, it wasnt meant to come across like that, the noise wasnt annoying it just caught my attention, at first i thought it was my headphones or the connection between the headphones and the computer. which is why i asked, loving your vids man and keep up the good work!!! :) again, sorry for the over exaggeration :)
retrogametech Cheers Jeff! Good to see you back on YT!
retrogametech but when blend hend blend why can make sega dreamblend 2! ur hend hand blend smaller cause if u cant make blend sega cd blender just rewand ur games from toaster scrambled blended eggs
retrogametech Youve been watching Metal Jesus hidden gems video.
retrogametech Just to mention few: De Blob 2, Nights journey into dreams,Onechanbara,Okami,Project Zero2,Sin and Punishment,sonic sega allstars racing,Western Heroes. the Crash games are good ports too. So many to list :) I also quite like all the hunting games. Works really well with the wiimote controls. Just need to buy one of those gun holders.
retrogametech Had my Wii since its launch and have always struggled to find games for it. At any one time Ive only had up to 10 games for it, and currently have 5 games including Twilight Princess, Super Mario Galaxy (which if Im honest I became bored with quickly) Wii Sports and the two Pikmin Gamecube ports. Ill have to have a look around and see if I can find some cheap games to expand on my modest game library.
retrogametech I didnt care much for dead space on the Wii. It was alright.
retrogametech Ive played it but like I mentioned Im really not into Mario. I know theyre well made games but they hold no nostalgia for me and I actually really dislike the art style. Dont ask why, the wee guy just irritates me, haha.
retrogametech would you be up for doing a swap for EPIC MICKEY 3 AND BLOB FOR EITHER HALO 4 OR GOLDEN AXE 2 AND SONIC 1 UNBOXED
retrogametech Any cheap 30W iron with a fine tip from ebay gets most jobs done.
retrogametech Zak and Wiki is a must buy for the Wii. Also Spectrobes: Origins is pretty good. House of the Dead: Overkill is funny as hell. And that is pretty much all the Wii I own.
retrogametech That sound really interesting. Ill go watch some vids on it. Cheers!
retrogametech Ive had one of these for a long time and the box and everything, its pretty cool and especially the retro menus.
retrogametech Question: What is with the Moonshell folder on the SD card? Was that just left over from a flash cart, or does this thing actually use Moonshell? Surely I wouldnt think it would, but it wouldnt completely surprise me.
retrogametech Did you test it out on a DSDS Lite at all? Im curious as to how the layout changes when you switch from a GBA to a DS
retrogametech Funny enough I did mention to my friend about this when I was in. So instead of going home with some gaming goodies my son got his wish for Minecraft junk instead lol
retrogametech The AES repair? Ill be doing a followup on that in the next couple of weeks :)
retrogametech Cool piece of tech, maybe a bit pointless.
retrogametech Telecom Power Glove is the band
retrogametech Its just the same SD card I use in my DS R4 )
retrogametech I didnt actually look that close, but Ill have to check the next time Im there.
retrogametech I like the music. specially the main riff beginning
retrogametech I think the controllers are just generic. Ive seen loads of them in the past. They are really bad! haha
retrogametech Supercool looking! Has a nice formshape. Thanks for the share :)
retrogametech Haha, I doubt youd see anyone get away with that nowadays!
retrogametech The sega 32X compatibility fix with this clone has been done, can be seen here: vKbW2pN6mk
retrogametech Wow, that was an amazing break down that machine. I seem to recall Scorpion being a name in the Clone machines from that time period. I recall seeing a black Famicom looking device earlier in the year, also bearing the name Scorpion.
retrogametech That is amazing! I cant believe you found one and gave us such an up close view of it!! I remember watching the episode and being fascinated by the machine when I was maybe 7 or 8!! It couldnt have found a better owner! I bet it has another 20 years in it!
retrogametech I certainly hope Sega hired the guys who bootlegged this.
retrogametech Still got mine and it still works fine (though using a replacement PSU). (Mines a Scorpion XVI by the way)
retrogametech Love these videos mate, my favourite YouTube channel by a mile. Please keep them coming.
retrogametech Hey mate ever find a cheap one pm me i would like to get one of these.
retrogametech hey martin i am trying to message you but it wont let me as you need to have me as a contact apparently now. i have added you to my address book. cheers
retrogametech What a bargain! 2 almost (and now fully) working AES for that price is awesome!
retrogametech Thanks :). Ill drop you a PM when I get round to selling them :)
retrogametech excellent vid, subscribed! miss my neo geo
retrogametech Sorry, recently Ive been getting loads of people PMing me with technical queries looking for help. As a result I sadly had to disable PMs altogether on my account. Therere literally not enough hours in the day for me to sit down, read, work out a solution then write out a detailed response to everyones questions. I tried to in the past but many people were either outright rude to me or didnt even say thanks. Its nothing personal. Keeping up with video comments is hard enough! :P
retrogametech I see the post is everywhere the same.
retrogametech The wires are a lot tidier than mine.
retrogametech I wish our TVs had SCART inputs :( 2:07
retrogametech As far as Emulation is there a big difference between the SLG and the emulation scan line filter?
retrogametech Very brave moving that unit!! Cable hell. Tried this set up mate, tho it was ok, Ive since brought a crt tv for my wii. Far better results for me and cheaper than all scalers etc.
retrogametech I dont really plan my vids, just make them as I feel like it :). You should totally do a tour! Its always cool to see other peoples setups. Thanks for taking the time to watch and comment :)
retrogametech That 60Hz must be wonderful to have! I could never stand playing things in 50Hz.
retrogametech whats usb media box do you use and would you recommend it
retrogametech I love that Outrun Remix. What is it called?
retrogametech could you fix my 360 for me? it red ring on me and i dont wanna deal with ms again
retrogametech Liking the scan lines! Looks great on 2D games, how does it look for 3D ones? Kind of interested in this now.
retrogametech Thanks, I appreciate the nice feedback! There are plenty of other YouTubers with content well worth a watch. Got a few listed on my main page channels list :)
retrogametech Three things mate: (If you dont mind!) 1. What is the difference of PAL cases? Never noticed! 2. If you still have a love for GBA  Micros, check out Rose Colored Gaming (Best to google it.) They do faceplates, which you might like. 3. Fantastic videos as always, and great finds! :) Seth
retrogametech Looks great on everything I tried :) Even 3D onrails shooters look much better!
retrogametech we have the same tv stand
retrogametech ahh i loved world of goo. very good ending.
retrogametech It works surprisingly well with the Wii. You should definitely check it out. :) DIY scanline generator?, sounds cool! What tut did you follow?
retrogametech Reasons why I play the Wii on a CRT :D. I just bought a Wii. A lot of Cheap games. Picked up Zelda: Skyward sword for 19AU, metroid for 15AU and a couple of others for 4AU
retrogametech DS cases? DS PAL cases are white plastic, much thicker, have no spine art and normally just plain title text. Theyre very bland looking. Thanks for the tip and thanks for watching :)
retrogametech Your a very clever man and I respect that. Good job.
retrogametech So good to see, that theese good old consoles are getting this good treatment. I doubt, somebody in 20 years or so, will be fixing Xbox or PS3 as efficiently, as this.
retrogametech skills mandid you learn circuitry etc at college?...
retrogametech I sent you a personal message retrogametech pls read it. Thanks
retrogametech jesus that conversion mod hackjob looked nasty! ive never seen a solder point that bad, even when i started out and thats sad lol
retrogametech Haha, not quite, but thanks! :)
retrogametech OMG!! cant believe you have rescued this Martin, thank you so much for your time and skill, EPIC!!
retrogametech Hey Rtg fancy having a look at my Famicom? I live in Glasgow to and will pay for it of course
retrogametech Great video man and a great repair from a fellow Scot. Really been enjoying your stuff. If you dont mind me asking, where did you learn your electronic wizardry?
retrogametech I have one, got it from JammaNationX, for cheap too and works great, they deep clean and test everything, but if I ever have a problem I know where to go now :)
retrogametech Ahhh.. I see what you did there! Yes it is indeed a joy to use. If only the Mega Drive had had something like this! Better yet, get rid of that crappy dpad on the 360 controller and replace it with one like this! :)
retrogametech Breakers. Its a very basic but fun fighter :)
retrogametech Its definitely one of the best! :)
retrogametech Thanks. Theres a mod to do something similar to this but its a lot of work and Id imagine youd lose that original feel.
retrogametech Theres plenty! I just dont make vids about it! :P
retrogametech I dont think u could ever find deals like that here in the states. Too bad.
retrogametech Its amazing what can be fixed if you just know how. Thanks for another great video as always.
retrogametech I checked this game out cuz of this vid and omg its amazing! As an 80s kid I thoroughly enjoyed it so thanks dude. Also good job on the case cover...very convincing :)
retrogametech Sounds like your friend is mixin up far cry 3 and blood dragon. Far cry 3 youre surviving on island and in blood dragon youre on intentionally stupid techno island. In my opinion its the best shooter ive played for time. I recommend it for eightiesearly ninities or before born ppl just so youll get the idea.
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Im a noob at photoshop so I found it fun and frustrating all at the same time :P.
retrogametech Haha, I think a ROM hack is in order :P
retrogametech nice job ! i dl the game today on psn ,i hope i enjoy it
retrogametech Haha, they should release it in the style of an old game like this or maybe in a VHS box. Its a great game :)
retrogametech What do you have in front of the Mega Drive? at 6:30 (in the bottom, a semicircle that says SEGA) where it should have the cable cords for the controllers? Or Genesis had a Wireless version?How do you modded it for having PAL  NTSC? I want to do it with mine (and all my consoles but SNES and NES because I like the look of both... And TurboGrafxPCEngine)
retrogametech great review man, never saw this. I knew the DC had the first one built in and I knew about xband and the famicon one with the lottery ticket fiasco too LOL. but this is just great!
retrogametech That is extremely cool! I wish it had made its way to the U.S.
retrogametech that is so fucking cool that it still works.
retrogametech Thanks for watching. Glad you found it interesting :)
retrogametech I wish Sega was still in the console business.
retrogametech PlayStation 2 is the reason why SEGA faild
retrogametech Didnt the modem have the sonic Eraser?
retrogametech How do you know we arent already? Maybe right now youre actually playing a Dreamcast 2 game! )
retrogametech Awsome..i have been wanting too see you show this since your first video. This was even better than I anticipated thank you so much Bro.And keep up the great  interesting videos!
retrogametech I see less and less of them already. Ebay used to be flooded with nice CRTs but not so much these days. Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Theres only a few reasons to be jealous of European gamers over US, like Shenmue 2, but SCART Tvs has to be the 1 reason, you guys have had quality RGB gaming for decades! I have a Sony PVM with RGB and a scartPVM adapter, Im never giving it up. :D
retrogametech Haha, perfect size to stash away in a cupboard when I need the space. Although it looks so good I now dont want to do that! :) Thanks for the tip. I wasnt sure at the time and didnt want to risk it. Ill remember that for future. I was thinking the TV was maybe upscaling the image or something? I thought theyd be a lot more predominant by default like with my other Trinitron. It looks beautiful all the same :)
retrogametech I gotta Sony PVM, Phillips CM8833 II, Phillips CM8833 mk1  the same Sony Telly as yours. Just cannot decide which one I prefer ahhhhhhhh
retrogametech It would be awesome if you got that thing mounted on your wall
retrogametech I wish we stayed on CRT instead of LCDs, we could have a light weight flat CRT tvs and monitors.
retrogametech I dont imagine I will be. If it looks even half as good as what you showed Ill be amazed :)
retrogametech Dont forget that the standard PAL resolution(576p576i) and framerate(25 FPS) is slightly higher than the standard NTSC resolution(480p480i) and framerate(24 FPS).
retrogametech I love this sort of dedication. And I never knew how much I needed scanlines in my life. Wonderful!
retrogametech A device dedicated to black lines is silly !
retrogametech I just use my old TV for my retro gaming D
retrogametech Im Lazy And UnSkilled, I Might Try One For The WiiGamecube If I Can Figure it Out. (I Was Thinking It Was Those Horizontal lines That Travel Up Or Down The TV) I Put My Piece Of Shit Laptop Out Of Commission, Gonna Spend My Next Paycheck getting My Trusty Ol PC Working.... Yet Again.
retrogametech In the not too distant future sourcing good quality, working, CRTs is going to get pretty challenging. Ive noticed it becoming much less common to find them discarded at the side of the road or cheap on ebay. It seems like many of them have already found their way to landfill.
retrogametech Sounds cool. On some consoles and games I like the clean blocky look better. On others I prefer the scanlines. Its all down to personal preference I suppose. Its nice to have the option though :)
retrogametech Very nice explanation of what is now a legendary retro device. :) Its probably worth underlining that this device is best suited to games that were natively designed for 240p output, which is predominantly 2D stuff. Most 3D (480i and 480p) video is best displayed at either 480i or 480p. Proper hires stuff (480p) shouldnt really have scanlines, but some people may prefer this effect. Personally I try to recreate the original look.
retrogametech Itll definitely help but the DC is well known for having a very distinct sounding and noisy drive regardless. I use a good quality bike grease on mine. But any light mechanical grease is fine :) . Just dont use too much :P
retrogametech Great video! I like how you show everything closeup and demonstrate the results handson.
retrogametech So...what happens if another retro enthusiast has a modem? Could you theoretically have a peer to peer game if someone else had the working hardware?
retrogametech Mega Modem i remember seeing this on the back of the box from my Jap genesis The Mega Drive looks hideous with all that shit plugged into it though lol
retrogametech pretty crazy, huh? :)
retrogametech What does it do if pick up?
retrogametech Maybe. Worth a try. But at a guess (although I have never opened one so I cannot know) I think the megadrive modem would likely have some sort of pain in the arse sega only ROM telling it to take over part of the functionality that would normally be written into a game (like would be written into a PC game). However, after that, in the modem, I bet thered be some standard modem chipset, at which point youd solder in a cable. And then emulate the modem with your pc. In fact, either way do that.
retrogametech That would be awesome. There can only be a few titles that are compatable with the MD modem though. I dont know.
retrogametech I was going to get one for one of my Mega Drives, just because its a neat lil thing to have. Your Mega Drive needs more addons... like a built in microwave :O
retrogametech Now you just need the karaoke add on. :)
retrogametech Haha that is absolutely amazing!!!
retrogametech Yeah you guys dont classify it as having even snowed unless its several feet deep! :P
retrogametech Thats the nice thing about rural roads, no traffic! :)
retrogametech I really enjoy these videos of yours. What mount do you use for the Flip cam, and would you recommend it?
retrogametech Nice, Looked a bit faster than the National speed limit.
retrogametech Sod getting in a car with you, I dont like being on that road when its dry and sunny!!
retrogametech Someone should edit it with a Out Run hud and sounds. we need Checkpoints!!111 ,)
retrogametech Great vid! Here in Toronto, just when we thought winter was over we got a few centimeters of snow.
retrogametech Misses the Ferrari car sound to add more excitement :)
retrogametech And it does not even turn on is it just the ribbon cables and am I just being a complete fucking moron
retrogametech XD THANKS FOR TELLING ME U ROCK but I cant take it apart! (
retrogametech i have a canon ixus 220 hs, i bought it for either 150 or 250 but i was shooting an outdoor scene i tripped and fell on the grass and the lens is bent, ill sell it to you if you want. it has a great slow motion feature. used it goes for around 80  90 so if you do get it itd be a great deal on your part. interested?
retrogametech Thats a pretty nice profit! Good find :)
retrogametech where did you learn how to repair stuff?
retrogametech Excellent easy repair! I bet it took a while to diagnose it though.
retrogametech Need urgent answer! If you encounter a stripped screw of these size how would you go about removing them, the previous owner of mine did a number on them and have the exact problem as you with the 3ds
retrogametech 01:00 Looks like you got an extra 1x Styles with your purchase too! What a nice guy!
retrogametech Whats the name of that green layer you use on your desk?
retrogametech i have a ngage bag that i got in 2005 :D, i still got my ngage i love that phone its a beast!
retrogametech 2:22  10:17 Youve been recording it for 12 days?
retrogametech That NGage countdown timer is a very strange item to own indeed. Where did you get that from?
retrogametech Very nice milestone  I am missing 7 ( Atari 1  2  civilization  High seize  warhammer  rifts and of course sega rally, I remember when this one was 20 pounds  delivery from AUS but I said pass, now I am regretting it a little)
retrogametech wow never knew xanadu next was released, from what it looked like it felt like a beta version
retrogametech Do you know how to use Gentoo? I am going crazy.
retrogametech search images ngage qd accessories in google and you will see the dual slot.. theres alot of rare ones like the speaker and the wired headset..
retrogametech congrats mate, your vids are great :)
retrogametech A complete NGage collection!!! Its awesome!!! Congratulations! Now you can start reviewing some of this games, maybe foucusing on the exclusives. I played some of the early games like Tomb Raider (great port), Sonic N (an poor port of Sonic Advance) and Super Monkey Ball (another poor port from the GBA) but I never manage to play the exclusives :(
retrogametech I know this is asking a lot but can you do a really quick vid so I know what I need to do to the bumpers
retrogametech Definitely invest in a wired controler but you CAN clean out the dried battery acid if youre careful and do it right.
retrogametech thanks for making this vid. i just fixed my dpad :D
retrogametech Does anyone know what kind of thumb sticks the Halo 4 controller has? Im looking for them in red. I prefer it better than the original thumb sticks. Help please!! D:
retrogametech Online from GAME. Amazon sell them as well from what I can see.
retrogametech Thanks. Good to hear you got it running again but just remember thats an extremely temporary fix :P
retrogametech The Dreamcast was WAY ahead of its time. Still looking great, well into the new millennium.
retrogametech Thanks Luke! Thats what I was aiming for so Im glad the vid came across in that way and you enjoyed it :) . Haha, I was genuinely surprised Tengu didnt put up more of a fight! Usually he hands me my ass a good 4 or 5 times before I finally beat the game. I think I got lucky! haha Thanks for watching!
retrogametech Always been more of a Tekken fan myself, although I do enjoy a bit of DOA. Never really enjoyed the Street Fighter series
retrogametech How about Tekken series? Especially third (my favourite) on PlayStation? I never played DoA, I think i must test it out on my PSOne.
retrogametech wtf? they graphics are cracking for a 90s console why do i not remember them as this?
retrogametech congratulations on your 200th video!
retrogametech ive never played any of the dead or alive games
retrogametech Oh my god, Martin I live in strathaven and go to holy cross , just around the corner from bm and sainsburys ( where he started off :D
retrogametech I can watch that kind of thing till the cows come home :)
retrogametech looks wierd to see places youve seen on a video haha :D
retrogametech Most Corsa drivers do :P
retrogametech Haha, I used to love watching that show.
retrogametech Thanks. Ive actually been watching a few Swedish YouTubers do driving vids recently. Looks like a beautiful country! Id love to visit some day.
retrogametech MARTIN DO U LIVE IN STRATHAVEN !!!!!!!!!!!
retrogametech Could I do something like this with the original GameBoy Advance? I like the way the original feels in my hands, but there is no version of it with a light built in.
retrogametech Search YT for game gear ds backlight P
retrogametech How much does it affects the battery life?
retrogametech Id rather desolder the cables, less of a danger to destroy such a nostalgic thing.
retrogametech I want to backlight a GB Pocket.
retrogametech i dont know too much about electronics but there are any other two points to solder the cables? ive already done one DMG with this method but those two soldering points are annoying.
retrogametech I remember having to give up on my Game Boy because it started losing vertical lines down the sides. I wonder where it went to as thats probably easily fixable these days.
retrogametech Well this next on the list once Im modding my gbc.
retrogametech Ah, i thought the thing was so bright it over powered the screen so it was hard to see. I have seen a few other videos where the guy used a green light, or maybe it was a film, which looked alot better than the blue. Ill take a look at the twitter pic, whats your twitter name?
retrogametech Thanks. I think Ill try it on a blue and classic white VMU next. I do like the transparent green, though :)
retrogametech I actually did a video about that a while back :P
retrogametech The battery life was never great but personally it doesnt affect me. I never use my VMUs away from the console so most of them have just had their batteries removed.
retrogametech the best light to use for a gameboy color, is the frontlight from a GBA SP
retrogametech If only I had a dreamcast... I mean, this mod is really, really good!
retrogametech so how many min the batteries last? :p
retrogametech Lol, so true! :P . Now I get to create a rechargeable VMU hack xD
retrogametech Thats really cool. Shame those batteries were such a pain. Id also like to thank you for the Sega Microsoft controller evo vid. Im very fond of the Dreamcast pad, and your observations on the subsequent Xbox controllers make an interesting point. I did find it interesting that they put a screen on the WiiU. It looks a bit like a tribute to the old VMU screens on your controller.
retrogametech Lol a PC Engine with BSoD. Cool video. Love seeing these obscure old machines. I have a megadrive. Got it for 15 pounds at some game shop in town. Works fine. It was just a bit dirty. Only game I have is Sonic 2. My mum had an atari. Shame she doesnt have it anymore.
retrogametech ic102 has been replaced and the QFP with the mod lead coming off it is the original and is machine placed, the chip with gull wing leads are deffo try joints and should be reflowd. best bet is using a flux pen on the leads and using a hot air pencil to go over the joints, good work on bringing it back to life! :)
retrogametech I was amazed by the quality of the console and packaging. I was about four or five when I got my first console, a NES, so there was no danger of me keeping it all in good nick but I had an older relative who kept his impecable. It makes me think that I had the right idea all along, after all two decades worth of pristine conditioning is great for the buyer buy only equates to around a tenner for the seller. I suppose its more a lifestyle thing but it made me feel better about my habits anyway.
retrogametech Martin, you should put ads on your videos, I feel bad watching them without giving you anything in return. Also the money generated from the ads could help let you buy more junk to repair which would in turn give us more videos :D:D:D like so he can see guys!
retrogametech Thats cool that you got a fair price and was able to fix it up. I think its interesting to see the inside of a video game console. That I wouldnt have the patience to fix them like you have. XD
retrogametech Thanks! Luckily it was a pretty simple fix :)
retrogametech They seem to cost about 70 including postage for BNIB new old stock bundle. So not a bad saving! :)
retrogametech It would be nice to get an original Japanese PCEngine one day :) . They are very expensive though! Its no surprise we get the ugly cover art as usual, haha. JAMMA PCEngine? That sounds interesting!
retrogametech what exactly makes a cartridge a bootleg copy? is it the same rom copied to a different (illegal produced and distributed) cartridge??? ....i.e. does it have the same SNK logo ingame or anything?
retrogametech How do you bootleg MVS carts?
retrogametech This clamshell type case was also used for official PS1 rental versions and some PS1 promos. I really would have wished that most dreamcast games whould have come in these cases instead of those stupid plastic cases, that are so fragile and really difficult to replace as there are almost no repro versions made for them.
retrogametech Nice fabric cutting board lol
retrogametech Haha, I dont play it much. I use it for some arcade ports and thats about it. The Saturn was from that nasty polygon era between 2D 16bit and proper 3D Dreamcast :P .
retrogametech Maybe not nowadays but back in the 90s when these carts could cost an arcade operator 1000s, Im sure a little soldering was well worth the payoff to the pirates.
retrogametech Oh and as an offtopic question: Ive ordered a Japanese Mega Drive model 1 just yesterday and while Im waiting for it I started wondering whether a European AC adaptor would fit it or should I use some sort of power convertor?
retrogametech Nice pick ups, something about cartridge games that makes them special. Love metal slug its a great game, the saturn version plays great.
retrogametech How do you flash a rom onto a chip
retrogametech hi I wonder if you have tried using a sd card entry in cartridge game boy color
retrogametech OH! Those look like the tubs from Morrisons!
retrogametech How do you know all this stuff dude?
retrogametech If your ultimate plan is to make that game look like a normal cartridge, then I want to see the finished product. Never stop doing what you do. I believe you could work for Nintendo.
retrogametech ive been thinking about doing this myself, but with nes and mega drive games. seems to get complicated with the nes carts, being you have to find donor carts. if you start doing more repos id definitely like to see vid on them! )
retrogametech Nice to hear from you again. Very cool project.
retrogametech Thanks dude! Sockets are usually sold in large quantities and work out to be pennies each. But, you should only need one for your test cart. For the actual repro carts the chips will be soldered direct to the PCB and hidden from view :) . Chip prices vary depending on order quantity. Generally each 4Mbit chip will cost 11.50. Overall its quite affordable :) . But soldering all those tiny wires cost me a LOT of time!! :P Lol, baby steps!
retrogametech What if you put a gba rom on it? would the gba be able to play it?
retrogametech Thats really cool. I just want to know how I can get the yellow color out of my game boy case
retrogametech could you maybe fix my snes mini. it wont power up
retrogametech Do gameboy colour games even work in gameboy.i think they do because there exactly the same as gameboy games just when you put them in a gameboy colour they work in couloir not just black and white
retrogametech how long did all this take ?
retrogametech pretty common knowledge with engineers and hobbyists. :)
retrogametech hi do u know ware thre is anay Retro shop in scotland asz i am from glasgow thanks what i gret video
retrogametech heard of Gameboy DMG power adapter? micro USB 2 DMG power
retrogametech Whats the problem? It might be a problem with your console.
retrogametech In all actuality, horizontal bars are very troublesome. There is a second ribbon cable underneath the screen which deals with horizontal lines. That, unfortunately is un fixable. I would consider either buying a new one or roughing it with your old one.
retrogametech IRN BRU! Soooo goood!!
retrogametech Ill give it a shot bro. Thanks a lot for the greetings, I wish you a happy time around the new year as well man
retrogametech Awesome gift. Happy Holidays Luke.
retrogametech I have never tried haggis and dont plan to! The only time really I really know that people eat it is St. Andrews Day (which is November 30th) but nobody I know celebrates it although when I was a Scout they did a little thing every year. Its really not too popular to be honest...
retrogametech WAIT A MINUTE! Scotland??? Arent you from New Zealand?
retrogametech lmao, haha, my old mailman used to do the same thing but that is some funny stuff bro. thanks.
retrogametech for sure bro, for sure. I still have one more package that hasnt been opened yet. I hope the YTuber I sent it to opens it up soon :)
retrogametech I laminated the sides, but havent processed the video yet. Havent gotten much else done due to Christmas and all. My family decided to do handmade gifts this year, so extra time is needed to make those. :( Hehe.
retrogametech Ah man I wish I saw some irn bru in Germany while living there. Sounds good from what I found out so far.
retrogametech Those are some cool gifts! I want to send some nice stuff from my place too, Luke. I didnt forget about the X68000 I promised you )
retrogametech Damn! What about adults who go bed early!?!?
retrogametech I think this is stupid, but I hope they remove the restrictions in other EU countries besides Germany.
retrogametech I think its ridiculous because whats stopping kids staying up till 11 and watching it any way... its just an annoyance for the rest of us.
retrogametech PS try googling for a proxy for 3ds or wii u to connect to USJPAU servers
retrogametech Nintendo... Please remove thy collective heads from thy collective asses. People who grew up in the 80s with the NES, HAVE KIDS NOW!!!! We are old enough to take care of ourselves and this parental restrictive bullshit just insults us for being die hard Nintendo fans.
retrogametech As soon as it starts damaging their profits, theyll soon stop. Just like their no blood policies in the 90s
retrogametech I would have prefer Constructive Criticism.
retrogametech This would impact sales quite a bit. Its not just viewing content its buying new content as well.
retrogametech What if you change the system clock time to a time where its unrestricted?
retrogametech Lol yeah. I see a lot on ebay, but Im thinking most might be fake or the older backlit model. Thanks.
retrogametech Hey can u make a video on how not to get ripped off on ebay,craigslist etc when buying games
retrogametech Lol GBA Games from my College Days :)
retrogametech I have a AGS 101. They are very comon in Denmark actualy. Got mine for around 10 pund with 3 games. One of them was supar mario 3 advance thingy
retrogametech Interesting video video all around.
retrogametech Ah you got the other one of the two on ebay I got the first one with the Z80 glitch
retrogametech Ive done a couple in the past. One of my first vids was a review of it and then one Halloween I did a tag response where I played House Of The Dead using it :P
retrogametech Ahhh, finally someone else who appreciates RGB SCART. I cant even bear looking at MegaDrive images in lower quality anymore, its just so crisp. I was wondering, do you have a video tutorial on modding an N64 for RGB SCART? Also, do you have any videos on repairing Game Gears? Your rambling is enjoyable to listen to for some reason.
retrogametech Please do this to my mega drive :)
retrogametech Lol, I appreciate the concern but it was below zero outside and bollock freezing in the room when I shot this. Sitting on the floor at an awkward angle to the camera probably didnt help matters either :P
retrogametech i was gonna buy the 3rd model....
retrogametech Love the switches  you may start a trend
retrogametech Overclocking only messes things up if its done to an extreme degree. If youre just overclocking a 7MHz processor for a Mega Drive to think its a 10MHz processor, all it would really do is prevent lag in some games.
retrogametech or i could buy 1 send to you and pay for conversion and postage how that be:)
retrogametech As a fellow Scot I have to say his accent is pretty mild and to me he speaks clearly, get your ears tested :)
retrogametech You inspire me to buy soldering irons and dremels. Have you ever seen the wireless irons?
retrogametech Have you seen the single switch jap eng  5060hz mod? Ive done it to two megadrives now,  it works a treat. You obviously know your stuff, so have I missed something in this mod which means my consoles are about to melt down?
retrogametech As someone who has painted MDF, Id say dont bother. The edges of the MDF will soak up the paint and it will look terrible. Id get a roll of stickybacked vinyl and cover it with that instead. Its resilient and looks professional (and would match your plastic bezel).
retrogametech Very nice.... I need to get the finger out also.. Ive found a friend who is willing to make me a wooden encasing.. just need to get all the pieces altogether :) I also agree with the supergun approach.. no need to solder right onto the jamma connector like some others do.. where did you get all the different sockets and that? (scarts, jacks, controller port) ebay?
retrogametech I just thought of a really racist way of telling what region you have the consol is. O for your region and  for Japan.
retrogametech I work in a electronic assembly factory. MDF has nothing on the lead I am expose to on a daily basis. I have little fear of the material as well. Not like your eating it or breathing the stuff. Also a good idea to have on eye protection its nasty stuff to get in your eyes.
retrogametech I could but theres really no need since I wouldnt use it :P.
retrogametech Looking good dude, personally I would vinyl wrap it in black as the finish would look better than a paint job.
retrogametech its gonna look awesome! i look forward to seeing it finished! great work dude:)
retrogametech Good luck with it Martian!!
retrogametech facepalm yes for online what else would it be used for
retrogametech wolf whistles heyyy sexiiiiiiii
retrogametech Yeah me too, why the hell do you type like that btw?
retrogametech No problem :) . Hope it helps a few people out.
retrogametech You should have directly challenged people to beat your time :)
retrogametech thanks for the video yet again u have made an excellent video :)
retrogametech im loving the title haha
retrogametech and how fast with a de magnetized driver? :P
retrogametech Ouch that Space Harrier music is awful! I almost started laughing as soon as the clip started. The Virtua Racing and Outrun looks great, really smooth running as well. Congrats on the 10k subscribers, you deserve it, one of my favourite gaming channels!
retrogametech 11:19......strange a collection without sonic
retrogametech The games on Sega Ages Vol1 for the Saturn are arcade perfect ports from what I understand. Thats why theyre so good! :) Got me a copy of that compilation a while back for that very reason XD
retrogametech That space harrier music is a lot like Aqua as well :P
retrogametech 16:05 this music reminds me of a Wii Shop Channel game I played. With a 3dTetris type of thing. I think it was called thruspace.
retrogametech My god the MegaDrive looks hurrendous with all the attachments on it :) haha! Poor thing but awesome video as ever Martin.
retrogametech Luke is awesome!!! Happy 10k martin!!
retrogametech Cheers, Luke. Yeah, I somehow managed to snag and partially rip the ribbon cable that connects my cams LCD to the mainboard. Luckily I found a similar but faulty model on ebay which I got really cheap and cannibalising for parts. Saved myself a couple 100 in repair bills! :) Feels great to finally get that last NGage game! :) . But now not having that Australia only Sega Rally release is bothering me, lol. Theres always something! :P
retrogametech Pretty helpful video. thanks
retrogametech Did you fixed the black screen of death?
retrogametech Exactly! probably those pesky kids :P
retrogametech Thanks, Ill try my best!
retrogametech i just enjoyed watching a video about soldering. some things can only happen in Glasgow... another great video mate, cheers, ashton lane rulezzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
retrogametech Thanks :) . Nah it was just a very light 1st degree burn. Its all good.
retrogametech wow.. well dayum, you done gone given me somethin to think about... now the question is, do you prefer the original or the XL (if youve tried it yet)? has anyone figured out how to region unlock the 3DS yet? i also get put off by its lack of backward compatibility with the GBA but i know thats a silly reason, especially since you could probably just play every GBA game ever made usin an SD card lol i have seen a vid on the toobs showing a 3DS playin GBA pixel 4 pixel, looked good.
retrogametech my 3ds shows it reads the game but wont play..even a brand new game oO
retrogametech Haha, now theres an idea for a future video series! I could get totally tanked then set about fixing some stuff on camera. It could be done Steve Benway style  Heres me fixing consoles drunk (badly), just so you can see what it looks like. :P
retrogametech Thanks dude and yeah I sure am! :D
retrogametech That LaserActive player is cool. Circuit City (remember them) had a dented one for sale years ago for around 1,000! And the modules were around 350 each! Hey, do you have a VHD player? Im into that format now. I imported a National 3D DiscLord PLUS a pair of the 3D Scope headgear. Im still buying LaserDiscs though. My collection is now at 1,034 LDs from the USA, Japan, HK, Netherlands, Germany and the UK. Great vid as usual. STAY AWESOME! :)
retrogametech I have a question. You do very well with modding n fixing. My wii all of a sudden wont play vids when i goto youtube. The load but never play. I think it had something to do with the wii update. Any info on how I can rectify this?
retrogametech hey luke i have a ps2 slim it loads my games but stops half way on the loading screen if you have any ideas please let me know because i really dont fancy having to pay out for a new one thanks.
retrogametech hey luke do know any solution for ylod ps3?
retrogametech Nice collection of consoles there dude. Personally im a little OCD with presentation, and i couldnt for the life of me leave everything all messy like that, Would defo have to have it all neat and tidy like RetroGameTech does.. But still very cool
retrogametech Thanks dude! I actually just sold my PSP and UMD collection recently. I picked up a Go instead since you can softmod them. Really compact and great for emus etc :)
retrogametech I really want an original Xbox like yours  Dreamcast
retrogametech I dont think you have a video in which you show your whole games collection.
retrogametech Awesome xD You listen to the best swiss Band 0 And I really love your gaming setup Q
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Thanks dude! No updated tour with your new consoles?
retrogametech look at that wad of black plastic, lovely :)
retrogametech Dude the really sucks. :(
retrogametech I remember in 20082009 this was the done thing if you had a DS
retrogametech Thanks For The Tip! Ill Try That Later Today.
retrogametech but if thats the case they really wouldnt work or work right... the official website to download the firmware is constantly being updated as well and the fact we can download the firmware and it works on the cards kinda means that cant be true ive never heard of such a thing anyway about the bumps even the r4 devs show or did show how to spot fake cards another way is the sticker on back or some writing which is actually the main way i think but again ive never heard about the whole bump thing
retrogametech a brand new R4 clone costs 5.85 with free pp not much profit to be made
retrogametech Emulating is legal if you own the actual game.
retrogametech Im pretty sure the first gen original propper ones had the black background.
retrogametech Using DSTwo on my DS. Works excellent. No need for patching and has all the real time savescheats.
retrogametech Ive already got more than Id expected to work again so its all good :)
retrogametech RetroGameTech I hope youve had a chance to look at the PM I sent you Id love to watch you do this modification if you could do a full on tut of it thatd be awesome. I think you could do it easily.
retrogametech thats sonic 1 game gear lv hard
retrogametech That looks pretty cool for what it is. I cant believe that someone took the time to do that, and even more amazingly how they foreshadow Sonic moving house to Nintendo )
retrogametech It actually looks nice. The sound is awful thou. :D
retrogametech OMG, the music is simply unacceptable xD.
retrogametech Have you never heard any chiptune or what can be produced using a GameBoy and LSDJ? You should YouTube it! )
retrogametech this looked alot better than i expectet! i am genuinly impressed! thanks for sharing! )
retrogametech The music sounds like a cryptic message from deep space.
retrogametech Woah how did you know?! It looks JUST like a real GB cart!
retrogametech Ebay, carboot sale, flea market etc
retrogametech Just want to say Im loving your videos and I also love the Double Dragon Neon soundtrack!
retrogametech Thanks, dude. Didnt you fix up a Virtual Boy? Or am I imagining things again?
retrogametech Thanks! I try to make as many as I can. :)
retrogametech Youre lucky it still worked and hadnt corroded inside!
retrogametech Hey Martin, Been a subscriber for awhile... thanks for all of the great videos! I, like WhiteSpartan down there, am curious about where you sell the consoles and accessories from your videos. Please let us know! Thanks, Q
retrogametech I also have brand new card slot if you need one how much is snipping from us to uk? I want no money for it.
retrogametech class vid i like how u fix them and sell them
retrogametech can i buy that nes of you please
retrogametech I have heard of the camera adding ten pounds, but making something look clean is a new one! Maybe its the lighting...
retrogametech I just did this mod, great idea! Everything seems to work fine as long as you dont get the polarity of the Mega cd wrong as this will blow a fuse in it, its an easy repair if you have any kind of soldering skills though. no more power blocks taking up loads of space and creating tons of heat in my cabinet!!!
retrogametech how much did it cost to make?
retrogametech Thanks dude. Did you notice the game I had plugged in? lol Had to dig that out after watching your recent gameplay.
retrogametech Ill have to do this mod a couple of times:). Where did you scavenge the plug ends from?
retrogametech As a mega drive gameplay vetran myself, OMG, at 2:21 you used one of those 12 volt outlets. IM PROUD OF YOU!!!!!!! Ya know, Id rather rig up a sealed leadacid battery in a cubby on the TV stand, and allow a lowamp power brick to recharge it before using more realtime watt output for the Sega systems, seeing that we only play video games for 8 hours a day at average. I can do some eyeballed math since I am an advocate for use of SLA batteries. I have other reasons in mind to use a batt
retrogametech Awesome work as always!
retrogametech Great idea mate nice one
retrogametech Thats a good idea but i dont trust myself enough to do it. Ill probably burn my house down lol
retrogametech Just wondering with the 32x originally having a 10v adaptor does the 9v power supply run it without any problems? Reason Im asking is Im debating building one only thing is i have a model 2 sega and it also uses a 10v adaptor.
retrogametech Quick question, how did you wire up your RGB cable directly from the JAMMA harness? I got myself an MVS board and a Framemeister, but Im not entirely sure as to how the wiring should be done.
retrogametech I love that both of those games share lots of sound effects from Metal Slug :D
retrogametech I think the most annoying part about that multicart is that the games are not in alphabetical order.
retrogametech HEY MARTIN, LOVE YOUR VIDEOS AS ALWAYS. IS THERE A CORNER MISSING FROM YOU TV?
retrogametech New Vid. That time again!... Get well Soon man.
retrogametech Dazza2292 us retro fans havent gone BACK to these graphics, we never left them!
retrogametech Hope you will get better soon, and get a working console!
retrogametech He Did A Video On It A Short Time Back, I Actually Just Remembered It Existed And Added It To My Wish List.
retrogametech HaHaHa! as bad as this unlicensed game seems to be,it looks to be better than an official sonic jam for the Game.com......LOL excellent video brother! :)
retrogametech the ring collection sounds is the confirm sound in the pokemon games. lol
retrogametech Hey, do you have the crash bandicoot bootleg made by the same company?
retrogametech The quality is that good because he is using the quite rare backlit GBA SP model.Usually the GBA SP screen is front lit which gives it that annoying glare effect.
retrogametech interesting but looks horrible
retrogametech when Sonic is in stand by, it looks like hes fucking jerking im off
retrogametech its the same engine for the Crash Bandicoot Bootleg
retrogametech :D Yeah, I love it, Ive never really been into the whole piratehack scene, but recently I realise that I should be as some good, and very obviously notably bad games have come from them, sounds like theres quite a few terrible sonic ones out there!
retrogametech I got a pair of tritton kunia headphones for 40 asda
retrogametech hey man!....great videos...i wonder...can u help me with.. Xstatic sharkoon 5.1 headphones i brought them for 2 euros on flee market.... missing extra parts....i only got headphones with cut cable... no volume control on cable,no digital device...no propriety jack. i peel off cable isolation and i got 1011 wires didnt mapped jet 4x two colored twisted wires 3x one colored wires red green blue mapped 2x plastic wires green and blue for neon light 1x dabble wire i bet its for mix
retrogametech if u would be interested in selling a set let me know... ill buy a set of fixnon fixed... i dont know y i dont buy faulty stuff online
retrogametech and how exactly did you connect these teo
retrogametech My Ears Do Not Hurt That Easy. But Reading A Comment With Every Word Beginning With A Capital Does Hurt My Eyes.
retrogametech That look like a RAM Issue to me. Now Im a bit extreme but Id try to verify that the RAM is working through a Test firstly. Do you have a LogicAnalyser or Scope? If so then try to grab Data from the ICs as they pass on the DataBus. This will require you to get at the Pins though, maybe desolder the 68000, replace it with a Connecter then grab it from there as it passes to and from the 68000. For the Custom ICs this will be harder. Good work thus far :)
retrogametech I have just been messing around with MAME to find out the test menus. So, to do a Backup Clear you would turn dipswith 1 to ON, the press A, then press Start 5 times. Then hold A, B  C. Might be worth a shot.
retrogametech Possibly a GPU issue followed by a bad cartridge  cartridge connection pin
retrogametech Im really hoping that all it is! :) This board is a bit rough though. Looked like it had been sitting unused for a few years.
retrogametech Instead of solding the new battery I just hold it with some electrical tape, which makes easier to replace, but this mod i so much better! Really nice :D
retrogametech everyone seems to say 2032 are the batteries to use for this. why 1220?
retrogametech Martin, have you read about the new coated lithium ion batteries being developed? Amazing stuff.
retrogametech Oh my gosh I LOVE THESE MODS! You just save like almost half my collection of game boy color!
retrogametech Could this same concept work with NESSNES games as well?
retrogametech Can you show the battery going in and out of the holder?
retrogametech would this work for normal Gameboy games like pokemon ?
retrogametech Would you be able to do a tutorial for this if you havent already?
retrogametech Have you tried this with NES carts?
retrogametech its nice but your black one looks alot better and the switches are much nicer on your black one :)
retrogametech People need to understand that getting the mod kits arent hard to do at all. If I can do it anyone can trust me
retrogametech D3FS3 Its actually to protect the chip from accidental flash
retrogametech I have one of these, its the business, but how do you change the text on the LCD, mine says toms box.
retrogametech for whom the bell tolls !!!!!!!
retrogametech Totally worth picking up! :) Get it soft modded and use it for emulation!
retrogametech Those are cool. Im liking the Mettalica!
retrogametech Where can i get one of these screens because i soo want one on my modded xbox
retrogametech 8:23 FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS
retrogametech Classic Game Room have got a 4 cart version of one of these with the cabinet. This board is crawling out of the wood work!
retrogametech Do you know how to fix bill acceptors?
retrogametech The chips on this board arent advanced enough to require cooling :) The Z80 is the CPU that was inside the ZX Spectrum and runs at a whole 4MHz, and the Yamaha sound chip is just a sound generator and shouldnt even warm up. It wasnt until the mid 90s that CPUs ran fast enough (and consumed enough power) that theyd get hot enough to need cooling.
retrogametech Lol, well I think you deserve a round of applause making it all the way through :P . You should definitely give it a go! Its really not that difficult. Very rewarding when you manage to fix something!
retrogametech anyone who finds martin boring when talking about something education like eletronic shouldnt even be on his channel. martin, keep doing your thing man. your videos are great!!
retrogametech Theyre adorable!But are they edible?Ill eat anything!
retrogametech Damn I want one of these great little addition to my collection, how much do these go for whenever they pop up on places like ebay
retrogametech If it worked that would be ... GODLY!
retrogametech Haha no way. I didnt even know they existed. And its japanese model too. I must this collection.
retrogametech Honey I shrunk the mega drive.
retrogametech Ive seen those floating about on eBay and they are super cute querky items :D
retrogametech Haha, the Dreamcast even has its own miniature removable VMUs! WANT!! XD
retrogametech Yep and theres a Nintendo collection too :) .
retrogametech Thats so cool. Technology being what it is these days, they could probably make a functional Megadrive clone that size. Id buy one :D
retrogametech Excellent progress on the MVS! Very lovely multicart too. Are you planning to build this into a cabinet of some sorts?
retrogametech I can almost guarantee there will be more hiccups. There always are! :P
retrogametech respect to luke love his channel too
retrogametech For now Im just going to get the power and video hooked up. If I see signs of life then Ill probably use my Xbox 360 Hori arcade stick for the controls. It shouldnt be difficult to wire it up.
retrogametech See it all clean up and ready to go.
retrogametech A great way to save some money. I suppose having a working pair means you could try getting an official pair but wouldnt have to worry about getting a working set. More of a display piece.
retrogametech At the moment the only 3D game I have is Missile Defence which is built into the system. Space Harrier 3D is supposed to be pretty good though. Ill probably pick it up since its one of the more common 3D titles. Space Harrier on the Saturn is excellent! I have it on a compilation with Outrun and AfterBurner. Its supposedly an arcade perfect port.
retrogametech I had the same problem at first! I thought maybe the glasses werent compatible but it turned out the contact pins inside the adapter were dirty and needed bent back into place. I should maybe have mentioned and shown this in the vid. I was really surprised how good the 3D effect works on such an old 8bit system! I actually shouted Holy st! when I first saw it working properly, lol. Now I want to hunt down more of the supported games. Have you got any recommendations?
retrogametech Its like the pause on a VHS tape! The image isnt actually still but judders slightly. Or as Eddie Izzard called it the Lacukaracha button!
retrogametech I have the standalone japanese release on saturn of space harrier (which I had purchased first) and the sega ages usa release with outrun and afterburner.
retrogametech Yup, any old clock that uses 7 Segment displays will work. :)
retrogametech Looks really good now its all fixed up! I wonder if its possible to find any of the inserts that would have been used with it.
retrogametech Modify the clock to work as a clock and use this as a night lamp :)
retrogametech Thanks dude! Would love to find some of the original promo flyers for it :) . Now, off to hunt down that giant GameGear you mentioned :P
retrogametech also, the L button skip thing: when you power cycle the ez4, it then tries to save from the nand memory to the sd card. if you skip it, boom goes your previous sessions saves. of course if you had saved earlier, then those will be available, just not the recent ones. gameboy and gameboy color games can be emulated with goomba and goombacolor.
retrogametech I do not have this, so I cannot say for sure, but it should be perfect, as it is not emulation. It is running them nativly, so everything should be 100 perfect
retrogametech Will It work with Pokemon chaos black
retrogametech Did the software run on a mac ?
retrogametech Has anyone used the Mother 3 english rom with this?
retrogametech Has anyone used the Mother 3 english rom with this?
retrogametech i modded my ds lite so it only has a bottom screen. do you think it can run a snes emulator on this flash cart?
GameSack I will be the reason they have hangovers if anyone is wondering
GameSack It was a great time last year. Cant wait for this! We will see you there!
GameSack Shame I am unable to attend but if you guys are ever at a convention anywhere on the east I would totally be there. Best of luck.
GameSack texas is so far aways :(....come get me in PA on your way down and ill be able to go lol
GameSack Dave, we can see right through you!
GameSack what year!!!!???!!??!?
GameSack What! I hope our idiots here dont scare you
GameSack Mannnn, a lot of my favorite youtubers included you guys, I so wish I could fly up the states. Good luck there!
GameSack I Like the games on the system. but at the time it wsnt worth it to buy one. Not to many variations of games plus expensive console. Love metal slug played it on NeoGeo emulator great game. My favorite on the system
GameSack Shit the neogeo was a beast.
GameSack Im going to watch the super popular puzzle games episode. It was super popular after all.
GameSack Your show is better than a lot of the game review videos out there. Some ideas for episodes and opinions.Bad voice acting in games.Show less Shooters.Coop 16 bit games.Left in Europe.Theres always been lots of talk about Mario and Sonic. Bonk for turbografx was the competing mascot. Could do a brief history on him.Be amusing to see you two switch roles. Joe acts like Dave and vice versa.
GameSack The best vids on Youtube!!
GameSack Are there any Fighting Games on the Neo Geo CD?
GameSack Great show guys! You should do a sketchonly special you guys are hilarious!
GameSack Come on dudes, Viewpoint is SO cool!
GameSack You guys are great yall need to do more episodes.
GameSack Was I the only one excited to see that they uploaded a new video?
GameSack Best produced show on Youtube....hands down.
GameSack Great episode guys! but I was surprised that KOF (King of Fighters) was not reviewed! was hoping or that game to show up. still I enjoyed the Episode :)
GameSack You guys still impress me with youre high quality production YouTube videos. I didnt know there was a Neo Geo CD console. Keep up the good work.
GameSack i dont know...the neo geo neer really appealed to and after this i still say no the neo geo cd, honestly i am not a fan early to mid nineties cd based consuls...it is a good effort but the quality of the cds and (graphics arent eer thing) the loading times, I mean i just want to sit and play. what I do not like about the neo geo cd looks like well, it is a fighting arcade and i do not like that, aside from that all other games were either games that are a ripped off of other games to games that are already on other systems than and now. With that said this was another great episode and although it turned me away from the system and games it was still fun worth watching. Thank you guys and remember this is my thought and opinion so please do not hate
GameSack I know that this does not relate to the episode but I just got today kid Dracula and damn is it tough
GameSack What are those switches on the side of your Saturn for, Dave? Also, Id would love to see Bahamut Lagoon covered in a future episode of LiJ.
GameSack One game that never left Japan which I would love to see you guys talk about is Legend of Legaia 2. The first one was a super amazing game (which sadly not many people have heard of that I know) and it really sucks that we never got to see the sequal.
GameSack Hey would be cool to see some games that got changed when they came to America. I imagine you guys know more examples, but there are the superficial examples like M.BisonBalrogVega in Street Fighter, however I just found out about how they changed a Ranma 12 game to Street Combat (SNES) when it came out in America.
GameSack Also Why did you guys choose games not really most people would even know of I mean like I appreciate you guys trying to find some diverse games but like mother 3, pokemon typing maybe some more well known Japan exclusive series
GameSack Dave White looks like a younger Eddie Fitzgerald.
GameSack While I think it could be its own episode, Id love to see Segagaga.
GameSack I feel like Radical Dreamers should be on this series eventually. Not so heavy on gameplay, but damn the english translation is fantastic
GameSack 14:00 is just like in real life.
GameSack Be sure to like this video up! Lets get 500 Likes, like only if you enjoyed though! I will be blown away.
GameSack Is there a confirmed Beta date yet? Because I still havent gotten my betacode...
GameSack I hate headlinestitles that end in a question mark?
GameSack That sucks man, I wish next year madden makes penalties for leaving early like paying 1k or something along those lines, Keep up the uploads!
GameSack Oh yeah baby blow in my cartridge. awe yeah fucking rub my disc.
GameSack Cracks me up every time
GameSack Im sure this should have a M rating. )
GameSack Damn even with the expansion pack the n64 still couldnt get laid..lol
GameSack wtf!!!!! did i just watch?
GameSack Well this is out of the ordinary. I like it.
GameSack That was a..... thing.
GameSack console sex YEAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
GameSack All things holy considered? The Binding of Isaac.
GameSack I really liked Rage Racer back in the day. Surprised me.
GameSack Ah, Playstation! This was the first console I ever bought (previously Id had an Amiga and an Acorn Electron .. and my G7000 was bought by my dad).It cemented my love of games forever! Tekken2, Wipeout2097, Tobal No.1, Silent Hill, Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil, FF VIIVIIIIX, Vagrants Story, SOTN, Rollcage, MK 3, Warhawk, Tony Hawks Pro Skater, The Midway and Namco arcade classics, to name but a few of my fave games.Had every Sony console since!
GameSack Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time was my favorite game on this console. The vintage Looney Tunes humor mixed into different time periods made the experience worth it.
GameSack Silent hill was my favourite game ever :) very good game
GameSack I loved both Vandal Hearts and Final Fantasy Tactics. So much time wasted between the two. Great games!
GameSack Vandal hearts was awesome.
GameSack I got an erection in the last part, is that normal?
GameSack My eyes are offended by the hosts
GameSack Its weird that when Im a grandparent this thing will seem to super ancient to my grandchildren just like Atari seems old to me
GameSack I know you said about people talking about mascots you didnt include, but can I thank you for NOT including Bubsy the Bobcat on the list, everytime someone talks about mascots they ALWAYS bring him up. So thank you ever so much for not mentioning him :D
GameSack 1) all living things generate CO22) while running on electricity doesnt mean that the device necessarily produces carbon, that electricity has to come from somewhere, and the most efficient way to do that involves creating carbon by burning things.
GameSack The logic that every platformer was trying to be a system mascot is so moronic it hurts my head, also all credibilty was lost when you trashed vectorman 1 2, amazing games featured in nearly every best of genesis lists.
GameSack Croc was actually supposed to be a Yoshi game at first, but Nintendo disapproved and it was made for rival systems instead
GameSack you guys forget rayman who was forgetten back in the day but has made a comeback
GameSack you should try the pc version of croc 2 its got way better visuals and a further draw distance.
GameSack Guys, you forgot to mention The SNES version of Captain Commando censored the blood, graphic deaths done by Mack the Knife, turned off death dismemberment, and a certain boss characters name has been altered.
GameSack Tell me where to get that Snatcher shirt right fucking now
GameSack This was a great video and I love what you guys picked and talked about.
GameSack Witzig und coole Aktion. Schau deren Videos auch gerne :)
GameSack I love the sound track to Road Rash...the way the Mega DriveGenesis tried to do guitar sounds great to me! :D
GameSack gaiares has the worst cover i ever scene on a game box
GameSack best game show on the internet for sure!
GameSack Please do more top tens!
GameSack Great show guys! Really enjoyed the special intro! Interesting choices in the list. Surprised there was no version of Street Fighter II on either list but the 1 on 1 fighting genre doesnt seem to really be the top choice for either of you guys.
GameSack I would include road rash and Dracula x for pc engine CD in my top ten 16 bit list also.Overall good game choices on the video but for the rest of the list I would choose other games. The only thing that hurts me from the video is that SCIV was choosen as number 1!Many people loves super castlevania IV and will agree with was a good choice but for me...is so overrated. Is too easy, slow and boring. I rented when was released back on the day and I was very disappointed. I suposse has good ambient music I must give it that...Dracula X for Snes is even worst than SCIV...For other side I consider Dracula X for pc engine CD an amazing game.
GameSack What No final fantasy 3, Donkey King Country?
GameSack Intro is waaaaaay too long.
GameSack Your intro is a sack of wank
GameSack Is the SNES version of Killer Instinct better than the Xbox One version? Besides the pay to play aspect.
GameSack Hah, is Dave getting burnt out on gamesack?
GameSack Rise of the Robots ftw :P
GameSack Any reason you didnt list any of the SNK fighters? Even if you limited it to the SNES or Genesis ports.
GameSack Watch Dragon ball z you will love it
GameSack World Heroes and Super Variable Geo for the Super Famicom.
GameSack So, and what about an episode about Kart games? Everyone knows about Crash Team Racing, Mario Kart 64 (and all the other Mario Karts). But having played a TON of those games, the only ones that I actually found very fun back in the day, were Speed Freaks and Chocobo Racing. Would be nice to have an episode covering all those alternatives, the average uninformed person was completely oblivious to.
GameSack Good video, but it was to long
GameSack Yo, you keep describing charge attacks like mortal kombat created them. street fighter did it first.you two are hella mislead.
GameSack Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed the videos!
GameSack DO a video on jazzjackrabbit 2 plz !
GameSack the soundboard of the last game is like simpsons
GameSack There used to be a vertical shooter in Pizza Hut. You could either be an airplane or I think the tankcar. Does anybody know what arcade cabinet this was?
GameSack They need to bring these games on a retro store area on PS3360Wii U
GameSack Alligator Hunt by Gaelco
GameSack Game Sack  a must watch for me these days. Thanks fellas, also recommending you to friends.
GameSack Love this segment. Hope you do more of them. Where is this arcade in the background?
GameSack Um Battletoads did see a console release. There were 3 Battletoads titles. Battletoads (NES, Amiga, Genesis and Game Gear), Battletoads in Battlemaniacs (SNES and Master System) and Battletaods  Double Dragon (NES, Sega Mega DriveGenesis, SNES and Game Boy). No offence, but you guys need to do a little research before making a claim.
GameSack Night Slashers looks awesome! Good call!
GameSack YEAH GIRL! You use that keyboard )
GameSack You make me miss consoleHalo, Major. Those customs we used to play were a lot of fun :)
GameSack oooh ooh! Can I be one of the semicompetitive player on one of the teams? GT is HAGSTROMS if you wanna make sure Im decent at the game.
GameSack Love it hope to see it soon will not be able to be that helper but soon
GameSack DO NOT KEEP YOUR POWER PACKBLOCKS PLUGGED IN...or they WILL DIE!Especially the original Nintendo. Just put your hand on the original Nintendo power pack while it is plugged in...its very, very warm and easily burnt out
GameSack Id love to see a MSX episode, as it was the home of the first games of the Metal Gear Solid franchise. Also Ive heard the MSX was used as guiding system for the missiles of the Brazilian army. Thats a very warring computer right there.
GameSack Because losers do not play THE COCKPIT!
GameSack Really great piece of retro gear I never knew existed! Thanks for another great episode guys. Really want to get one of these now! Love all the external nonsense you can hook up to it. MIDI ftw! P lol
GameSack some sega games looked like they had scaling. they played it off pretty good.
GameSack This video was Ok, for the most part.
GameSack When i was young, very young, i remember playing a SHMUP on the PS1It was basic, going left to right, but everything looked like mechanical junk and literally gigantic enemies that were like chunks of metal flew at you. I have never ever seen any footage of the game since nor do i remember the name of it. If anyone here knows, PLEASE tell me!! Its been driving me crazy all my lifeIts almost as if a dreamt the game!
GameSack Id buy one, but I dont know, its pretty expensive.
GameSack how about the FMTOWNS?By the way.... great video as always
GameSack About 80 shooter, 20 everything else.Can you say PlayStation?
GameSack Half Life 1 was always released... In fact, the best mod, SSH WTF mod uses this.
GameSack If you enter the wrong password it tells you to be different I dont wanna be different! XD
GameSack Fido Dido also at some brief points did the station breaks for Saturday morning cartoons here in the States...I think it was ABC in the late 80s early 90s??
GameSack Tim Follin music can save any game.
GameSack Nuts on your sundae, nuts on your chin. Classic!
GameSack Nice Fugazi shirt, love the show.
GameSack final option.. segal!!! haahahaahahah
GameSack i thought the pics of Steven Segal looked good in EGM at the time but seeing the game in motion I now see that it sucks.
GameSack There is a bill that was introduced to congress last week that will effect this show  others like it. You guys remember SOPA? Well, its back  we have to spread the word  contact your U.S. representatives. The bill is called the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2014. It is a fast track bill that would allow quick passage of the TransPacific Partnership. TPP is NAFTA on steroids  has SOPA tucked in its back pocket. So if we defeat the Bipartisan bill TPP will most likely fail. I beg everyone to look into it  contact your representatives. I do not think I understate it when I say this could be the most thing we do in our lifetime.
GameSack THE title sounds weird
GameSack LOL 3:41 i almost spit my coffee out
GameSack Mr Chow (From hangover) : GRAB HIS SACK AND RUN!!! :P
GameSack Dumbest fucking gaming channel on earth, not even funny. I didnt even have to watch, and i know they are fucking stupid.
GameSack You guys need to step up your game to get on par with other gamers on YouTube... you dont even look, sound or seem like youre enjoying what youre playing. Also, relying on random cut aways for comedy is not that effective. I think Smosh might want to start looking for some more entertaining commentators soon. Just my opinion.
GameSack 3rd is the one the hairy chest
GameSack no 1st is the worst 2nd is the best and 3rd is the one with the hairy chest
GameSack What gta are you playing 4 or 5?
GameSack I want you to play freeroam on multiplayer not this it sucks
GameSack Lol my computer lagged and i hers sohinki say all i care about is fuck
GameSack Get ian and Anthony back on thereGet ian and Anthony back on there
GameSack Hehehe nice thing you got there xD
GameSack Came from gamester81 video. I liked both reviews about retro duo 2. Thanks gamesack.
GameSack Game Sack  The Retro Duo Portable: http:youtu.be8LoRSZ2OWVw
GameSack Theres another Adapter, the Retro Port Adapter. It can replace the Retro Port Adapter the system comes with,
GameSack this one looks so awesome !! i bought 2 different supaboy and they both broke within the first two days
GameSack I hope there will be a better version of this one but next time have the triggers on the back of the console
GameSack Haha game stack, not game sack )
GameSack ... as comfortable as holding the balls of godI love you guys, never stop making these vids.
GameSack Is it compatible with flash carts?
GameSack I know you guys dont cover PC game, but as Dave is a Nintendo fan, he should check Dangeros Dave in Copyright Infringement from ID Software for Nintendo. (and it history of why it was impressive) )watch?vcj4HJkeQSg0
GameSack You should try sonic boom, it has some nice tunes.
GameSack I hope you guys dont stop doing these for a long time.
GameSack i really like pokemon light platinum
GameSack I am trying to figure out what program i need and how to add orginal xbox games i have many ISO xbox games
GameSack my favorite fantranslation of any game is still Mother 3although i do have to admit i was amused by the Finnish translation ofChrono Trigger haha..
GameSack Even if you dont like Sonic hacks you should at least acknowledge Sonic ERaZor, Sonic 3 Complete and Dr. Robotniks Creature Capture. At least you mentioned Sonic Classic Heroes.
GameSack This was a most excellent episode!
GameSack Jajajajaa Mojon Twins means, means Dung Twins.Mojn is the word for dung in spanish.
GameSack Is anyone getting this all the time for What to watch next? It wont change! :( :P
GameSack the knack is back and hes gonna kick your sack!
GameSack my name is lucas boby mc boby.
GameSack Please play far cry 3 its sick
GameSack I beat knack a few times and the boss at the end of the goblin fortress is the hardest one in the game. Even the guy at the end is easier!!
GameSack Fuck you!!! Trying to drag yourself more viewers by using the enthusiasm of gaming while is actually all lies!!! You attempt too hard!!!
GameSack I wish it was more.. red?
GameSack I am no beast of burden.
GameSack OK I CANT RESIST! Im finding myself reading comments despite declaring that I wasnt going to. Im a filthy liar. I just care too much about what you guys say, even the thoughtless comments. :)
GameSack The ending was pure gold. I am the kinda guy who likes sports games with TWISTS. Games like Mutant league hockey and football,Super High Impact,Nba jam,Baseball simulator 1,000 (and its SNES counterpart),Arch rivals and pigskin footbrawl! Seriously though technical sports games are crap and full of boredom. the ONLY ones I enjoyed were tecmo bowl and sighs while putting up shield for protection Bases loaded 2 : The second season. Another great episode guys. Keep up the awesome work!
GameSack Wow, I cant believe you made an episode that was about sports AND was entertaining.10 John Maddens out of 10 guys.
GameSack Include nba jam, on several consoles, and nfl blitz, on ps1 and n64, in the next sports episode. I dont like sports very much but those games are good.
GameSack I like that you gave plenty of time to the lesserknown titles. Id also have covered Sensible Soccer on the SNES!
GameSack You forgot super dodgeball on snes, pc engine, arcade and whateverBut good episode
GameSack it sounded like he said hit by a bitch when the ball hit the batter
GameSack Hey where are the Neo Geo other sports games? The only one I saw was baseball stars. What about super sidekicks series, golf games football games basketball? I think you guys dont like the Neo Geo a whole lot which is a shame.
GameSack Great video as always. I think you should try international superstar soccer series, there are 2 for the snes and one of these for the genesis, these games have beautiful graphics, great gameplay, and to me its the best soccer series of the 16 bits era, if you play these games i hope you enjoy them.
GameSack Fifa 98 for the N64. Theres a button specifically for fouling people and getting a red card.
GameSack dakujYa du bist einfach nur Genial bleib bitte weiter ttig auf Youtube du bist einfach Geil und ich kuck deine Videos so gerne immer wieder du bist einfach der Beste bleib wie du bist
GameSack Give it a few months after it happens. Itll revert soon enough.
GameSack We already have enough ppl talking about this shit so stop fuckin talking atleast get a better voice pussy ass mother fucker
GameSack The americas because they are talking about all of north america maybe?
GameSack I heard of yugioh being all about luck but this is just rediculous
GameSack Opening really well in the packs doesnt mean instawin. A long while ago I attended a Sneak Peek for the Power of the Duelist booster pack and everyone there said Ultimate Tyranno is whats going to win this tournament (3000 beastick who can attack every monster on the field once each). It actually turned out to be someone who had not drawn that card from his original packs who won. Funny thing is he used a completely useless card at the time synthetic seraphim which, in a sneak peek where no counter traps were added, is very much the essence of a dead card.Personally, I like this new option being introduced but would prefer it to be a choice alongside constructed deck tournaments. It really removes the budget barrier between players who have really good expensive cards and those with cheap, less useful cards.
GameSack if they want to test good deck building and measure skill, give everyone the same set of some odd 200 cards, then let them have free reign to make a deck from that. but using luck to give better chance is bullcrap by any standard
GameSack Of course luck is involved in drafting as in all ygo, finally this shitty company is trying not to have baddies winning their events by increasing the skill the player must have to win and people are compaining about it, i guess u guys prefer to see a 11 year old topping with dinnorabbit or some baddie misplaying all over the place and winning with some op deck, yeah this is why ygo is where it is right now, way to go guys.
GameSack Probably a horrible idea but lawlsy to the very least.
GameSack They call it the Americas because the US is the only country that refers to itself as America and as a northern continent, in other countries America is a whole not the US or northern and south america
GameSack ahhh being older and hearing greek names IS THE BEST THING EVER!!!!!
GameSack Streets of Rage 2, Road Rash 2 and ummm ....Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight.
GameSack I really love your intro, I think its one of the best I have seen on youtube :)
GameSack I AM GONNA BURN YOUUU
GameSack Wing Commander 3 and 4 are still awesome and way better than Wing Commander 1 and 2 Aaand you can play as Luke Skywalker :v
GameSack Super Mario Galaxy 2, Dragon Warrior 2 and Summon Night Swordcraft Story 2 these sequels are better than the originals that are already great games!
GameSack 22:10 yup I know what that game was based off of. Wasnt it Skyrim.Jk
GameSack One of my favorite followup games were: Double Dragon 2 (NES)  I liked the fact that you could start off doing every move in the game without having to level up  that you could play two players at the same time. I still didnt like the fact that your weapons disappear after killing a group of enemies.
GameSack Portal 2 is better than Portal and Metro Last Light is better than Metro 2033.
GameSack LMAO  inserting a NES Game Genie cart into the Neo Geo. hahahOh, and the VHS tape as well. lol Funny stuff.
GameSack Work with bakelite disc?
GameSack nice dude! I just bought Magician Lord on the MVS. Right now a CMVS is the way to go imo I bought the whole metal slug series for less than 50 each except for 5 which was 80. Is that a legit Neo Turf Masters you have?? O.o that things worth thousands of dollars isnt it?
GameSack Joes way of saying: I own a Neo Geo, FTW!
GameSack Neo Geo is so overrated, i swear ppl only want it because they couldnt afford it back in the day and want to feel like they have something niche.
GameSack How did you managed to cheat in the Neo Geo?
GameSack Consolized NeoGeo MVS FTW!
GameSack I loved the Neo Geo! It seems Im the only one in this community that bought the Neo Geo AES when it firt came out at full price(700) and for three years I bought most of its games at full price(200). I was a Neo Geo hardcore fan!
GameSack Ducktails IS hard as fuck on nes.
GameSack Slow tedious scavenger hunt VS good platforming I dont get it Dav the 2nd one is clearly better. Sparkster is so disappointing its worth way more money then the first, WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN! I wanna play this game dammit.
GameSack I fucking love you guys the chemistry, the (subtle) biases, the format, everything. I really appreciate this gaming channel. Keep in mind I watch alot of them and this is absolutely my favorite. I always go to it when I need a pickmeup or just to kill time and attain knowledge about one of my most beloved hobbies. Thank you guys, please dont stop.
GameSack Did you guys upload this late? I got this video in the morning central time
GameSack Skyward Sword was slightly disappointing as well as Brawl.
GameSack Super Paper Mario. Uuughh...
GameSack Excite Truck was great, so addictive, agreed with you on that, got it at launch with Zelda at Sears in South Hills Village. Never played Excite Bots. Glad I didnt haha.
GameSack Why does everyone hate majoras mask? I love that game it was the first Zelda I ever got in to. Collecting all the masks was good fun even if it led to extreme frustration when you had to start all over at the beginning of the three days if you messed up getting one
GameSack Streets of Rage 2 was a vast improvement over the first but the 3rd game in the series took a step back. At least in the PAL region. Changing the characters clothing colours and the difficulty was set much higher than NTSC and JPN version of the game.
GameSack Kriegers Ghost Baff Dish
GameSack JTC join the comnander
GameSack AHABAll Hackers are Bastards.
GameSack PLASPlaque am Sack :D
GameSack This is the CommandersquadTICS
GameSack FEA Fich euch Activision
GameSack KaFp  Krieger and Friends play
GameSack Final Fantasy 3 for the DS was a pretty good remake. I hear FF4 also got the same 3d remake as 3 but Im unsure of that.Halo anniversary was a pretty good remake of the original Halo as well though Im unsure whether it was done entirely from scratch or they just slapped new graphics on an old game.
GameSack Street Fighter 2 HD remix
GameSack Yeah, I wanted to download TMNT IV: ReShelled awhile back on my 360. Needless to say, I was not happy to find out it was no longer available. People say it wasnt very good, but I still wanted to try it out.
GameSack what about pokemon? ):
GameSack Thumbs up if you own both versions of Super Mario AllStars on the SNES and Wii! D
GameSack Its probably the best looking match up between 2D and 3D that Ive ever seenBlazblue.No no, Im serious, check it out if you dont already know it. I dont know, maybe it slipped by you somehow.
GameSack What a great channel, Came here with recommendation from Happy Console Gamer, glad I did, going to have a great time looking back through your old videos
GameSack Hey guys great channel! Heard about you from the happyconsolegamer and just subscribed!
GameSack I think you guys are great can you do a review of current console RPGs please or maybe a portable games isode I think it would be interesting
GameSack Hahaha! Stupid statue of liberty! I could so relate to that.
GameSack Viel Spa mit Guns Of Icarus! :)
GameSack In the next Gaming on Halloween, you should play Koudelka and the Shadow Hearts series. Those are HEAVILY horror themed RPGs.
GameSack oh man im so happy you brought up otogi. i played the crap out of that game in high school. Ive been needing to get myself an xbox so i can play those again.
GameSack king of demons is an awesome game just like gs mikami i didnt think anybody knew of the games but me ah i guess thats a little selfish sounding
GameSack lol, that special Halloween movie was great! Just curious, how hard was it filming Dave running backwards? Definitely adds a sense of creepiness with how odd it looks in reverse!
GameSack It was pretty easy for me. Might have been harder for Dave, though. We really had to go through the sequence of movements before each shot to make sure they were done in the correct order as Im sure Dave will attest.
GameSack I appreciate the voice acting joke.
GameSack I really liked Demons on the PS3 and was able to beat it fairly quick. But there was something about Dark that didnt appeal to me so I never bothered to pick it up.
GameSack That end movie was terrifying.
GameSack Dave you forgot to mention Splatterhouse was also released on FM Towns Marty.
GameSack Thank you for a great episode :)
GameSack Cool, ill be sure to check that Facebook page out and start spreading the news. And i respect you for not whoring out by begging for subscriptions. On the other hand, i really want you guys to get more exposure... maybe even get a partnership with Youtube so you can get some revenue, and maybe... just maybe youll go back to doing 1 episodes a week! I know you put a lot effort into editing and actually playing the games before each episode, but god dammit... 2 episodes a month is not enough!!
GameSack Nice movie. You guys could really pull of a remake of Peter Gabriels Sledgehammer! :)
GameSack Awesome, videos like this plus the awesome reviews are the reason why I am subscribed to this channel.
GameSack You know what happens when you build a house on a graveyard
GameSack Joe and Dave you so CRAZAY!!!!
GameSack Wow, what a great little video! Those stop motion sequences must have taken a while, but they look really awesome!
GameSack Yes and forced me to play until I beat it. Oh the humanity!!
GameSack great video! would definitely like to see some more of it!!
GameSack Good thing I just smoked a bomber before I watched this. Lol
GameSack theWatchingDog I never cared for those early Doom or Wolfenstein games either but I loved Mortal Kombat so to each their own I guess..
GameSack I had a 32x and it didnt need the power source or all the cables atleast i dont remember it needing all that and i loved it had star wars arcade virtua fighter and virtua racing, and after burner and primal rage loved all but primal rage that game sucked lol
GameSack 16:57 WOAH! Do not tell me that no one else whos played Sonic  AllStars Racing Transformed didnt recognize this music, for it had been remixed for the Race of Ages course! Wow, I thought that music was original not that Im disappointed, Sega is known for amazing music!
GameSack I don t see anything bad about cosmic carnage it seens like a competent fighter
GameSack Which of you is the animator?
GameSack DE HE JUST SAY THE SNES VERSION OF MORTAL KOMBAT IS BETTER THAN GENESIS VERSION? I WANT BLOOD DAMMIT!
GameSack no jokes for 36 great holes?
GameSack Cool effect in the end credits? Was that an AE template?
GameSack I just say Angry Video Game Nerd, all the way )(He got so popular.. his work is everywhere :D)
GameSack These Saturn, Sega CD games glorified on this channel look horrible
GameSack hmmm, that Atgames Master System is not real. Would be nice tough.
GameSack Uniracers got a lot of play from me back in the day. I thought it was pretty neat. Also, the bike in Stunt Race FX is where the speed is at.
GameSack Gex and Gex 2 were kinda forgotten
GameSack I was very surprised to see Crash Team Racing here on this list, it got rave reviews, it got great sales and people still love it today. And it actually did get a sequel Crash Nitro Cart (although it wasnt made by Naughty Dog). It definitely should not be on a forgotten games list
GameSack I will never forget CTR!
GameSack Aw, no Pulseman?Oh well, its cool to see Ristar again.
GameSack Call me crazy but Cyborg Justice and Tobal 2 should have gotten more play.
GameSack Mercenary on the C64.
GameSack Nice gameplay, man. I actually dig this game a lot despite the bad press it gets.
GameSack Mind u this game came out in 2011
GameSack im a dolphins video maker started in 2010 and returned this season cant wait for dolphins to play the patriots again in Miami see you then tyson
GameSack ok man I will ask you if I need take care peace and go dolphins
GameSack please make a double episode when you make a video shorter than 5 min
GameSack Sam more qualified to talk about coach driving than football.
GameSack Sack the shite out of Moyes! Sam Allardyce is the man!
GameSack A monkey in a suit could do a better job. This guy is off his head lmao.
GameSack Give it to Giggsy till the end of the season. Possibly the worst suggestion I have heard all season. I hate people who boo, what good does booing do lmao if we could sing as loud as we boo maybe the players would waken up during the match. As much as I wanted him to succeed, its Moyes out for me but I wont stop supporting the team I love.
GameSack Let this man give the half time team talk!
GameSack More from the great Andy Tate love this guy
GameSack Legend. We have no idea how much in need we are of Klopp. I say let Giggs or Alex run till end of season and make Klopp the new manager end of season. But these Twats dont care about fans. Their concern is a retired man
GameSack Hes right, the players dont care anymore.
GameSack The manager we should of got is now at Everton!
GameSack Customize your message
GameSack Joey: hey I know you have been romped several times today and you are already nursing a knee injury and your O line has given up and its 4th and fifty and we need you to finish out the season but.....GO GET EM!
GameSack Mettenberger is probably still pulling grass out of his teeth. Tough last 4 plays.
GameSack Saban must be some kind of autistic savant. He cant speak without moving his hands in rapid motion.
GameSack literally made his ass quit.
GameSack True football the NCAA fuck the NFL
GameSack welcome back home gus thank you for bringing auburn football back and the winning tradition just 1 yr....... war eagle
GameSack Carl awesome Lawson! War Eagle!
