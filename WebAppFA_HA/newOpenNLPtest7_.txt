retrogametech For complete Sony CRT quality condition remote 15 less than cost most video games Are you mad P You should see pixel perfect picture quality thing produces now I have fully optimised Id put money you drooling "
retrogametech The point SCART would have replaced all those other formats SVideo Composite etc much better quality boot Its just those other types cables 1 wire its entirely different format Kamen wishing wed started from beginning so we wouldnt have Component any other stuff literally reason use over SCART Its like how we should have switched Metric instead Imperial "
retrogametech That looks like TV only smaller D D The THREE dots SCART socket means its RGB your future reference Each dot mean R G B lines I could see scanlines when you zoomed size screen make them less visible If you turn contrast down should become more prominant "

retrogametech Not so much high standards more just genuine effort thought I dont even like DoA games you made entertaining watch so makes success me "
retrogametech The SLG does appear give illusion adding extra definition almost all Dreamcast games For example JSR DoA MSR Daytona all look better despite being typical 2D sprite based games They look amazing over VGA anyway SLG just gives little extra definition But I think its all down personal preferencesetups I didnt like results SLG SaturnMega Drive I prefer clean sharp unaltered image those Ive still test some SEGA emus DC "
