TopGear Auer dem Namen haben die beiden Sendungen mMn eigentlich nicht viele Parallelen TG UK hat fr mich unglaublich viel Charme Jeremy Clarkson Richard Hammond und James May sind drei Charaktertypen mit denen sich jeder irgendwie auch identifizieren kann Ich finde es unglaublich unterhaltsam wie die Drei mit smtlichen verfgbaren Klischees und Vorurteilen spielen Egal ob sie sich dabei nun auf Personengruppen Lnder oder Automarken beziehen Klar es geht der ein oder andere Witz etwas unter die Grtellinie aber nach so etwas gieren die Zuschauer Es bringt schlicht etwas Abwechslung das sonst sehr weichgewaschene und sozial korrekte Fernsehprogram Die deutsche Synchro ist allerdings Mist TG USA hingegen ist fr mich nur ein schlechter Abklatsch vom Original Die Protagonisten sind schlicht langweilig und die Sendung dreht sich letztendlich nur um das Hochhalten der amerikanschen Flagge Es gabgibt brigens noch TG Russia South Korea und Australia Sehr erfolgreich scheinen diese allerdings nicht gewesen zu sein.Auch Deutschland hat man sich der Vergangenheit um hnliche Formate bemht Die meiner Meinung nach beste Umsetzung gab es mit DMotor Leider wurde diese Sendung mittlerweile abgesetzt Die drei Protagonisten hatten aber immerhin einen Gastauftritt bei TG UK einer Sondersendung "
TopGear O que meu vdeo est fazendo ai sem devidas fontes "

retrogametech scart still confusing me why couldnt just use different connectors each thing i am sure just many people dont know what connection going through connector would different connectors "
retrogametech Maybe instead removing metal controller ports just cut off boltscrew parts leaving metal surrounds mount mdf plastic panel which ever way you choose way metal flush wood plastic much stronger "
retrogametech Ive seen few people starting similar projects here yours looks like its going nice looking forward seeing finished product mate Wish i could do stuff like "
retrogametech Lol you could make portable "
retrogametech I always do too "
retrogametech My Dreamcast has orange swirl Im American "

retrogametech I use all consoles regularly so theres point hiding them away storage If anything wears out breaks Ill just fix repair The ones storage wouldnt used very ofteneven so theres point having them out display etc "

retrogametech Love little flash carts All my game collection one cart beautiful thing "
retrogametech Looking correct firmware your clone I really cant help sorry There just so many clones hardware variations hundreds firmwares its impossible me say which one youll need You can maybe try one generic Wood firmwares people have mentioned here But other than Im afraid its just case trial error until you find correct one "
retrogametech The TT cards work nice used have one years ago my DS "
retrogametech I actually have Sonic 3D Blast 5 separate cart Seriously "
retrogametech where did you get "
retrogametech Its funny because music Sonic music slow mode kinda bad bit I can hear angel island 1st level "

retrogametech Its MD everywhere except North America They had change name North America because trademarklegal issues "
retrogametech Where did you get "
retrogametech The Title Screen music Title Screen music from Sonic Knuckles Green Hill Zones music Angel Island Zone Act 1 from Sonic 3 Just horrible 8bit versions "

retrogametech Woah thats kind creepy looks just like what I did Complete psone plug OO "
retrogametech Most official PSUs state 10V output I think Master System only one states 9V Testing multimeter showed most official Sega PSUs output over around 14V But all consoles have regulators circuitry inside them lowermanage voltage levels require probably only about 5V7V most cases You can happily run Mega Drive using 7.5V supply long PSU has high enough Amp rating "
retrogametech were do i send my money "
retrogametech Retro Game Cave sells all one PSUs Sega CD 32x "
retrogametech A mini arcade cab something like small computer monitor would cool "
retrogametech hey dude hope you get better soon Also ive been wondering while where did you get your watch Its awesome D "

retrogametech Get Better Man Just Invite Some Women Over Being Stuck In Bed Wont Be So Bad Then "
retrogametech WoodMDF probably easiest work MDF also really flat smooth which good painting andor adding some decals The only downside MDF getting wet problem here its bit heavy probably nothing worry either since its small console "
retrogametech Thats what Id like do one other boards Im working right now Ive got spare old monitor sitting storage would perfect something like "

retrogametech The toughest soldering job Ive done game console replace cartridge slot Mk1 Sega Genesis Ive never tried SMD I do have good soldering station so Ill probably do sometime "
retrogametech I owned SNES close when came out when I 7 got lost how isnt relevant I didnt have problem emulating instead I did buy another SNES off ebay more recently usually prefer I have game I dont feel I really lose anything emulating games I dont have One advantage emulation fact your game saves dont have limited lifespan since you can copy them save them back them up like any other disk file "
retrogametech No worries I wish hed reply me though "
retrogametech Any idea how do GBA carts They dont have little handle area top where taller battery holder could fit "
retrogametech yep battery ruby mine dead "
retrogametech A great tip Martin one reasons I subbed "
retrogametech Id recommend purchasing Mega Memory Card Game Boy Color You can back up lot your save files Ive backed up most my GBGBC saves already It works great "
retrogametech I have correct you Emerald Ruby Sapphire have batteries theyre used ONLY internal clock feature The cartridges use EEPROM save SRAM If battery dies out them can still save fine its just few time clock events game wont occur properly "
retrogametech Im planning do load my gba games "
retrogametech Is metallica ride lightning I hear background awesome man "

retrogametech Not sure emulator would need written accept "
retrogametech I just picked up exact same thing halo green edition 200 gig hard drive 80 us dollars "
retrogametech Is Xecuter 3 best mod chip original xbox "
retrogametech Someones listening RIDE THE LIGHTNING fist bumps "
retrogametech I suggest before start desoldering big chips you should find power ground Yamaha Z80 chip cut only those legs first power whole thing up Cut first power Yamaha test nothing cut ground Yamaha test Cut z80 power test etc you should get something screen since boards do have some BIOS checking install bios course "
retrogametech Never boring Martin The Yamaha sound chip too hot touch Id say swap out also my ocd find out where soundaudio caps replace Just ordered UnoBios after watching Lukes video its definite must have Havent had chance test mine out yet still waiting JAMMA harness unibios Interesting some similarities Neo Geo GenesisMegadrive Both have main Motorola 68000 based cpu Zilog Z80 cpu handle sound "

retrogametech Hope you get working Luke extremely knowledgeable has ton experience "
retrogametech luke morse geezer good luck project do love your vids "
retrogametech Haha I would usually frown upon 48in1 cart I must admit I have one myself my arcade cabinet possibly has 80 games home mo mvs carts whilst cheaper than aes carts still very expensive "
retrogametech What keywords would you use eBay search 3D LCD glasses Shutter glasses You didnt really specify give link "
retrogametech Ive got official glasses I got them relatively cheap Unfortunately theyre too small my head I get some Im surprised works "
retrogametech Some questions 1 Could you please say exactly how called glasses you using your video I wish order glases I want sure work my sega master 2 Do you need crt monitor get working properly 3d effect your sega 3 Do you get perfect effect I mean do you perceive double images some times I own original 3d glasses Back time effect perfect now sometimes I perceive double images because aged 3 "
retrogametech Just wondering do you have Space Harrier 3d If so how 3d effect I have Space Harrier Sega Saturn plays really well 3d controller "
retrogametech Punorama You have principles p "

retrogametech I heard about things like NES SNES stuff possible get flash carts like consoles N64 "
retrogametech Yes Mother 3 works even better since you can patch mother 3 ROM English play English version To play Mother 3 select game press SELECT A This permenantly write your cartridge load up instantly "
retrogametech reset option good so you can save your game even battery dead "
retrogametech Thats cool man How much does cost "
retrogametech I have almost 40 games my GBA hauling them all around me really sucks because case about size small purse I feel ridiculous carrying around me With thing I can have all games I own dont own one cart leave all other physical games home Having tons cartridge games really destroys portability console I need one "
retrogametech Could i use play snes my GBA "
GameSack Crap I live German "
