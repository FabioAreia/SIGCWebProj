TopGear Top Gear 16x01 ITA HD Completo
TopGear Sei veramente un grande meriti un sacco di iscritti solo per limpegno con cui ti metti a caricare video!
TopGear cool car, although I think a Wild Ferrari had sex with an Aventador, giving birth to what is the 6th Element. Weird. I still rather go for a TomCat and a Marauder for that kind of money.
TopGear Runs to the Lottery shop
TopGear Thats my car right there! Oo
TopGear Imagine that thing with a Veyron engine...
TopGear If I owned that car, my life expectancy could be measured in minutes.Actually, who am I kidding, Id just use it to drive down to the shops at 60 kph.
TopGear although this car is fast, but it looks very ugly...
TopGear Okay Lamborghini has given me a reason to start spending my money on powerball tickets!!
TopGear When can they try the koenigsegg agera r or koenigsegg agera one:1?
TopGear 2,000,000 for a Lamborghini Sesto Elemento? Seems reasonable.
TopGear 1,950,000 Pounds is about 2,500,000
TopGear I think its probably worth the money
TopGear THIS IS THE CAR OF MY DREAMSSSSSSSSS
TopGear Just ringing Churchill.....back in a bit
TopGear OMG !!! Damn thats THE car to have!
TopGear gta v high life dlc anyone?
TopGear OH. MY. GOD. MY DREAM CAR.
TopGear Omg its funny that he said its a bedroom poster car because I have a poster of this car in my room
TopGear Personally I feel that the interior is the ugliest thing in the world, but that might be just me.
TopGear This car is just amazing.
TopGear As soon as I finished the video I look at the picture on my wall of this car
TopGear The feeling when the engine goes WOOOOOHM WOOOOOOHM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! please someone notify me when the car is 100 euros in the distant future so I can buy it :D
TopGear Ugly and usless i go for the porsche 918 or the ferrari LaFerrari
TopGear Want to see Elemento vs Bugatti!!
TopGear The best looking Lamborghini I have seen. If I had the money I would get it.
TopGear it has the engine of the gallardo but a ass kicker
TopGear I would pick the maclaren p1 over the sesto elemento

TopGear Thats Like a Car of A Demon
TopGear Thats Like a Car of A Demon

TopGear Wow, that is a beast and beautiful car, with a pretty cool name.
TopGear Oh my god, when he screamed at 1:35 it sounded like Ricky bobbys mom from Talladega nights haha haha badass
TopGear My grandma would love this car.........
TopGear Ill take any Pagani over thing ugly looking toy car any day.

TopGear Does it have scissor doors?
TopGear Batmobile )I is the 6 th element!!!
TopGear that is the best lamboghini I have ever seen
TopGear love lambos but this one is UGLY
TopGear This car is useless for a number of reasons, i will attempt to point out a few, 1 this car is made of a very cheap blend of metal that they want to sell for the price of gold, 2 this car doesnt comes with spaceage criteria eg: no blue tooth capability, no iDevice docking, no comfort etc, 3 this car has no resale value, should you waste 2 million credts on this pile of rubbish, it becomes your tattoo, that would be cool except by the end of the year they are going to come with a new one, thus nostalgia would have to comfort for you and your corbonfiber tattoo, 4 this car comes with an engine that can only put out 500  BHP, now, you have much cheaper sports cars that has that capability, with buletooth and a radio, and a dashboard, and resale value etc, 5 its not street legal, you would have to be an ambassador to even afford the paper works to drive this shit. Now that is a very cheap piece of metal, with a mediocre engine that has no comfort, with a very ugly design, that cant even take a female out of her panties, now for the jackasses who are talking about its their dream car let me educate you, for 2 million creds, you could buy an Audi R8, an Aston Martin DB(whatever) a Rolls Royce drop head, plus a Ghost, a 2015 Porsche 918 spyder, plus all the new muscle cars for 2015, the Audi alone will get you all the college chicks, the Aston Martin, the Lawyer chicks, the Rolls Royce, plenty of Middle Eastern chicks, the Porsche, business class chicks, muscle cars, all the regular chicks, plus they all have resale value, now you might want to resleep that dream because it was really a nightmare
TopGear it proble cost 345,0000 who would by it
TopGear The wall poster thing is funny because I have a sesto elemento poster and no pagoni one
TopGear This is one of those cars that I thankful they exist, but even if I had the money, I wouldnt buy one. Id rather have the Aventador.
TopGear The sound at the beginning should be the new sound for the Tardis
TopGear gets paid to drive a 2M car in a 6 minute video.. I want that job. I would like to see that stacked up against a new model Corvette Stingray, GTR, ... and Veyron. 2 mile drag race.
TopGear they need to make Clarkson do reviews like these again
TopGear toyota ft 1 is better
TopGear You know veyron isnt the fastest car anymore
TopGear Interesting fact about this car. Originally, Lamborghini wanted to name is the Bristo Flapamento, but then the workers in the factory revolted, and actually canabalised one of the managers (as in, literally. This apparently happens quite a lot in Italy). The executive board backed off, and went with the name Sesto Elemento, which means Compromising for the sake of national unity. Weird, I know. You can read about the details in the new book 60 years of Lamborghini: the cars and the people.
TopGear i cant even afford an old murcielago...how i want to dream to get this one...huh...such a perfect daydream...
TopGear The real pity is that instead of Hammond sounding like an awestruck butch little girl reviewing such a car, the job should have gone to Chris Monkey Harris a man who knows more than a little about driving supercars and could better describe the performance of such a machine.
TopGear Am I the only one that knows that this car was in the need for speed movie
TopGear This is a very expensive track car, you could spend a million on a gtr to beat this and still have enough left over for a very nice daily driver
TopGear man that thing just looks evil :D
TopGear ME WANT: shoves money at screen
TopGear Whats the song at the beginning of the video ?
TopGear Honestly i want to find a video of this car screaming down a racetrack of ONLY engine and onboard sounds, no music, no narration.
TopGear id sell my soul to satan for that car .
TopGear Cool, but 99,9 of people here wont even get close to dat car, so why bother. No point in arguing who prefers what car. It only makes you more frustrated.
TopGear Oh my god! You guys actually uploaded a video I had asked for!! Thank you so much guys! Thank you thank you thank you!!! But you should have kept the original music in it. The Ginormous track at 4:29 in the original BBC version is so much more fitting than this production music. Why did you replace the music? Just why? But still anyway, thank you for uploading the video and fulfilling my wish!
TopGear Dont you mean, is it worth its two million pound price tag?.
TopGear its gaiest lamorghini
TopGear Supercars are just getting more and more ridiculous every year.
TopGear Clarksons carboat would have won it easily, if it was driven by somebody other than Clarkson himself..
TopGear ive just watch the episode on Netflixs if only Mays clutch didnt go he would have made it
TopGear I loved this episode, I havent seen it in a while, but I thought the first time I seen it, the Hilux was a double cab. Ha turns out I was wrong.
TopGear Sailing, Really boreing!
TopGear Surprised nobody tried a fan boat style rig!
TopGear 4:00 Most hilarious moment of the season, followed by the one that tops it!
TopGear Row, row, row your car
TopGear Happy Birthday, Jeremy! :D
TopGear haha I never realised they used mirror sails on mays carboat
TopGear Is that your car?Yes?Its the wrong way up...Dont give me technicalitiesThe much loved Clarkson vs May event banter, and possibly one of their best and funniest unscripted segments. Thankyou Top Gear.
TopGear this was on Dave today
TopGear look at the bright side! at least they stopped uploading top gear usa videos
TopGear is that your car?yeah.its the wrong way up!hilarious
TopGear Doesnt feel like it but damn this episode is old o: look at Jeremys hair!!!! Its not completely grey!!!!!
TopGear Its moving!...im moving!...its a boat!
TopGear Sailing is really boring lolwell true that!
TopGear water pumps work wonders  PEACE
TopGear Sailing is boring! James.may :D
TopGear I hope the guys still keep the show going on because I want to see more of them do more funny stunts and try new cars
TopGear those incompetent copresenter XD
TopGear I think that it was Clarkson that was saying during the Africa river crossing,Oh Lord we beseech thee, please let it go upside down while Mays car was crossing?
TopGear Can you give me a tow before you sink?I however was about to launch into a world of issueslol
TopGear bloody brilliant! Happy Birthday Jezza!
TopGear Happy b day Clarkson!
TopGear Haha one of my favourites!
TopGear I remember this episode XD
TopGear Sailing: really boring! James May  Captain Slow

TopGear Slow and steady wins the race.
TopGear Man, this looks fun. I have fun watching them have fun.
TopGear 4:40 miami vice yeah! hahaha

TopGear Its like The Tortoise and the Hare. Haha. ))
TopGear Toyota carboat.With Honda motor.
TopGear I believe we deserve to see a remake of this challenge.  Have a nice day guys.
TopGear 1M pounds and a leg either oneI wonder what hammond would have said if Clarkson said he wanted the middle one.
TopGear He who is last, shall be first...
TopGear Hilarious! Those guys are idiots!
TopGear This episode was on Dave earlier today
TopGear maybe you guys need some advice from mallard 3:30
TopGear This is THE classic challenge
TopGear Whens the new series again?
TopGear Im leaking.... too funny
TopGear this video is VERY VERY old why did there reupload it anyway?
TopGear Awesome. I like sailing its fun.
TopGear Incompetent copresentersI lost it.
TopGear Shouldve been bailing at the front so there is more weight is the back so it puts the nose up
TopGear I love the fact that the 225hp engine was almost nomnomnomnoming Jeremy lol :P
TopGear definitely one of my favourites
TopGear I think they love theirs job : D
TopGear 1:23 what are you thinking about?
TopGear Anybody know the composition that plays at 00:35?
TopGear I need more wind! loool
TopGear The American top gear already did this like 2 years ago
TopGear One of the funniest bits in tv history. :D
TopGear James shouldve had a set of oars.
TopGear Only 5 years too late?
TopGear 5:47 Eloquently put James. XD
TopGear classic.........jeremy may and hamond
TopGear Ah, man, oldie but goodie!
TopGear Now the world is in trouble. Iran has learned Western naval secrets and has stolen the technology.
TopGear I assume that most ladas broke because the lack of maintenance and people that bought it assumed since its cheap, it wont require any maintenance at all.They are so simple to work on and maintain but i guess that brits are lazy.
TopGear I love Russian cars :)
TopGear Interesting video.Thanks!
TopGear WICEJ INFORMACJI O TOPGEAR POLSKA:https:www.facebook.comTopGearPolskahttp:www.topgear.com.plZimowe Porsche Driving Experience w Finlandii pod okiem Waltera Rhrla.
TopGear cool emotional report
TopGear I guess Im the only one here that really doesnt find the 911 to be anything... interesting or special, and certainly not all that pretty.
TopGear This IS a love letter to a car. Precisely to a porsche911 . If I ever had enough money I wouldnt buy it anyway. But to me, this is the best car anyone could have. (for that price tag)
TopGear Singer 911  Remake of the Porsche 911Eagle EType  Remake of the Jaguar EType
TopGear the sound of the old air cooled engines was mad
TopGear YES! THIS is what the future needs! The old models look with the modern technology! Thank you SingerI hope they will do it with the Lamborghini Diablo or the Ferrari F40!
TopGear Ferrari is way better
TopGear My god, that Singer is gorgeous! Anyone who would take the new one doesnt know the world beautiful.
TopGear One of these days the Brits really need to consult a Science book or a dictionary, there is only one I in the word Aluminum.
TopGear I had a Pantene Hair Collection ad before watching this by Youtube... hommage to James hair?
TopGear You knowIm surprised Top Gear didnt do a drag race between the two acrs. that would have been interesting.
TopGear Topgear wont ever get old!! FTW!!
TopGear Whats the track starting at around 2:26 ?
TopGear Its beautiful and its the perfect hard core car enthusiast kind of car but its way to expensive I think Id rather have a new GT3 and a pocket full of cash.
TopGear Love the old one so much better
TopGear 6:45 Seires 20 Playlists Seriously? What gets me is that it seems noone NOONEhas noticed this! People are that ignorant these days. Yeah, its probably a typing error, series  seires. But surely TopGear can be more careful?
TopGear I have a question, is it possible to drive a old car like a porsche 911 on a typical road? or just is possible to drive on a circuit
TopGear James, I find your verbiage poignant and elegant in juxtaposition with the oafish moaning of the philistine you call Clarkson
TopGear The Singer 911 shows how amazing the us can still engineer
TopGear A love letter to a car.
TopGear Richard and Jeremy always make fun of James May when he says the numbers dont matter. But James is right, the numbers dont matter. Its how the car feels that matters.
TopGear Sence when Capt. Slow drives that good???
TopGear i have a porsche, its a 911 turbo
TopGear So much warmth and magenta in the driving part of the video
TopGear Pricey but awesome. Id take an 84 over a 14 any day.
TopGear As it seems its a drivers 911. Love it !
TopGear Hah! I have the same sweater.
TopGear no offense but first thing that came to mind as porshe has always been my dream car i thought lucky bastard get to drive more than one porshe in a day would be a blast good video loved it
TopGear Utterly ridiculous. You could get a GT3, Turbo, and a Targa S and still save 50,000.
TopGear When was this taken. (I mean the series)
TopGear Just Perfect .. old with new performance!! Just love it
TopGear Why change a good thing?
TopGear Too bad this cost 350k
TopGear I have always loved Porches
TopGear Oh god not another porche lol :D
TopGear James May is a true gentlemen.
TopGear Check out Captain Slow drifting away!!
TopGear I want it so bad........
TopGear captain notsoslow eh?
TopGear This video was done awesome thank you very much thats a beautiful car they both are. Very well done.
TopGear but this car has a PDK gearbox, not a 7 speed manual...
TopGear German precision with American passion  Simply amazing!
TopGear Anyone know the music in background?
TopGear I love this car but its damn pricy
TopGear sireis i dont even know how they got that wrong.
TopGear A love letter to a car...
TopGear Noice !!! Ill buy 4 of them when I win lotto
TopGear 50 years of the samethats not good thats bad
TopGear this is captain slow...
TopGear Very nice !One thing though, if the dress is 50K for 2000 hours of work and the Singer 280K for 4000 hours, the dress is better value for money. So i guess James May has to go for the dress than xD
TopGear Wow ! Who ever owns one of these singer 911s made the best use of 350,000. Lucky owners.
TopGear whats the name of the music in the beginning?
TopGear music 0:35???? pliss.
TopGear If only I had money...
TopGear Too bad the first one built was sold by the owner only six months after he got it....he wanted it to be the first...and didnt care about what went in to it....shame on you.....
TopGear When I think of Porsche you think wow
TopGear The old Porsche 911 coupled with modern machinery is absolutely glamorous. Bravo Singer!!!
TopGear Never thought id see Top Gear actually respect a 911.
TopGear Did Captain Slow drifted...? :)
TopGear This makes me feel better about mankind in the modern age.
TopGear Porsche should really learn something from those Californians
TopGear Super awesome job with the new 911 Porsche! Keep up the good work guys
TopGear That car is waaaay too nice.
TopGear And I send it all my kisses...........
TopGear that is the most beautiful car..... in the world
TopGear i m in love with its sound , and shape , and every thing else !
TopGear 2:50 for the business
TopGear Since when did Captain Slow test fast cars?
TopGear Turn10Studios We want this in Forza 5
TopGear all porsches are bad and they should feel bad.
TopGear An exeptional work for classic enthusiasts indeed, but...maybe, to be honest, in this car not a single crew is made by Porsche..and thats sounds foolish for a Porsche. Btw I like it so much!
TopGear What is the name of music in 0:35 please!!!!!!
TopGear So beautiful video :,)
TopGear other company should do that toothose classic are always the best classics
TopGear what does jeremy the 911 hater say?
TopGear Unbelieveable copy of a Legend. Made with love :)
TopGear Absolutely amazing! The Singer 911 is simply a work of art. One of the best things that could happen to a 911 is being done as a Singer. Great work Top Gear for uploading this video! Now please the Lamborghini Aventador Sesto Elemento next! Please! And keep the original music for gods sake.
TopGear Why on earth does Top Gear place so much emphasise on how quick a car can gofrom 0  60mph, and how well it can corner at high speed. Most of the cars testedlike this Porsche are priced beyond the means of your everyday person. At the endof the day, a car is a carriage. A means of transporting a person or persons frompoint A to point B. Lets get back to basics, a car doesnt have to cost the earth,and fly like a rocket. At least not in the real world.
TopGear Ferrari in the handmadepassion sense is not better, if you think they are...Because Ferrari just live off their name and that all there is to it for them its about selling Ferrari merchandising and plus a Ferrari isnt that special as they arent unuque in any way. Where as Pagani or any other car maker of that sort do not live of their name, they live off what they actually do Pagani being precision, art and true quality. Actually making something which one can appreciate properly.
TopGear that japanese laugh though lol
TopGear did anyone notice that the orange car was a s13.5
TopGear Pfft ... Hold my beer.
TopGear Sweet RX7. By far the most beautiful car ever made. The Top Secret S15 is awesome, too(Ive used it in Forza, which is cool)
TopGear i guess the rear suspension doesnt hold that long if the car is used for powerslides all the time
TopGear I would give my left testicle for a day with a real drift car and big stack of rear wheel....hell.. take them both...
TopGear that looks just like a holden
TopGear Now to bring in the Stigs Japanese cousin this season...
TopGear That was impressive! Those drifters were fun to watch. The closest I ever got to sliding like that was in my Ford Ranger pickup with 5speed Mazda manual transmission, thin tires, rear wheel drive, and a little rear axle ballast. Gets into controlled, squirrely slides when the weather is wet or snowy. Too much body roll for dry conditions though.
TopGear pfft I could do that :D
TopGear So damn cool. Make them regular guests!
TopGear brings back memories of going to the very first US D1 event at Irwindale Speedway.where does the time go?
TopGear Damn asians make everything look easy.
TopGear D1 Drifters are the best ever.
TopGear thriller music to top if off 3 Loved the video
TopGear I like it better when its a Holden Monaro :)
TopGear So.some said that the stig cannot drift
TopGear wanna see real drif look up in youtube arabic drift or libyan drfit ) enjoy
TopGear top gear japan anyone?
TopGear watching this makes me wana cry honestly the monaro is a holden, its australian made  built allways has been its made in elizabeth, south australia  rebadged to get sales up overseas, its sold as all kinds of car brands,
TopGear its a Aussie holden repackage all over the place gto in usa and vauxhall where ever they sell that
TopGear this video is really old
TopGear guys that have a problem with rebadged car are going insane if they are in my country.. well, mainly mitsubishi and daihatsu.. maybe a bit of hyundai..
TopGear I bet that Mr. Kazama can drift with a shopping trolley
TopGear That laugh at 3:33 ....
TopGear i love how the car is constantly beeping, trying to tell the drifter to shift hahaha even the car starts freaking out xD
TopGear It looks like the Pontiac GTO
TopGear I respect how much love the producers show to DJ Shadow when picking music.Quality tracks.
TopGear I think if you want to make a drifting video, use a Toyota Sprinter Trueno Apex GT AE86. Please excuse any errors in the first sentence, but its a true classic.
TopGear So the Vauxhall Monaro is pretty much the Pontiac GTO of a few years ago? Looks like the same car. Glad to see the GTO is still alive and well as a Vauxhaull now that Pontiac is gone.
TopGear That Looks A Lot Like A 2006 Pontiac Gto
TopGear lol the stigs long lost cousin is found
TopGear Pff i could do that in a fwd Dodge caravan
TopGear tanoshii  that sums it up nicely
TopGear Drift racing JAPAN, drag racing USA, insane speed EUROPE
TopGear Vauxhall Monaro is to much similar to Pontiac GTO :
TopGear Holden Manaro you mean!
TopGear God donuts outside the car
TopGear Watching this all I can see is....GTO lol
TopGear D1 drifters awaaaaayyy
TopGear 5:51 is the coolest thing ive ever seen in my life.
TopGear The Vauxhall Monaro is simply a re badged Holden Monaro
TopGear The Vauxhall Monaro is simply a re badged Holden Monaro
TopGear So thats how V8s gained popularity in Drifting...
TopGear are there american versions of these cars?
TopGear awesomecheck my clip pleaseAUDI QUATTRO 2.7 TWIN TURBO 250BHP SOUNDS AWESOME
TopGear In United States we call it the Pontiac GTO
TopGear why the front side of 240sx is replaced by 1 from silvia?
TopGear 3:33 so funny stopit onthe .
TopGear Pffffff tuned pontiac
TopGear What 20 morons disliked this?! Bah!
TopGear hmmm looks like a Pontiac GTO
TopGear wheres the drift king...Keiichi Tsuchiya
TopGear This indeed looks exactly like a Pontiac, Especially with the double duel exhaust and the V8.
TopGear Dom can drift better then that...
TopGear This, is the Pontiac GTO...
TopGear I need these guys to come to finland, and battle off with our drifters! Japan will always be number 1 thou xD Id just want to see these guys here! :D
TopGear Vauxhall? or he u mean Pontiac GTO?
TopGear really top gear is the awesome car show
TopGear Having been impressed with the Vauxhall Monaros incredible power slides, Richard takes the new VXR model out for a test spin around a very wet track. But what will Japans D1 Drifters make of the Monaros power sliding abilities? Powerslides with the D1 Drifters  Top Gear  Series 6  BBCPowerslides with the D1 Drifters  Top Gear  Series 6  BBC
TopGear Did you see his face when he started drifting it? Pure concentration.
TopGear D1 Drifters VS The Stig!!!!!!
TopGear building steam with a grain of salt
TopGear Kazama is one of the best
TopGear GTO still looks better in America
TopGear My mans had a boner at 6:14 lol
TopGear finally Top Gear DRIFT!!!
TopGear That guys laugh...sounds like it was pulled from a cartoon
TopGear For my fellow Americans: Vauxhall Monaro  Pontiac GTO
TopGear Pffft, i can do that!
TopGear LOL Kazama! For a second I thought I was watching watching Best Motoring.
TopGear Its the GTO body style
TopGear personally I find american muscle cars easier to drift with than japanese modified ones because american muscle cars produce alot of wheelspin and have no traction control so u can just brake and turn in the wheels in the opposite direction your going just like in pixars cars turn right to go left
TopGear .........................................thats it........................top gear us sucks....
TopGear great vid, great car, great end song!!!
TopGear Makes you wonder if the Stig is watching and feel jelous at the D1 racers drift style.
TopGear eccomi  !! thanks  e continua grande ..
TopGear Perfect! Domani versi che ora lo carichi l altro?
TopGear Anche meglio grazie mille! Continua cos
TopGear Top Gear 18x04 ITA HD Completo
TopGear This is just stupid though, i find it hard to believe that it can cut grass at that speed anyway. So its just made to break a record. Quite silly that it would be a well known brand that did that and not some hobby mechanic or whatever.
TopGear sounds like a 2014 f1 car
TopGear If Mario Kart was real, I would use this.. I can just mow the bananas on the race track lol
TopGear Wish they wouldve went into detail about the motor, wish i wouldve never sold my banshee
TopGear it kinda stopped being a mower a long time ago
TopGear Ha, it still has the mower deck attached!
TopGear Im gettin one of these.
TopGear so essentially its a grass cutting quad bike
TopGear If the blades underneath that thing actually worked it would have took off.
TopGear Yeeey, excitement about a meaningless feat. Woooo
TopGear Jesse James needs to drag race his Monster Garage Mustang lawn mower against this, hahahah
TopGear Pshhh. You call that fast? Stigs great grandmother moves faster in her coffin.
TopGear That must be one fun lawn mower to drive!
TopGear That moment you have a honda civic and realize a lawnmower by the same company can go faster....sigh
TopGear So according to the description, this is the Stig!
TopGear Tim the tool man Taylor would be proud.
TopGear Damn I was hoping for a crash
TopGear can anyone tell me what music this is?
TopGear It isnt american but how american could you get?
TopGear I wish they wouldnt have tried to make this so inspirational. Almost made it not watchable.
TopGear Alvin Straight should have had that Mower..
TopGear Ah put a 350 in one then through wheelie bars on it and call it done.
TopGear Who would cut grasses with that speed?
TopGear You its serious business when youre dynoing a lawn mower.
TopGear This is how you get the ladies!
TopGear Dad: Dearest! Im gonna go mow the lauwn now. Be back in a few, okay?!Mum: Your doing what?!
TopGear So when does vtec kick in yo?
TopGear take that to the inwood 500 in canada trapter racing friggin rights
TopGear I see it now, Top gear presents... the Honda Mean Mower Race.
TopGear Umm you have just seen a bunch of people with too much time on there hands and nothing to do.
TopGear LIKE A NINTENDO MARIO CART !!! GREAT !!!
TopGear The video is in Barcelona (Catalonia).Of Montmelo.:)
TopGear I watch this 10 times a day
TopGear Engine is a 109 horsepower VTR Firestorm 1,000cc engine, but grass cutting is done elctrical, so i wouldn call it a real lawnmower....
TopGear use slick tires..might go faster
TopGear Totally agree the mowing deck should work to be called a lawn mower
TopGear Cut the grass at the same time or it will not count :)
TopGear 2 words... Mario Kart
TopGear No way its still a lawnmower. The blade would have turned it into a hovercraft. I assume there is a flywheel in place of the blade, and there is a Honda motorcycle engine in place of a lawnmower engine..... this record is complete b.s. this is not a lawnmower.
TopGear It has to be a fully functioning lawn mower to qualify for the record. So I would think beast is totally capable of cutting your Dads lawn in 30 seconds flat lol
TopGear sounds better then modern F1 :D
TopGear I will defend this precious mower from all those zombies!!! Plant, getem all!!! plantsvszombies
TopGear lol.  Id like to see it cut a long strip of grass at high speed.
TopGear out of my way fools...gotta get to other end of my yard in under 1 sec D
TopGear Ok. Now take that tech and put it in a small 1 seater comuter car.
TopGear Some say he holds more world records then Chuck Norris... All we know is, hes called the stig!
TopGear how fast is that outside of middle earth
TopGear At what point does a lawnmower cease to be a lawnmower?
TopGear Can he come cut my grass?
TopGear Would like to see that go around the Top Gear test track.
TopGear VTEC Just kicked in yo :D
TopGear My umk brush cutter is faster.
TopGear what is the name of the driver?
TopGear Can I mow my lawn while going the top speed of 130 mph
TopGear 200 kmh p en trdgrdstraktor! Speed Weekend FunsdalenThis video shows a speed of over 200 kmh on ice with a lawn mower. And that with studded tires. The swedish mower is geared for 246kmh but didnt get into those speeds because of the conditions.
TopGear Im gonna mow the shit out of your lawn
TopGear Meanwhile in the F1 world...
TopGear Not so much civics but more so NSXs and S2000s. Oh youre right though. Just terrible cars. In response to another post, it does have a working blade. It is driven by I believe two electric motors rather than a normal setup driven by the engine. It has to be able to work as a mower to meet the Guinness criteria.
TopGear way to dramatic... just show the damn lawnmower already
TopGear oh em gee, much better than the murican one u gaiz huhuh
TopGear 116.575 mph  187.61 kmh wow
TopGear If only it could be like a Chaparral 2J or those Gran Turismo Red Bull machines where the mowing blade is modified for fan suction (probably wouldnt cut grass or hold a bag for clippings).
TopGear HONDA  Y U NO VTEC MOWER?
TopGear What a useless exercise
TopGear Next goal. 200kmh on a mower. Go.
TopGear I didnt know Honda had a Formula 1 team in development.
TopGear 85 mph and yet its a lawnmower. thats going to lawn your grass in seconds!
TopGear Absolutely badass!! You, Doc, are on a roll my friend! Keep them coming.
TopGear Wow thats so insane! Very cool video! Must have been a crazy ride!
TopGear Its annoying to know that this happens just down the road from me and I have no idea about it :
TopGear any idea what was the time lap?
TopGear 1:16 at the point I would have start to shat myself!
TopGear Thanks for all of your wicked videos Docta. I think a series of reaction videos, in which you give unsuspecting onlookers a quick ride in your Aventador, would be neat. Recording their facial expressions and what not. Who knows, it may not be worth the hassle.
TopGear Damn such a privilege I bet lots of super car owners out there are jealous on you
TopGear awesome docta!!!! The p1 is shocking, saw it in person a few weeks back, beast of a car.
TopGear This is crazy!! and im not a Mc Laren fan! Im a massive Ferrari fan instead. But this car is really something different! its a weapon! Cant wait to see compared to LaFerrari
TopGear WOW! That is INSANELY fast!
TopGear Awesome, i just love that sound turbo makes at 1:41. What an absolute beast
TopGear how fast was the lap? since we have to wait until june or so for top gear to do a powerlap in the P1
TopGear Chris cracks me uphes going fast as fuark in one of the most badass supercars of all time, and hes just talking to you like normal, even using his other hand for emphasis as hes explaining stuff like no big deal haha. Just in the passenger seat Id be scaredthrilled speechless!
TopGear Ive been waiting to see this thing in action, thanks for the video!
TopGear Goddamn automatic spoilers are SEXY! You gonna get a P1 Docta?
TopGear Chris Goodwin, Mclaren Chief Test Driven takes us on a hot lap at the TopGear tes track. INSANITY happens!
TopGear Hopefully its faster than the Porsche 918 for Jeremys sake.
TopGear was surprised when I saw top gear track in the title
TopGear I love this car.What a sound but one question:What us the time lap?.By the way say i love your movies Docta :)
TopGear Very nice car, sounds sick from inside when he gets on it!
TopGear 01:11.8 my prediction
TopGear That wouldve been fun! How did you guys hook this up? P1  So rare
TopGear This is totally insane!
TopGear Incredible video of the ridiculously amazing P1! I cant imagine how much fun it was to sit in the passengers seat with Mr. Goodwin at the controls. Definitely looking forward to the POV video.
TopGear Amazing!!! Since the MP412C has done it in 1.16,2 sec., then I guess, it made it in 1.12,6!!
TopGear I wonder if Chris is the new Stig?
TopGear Will we get to know the lap time and will you release the POV vid this week?
TopGear Very nice content DoctaM3, Im from the philly region and hope to meet you one day at a car event!
TopGear That sound is amazing!
TopGear Poor P1 on such a crappy track!! Yes I know it was in race mode and stiff but still :(
TopGear It sounds like a nascar
TopGear Casually commentates in Jeremy Clarksons voice. xDQuick question, DoctaM3, is that the Sony ActionCam? If so, would you suggest using an external mic to record sound or is it pointless? Im hoping to record a few laps of a 1988 Audi Quattro going round Cadwell Park in May.Thanks in advance. :)
TopGear Motortrend got their hands on this one also. I think a video is coming soon. It has clips in the gtr vs Z28 video. They have some numbers on it also. It is faster then Roadandtrack 918 tested.
TopGear DoctaM3 I bet this was such a breath taking experience! As always, very good work. Did you have the opportunity to drive it around the track as well?
TopGear Amazing Video! Amazing Car! Amazing Driver!
TopGear i was so happy when the music stopped so we could listen to the symphony this machine produces. what an insane car!!
TopGear Has always fantastic vids ))
TopGear i can hear Jeremy Clarksons voice going through my head.. 2 corners left..... into the gam bon... aaaaaanndd across the line!!
TopGear Down shift sounds is awesome, love the color too. good look on the vid Docta. Be Safe).
TopGear I knew it! You were on the Top Gear track!
TopGear That car is amazing .. great video as always !!
TopGear Hey Doc, did you get to time the lap?
TopGear How does it compare to the Huayra?
TopGear Did you use Sony HDR AS30 ??I bought HDR AS100V recently. Its great.
TopGear Love the car, do you like it more than the Aventador? Thanks for the video DoctaM3.
TopGear Looks good with the carbon fiber door painted the same color as the car.
TopGear Wow docta that was awesome insane incredible Jesus
TopGear So much better than LaFerrari
TopGear This is a track on Forza 4
TopGear 1:10 with a passenger. pretty quick car
TopGear Weve mixed karaoke with an 86 and put it all on the track. You wont believe what happens next...
TopGear Hi toyota, where can I purchase 3 landcruisers asap? Coming from overseas

TopGear Top Gear 18x02 ITA HD Seconda Parte
TopGear I would get the fishing rods out if I was on the Avon.
TopGear Hammond: Thats the best thing Ive ever survived!!!Says the man who lived through a 300mph rocket car crash.
TopGear LMAO during the Pincer Movement.
TopGear Does anyone else notice that the fan isnt even moving?
TopGear Ambitious but rubbish
TopGear This is actually a fitting analogy. Jezza is Kirk, May is Spock and Hammond being the practical sort of fellow, is Scotty. :D
TopGear Where is the Avon river,I mean witch Avon river are they on (there are 3 Avon rivers)???
TopGear HoverVan Havoc  Top Gear  Series 20  BBC
TopGear COME ONNNN! POWAAHHHHH!!!
TopGear one of my favourites, just cant stop laughing!
TopGear It make me cry is so funny.you cant replace them in any way!!
TopGear YouTube TopGear videos in HD!? I never thought Id live to see the day.
TopGear The guy in the middle looks like a morph of Hugh Jackman and David Tennant. Hehe
TopGear Good one BBC 8:07 Click here for the best of seires 20.
TopGear My favorite segment of all time. So funny.
TopGear Lmaoo man lml love these guys
TopGear Do you want to go over backwards i dont wanna go over at all lmao
TopGear Their reaction is better then PewDiePies i must say
TopGear lol, Back to the studio
TopGear Funniest top gear episode Ive seen. Epic
TopGear 3:54 The Pincer Movement moment LOL!
TopGear The Three Stooges again!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear HoverVan Havoc  Top Gear  Series 20  BBC
TopGear please, have you learnt anything guys, never give a map to James May
TopGear Hahahahahaaha!!!!!!:)
TopGear This is why top gear uk is better.
TopGear Hahahaha I laughed so hard. Good Work :D
TopGear YOU PILLOCK!!!!! lol.
TopGear Power and flower tetouani matador
TopGear Im going to go back up. Thats my kind of thinking. Thanks guys.
TopGear love the driving, you had to try going up it was the fun thing to do.
TopGear these trio were Hilarious..
TopGear A bunch of idiots. And I watched it!!
TopGear Why isnt he listening hes so stupid !!!!! LOL
TopGear You pillock, youve blown the engine...  Echoes of when Jeremy test drove the XJ220... Jaguar say this car can go up to 89mph in first gear...lets see if it can do 90 odd... Well the result was the same apparently...!
TopGear what episode is this?
TopGear USA tried to copy uks tv shows and fail epically they are just useless at being funny oh and making cars haha
TopGear the orang utan as captain? wrong...very wrong
TopGear lloll kill engine hover van hihihi
TopGear just watched this episode on Netflix. hilarious
TopGear Its really funny!!!!!!
TopGear Man did u see the size of that wier it was like 1 maybe 1 and a half metres pure rebal
TopGear Just a normal day at the office...
TopGear Want to get itunes, amazon gift cards and paypal cash?use tiny. ccpdown tiny. ccfcash
TopGear Who cares if its staged, what matters is that it is entertaining and funny so the people who hate can go watch 5th gear and wear your suit and tie not your clothes you feel confutable in.
TopGear Its compressed air not pure oxygen lol
TopGear people would rather see innocent lunch goers getting drenched then seeing staged actors?
TopGear Wheres the reat of the episode
TopGear i laughed so hard when he said  my kingdom for a horsepower because the quote actually is  a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse XD
TopGear inhaling pure oxygen is potentially hazardousNot a single warning about inhaling the crap from a blown up engine though.
TopGear that would be something jeremy would do
TopGear Theyre getting better!
TopGear I always think of them as 3 friends who just got crazy ideas while beeing drunk..
TopGear i want to se a stig lap :)
TopGear Still the best Television series ever.
TopGear Really not a fan of TopGear but this one looked like fun!Pity that bellend Clarkson fried the motor though, all in the name of entertainment I suppose.
TopGear Perhaps that rear and center differential would benefit from a downshift  weightshift into the corner to kick out the rear wheels rather than locking up the rear wheels with the emergency brake. Not so great on your street designed AWD car.
TopGear 8:30 faster than a porch 911 turbo? hes kidding right? lol
TopGear saabs at 2cnd gear are beasts if you own a saab you always race at a rolling start because youll win from a 0mph start they arent so great due to FWD.
TopGear SAAB mediocre at best?.....this is the sort of infantile gigglechallenge bred in the land of automotive myopia. The only front wheel drive car I liked well enough to buy was the 9000 and it would have been a better car as a rear drive...That said, there are SAABs I didnt like yet the motoring world gave the 9000 rave reviews year after year ,and it was well deserved. The driving position and outlook for example in the 9000 is better than any other vehicle. Safety excelled in the 9000. The motors are brilliant though my Cosworth 4wd Ford is along the same lines and is rwd. The Americans introduced the rear end wallow as can be seen in the 95 in this Clarkson fantasy race. Instead of fixing the few SAAB defects they fixed what wasnt broken but again...that can be repaired also by experienced SAAB small shop specialists. All the same if one watches on, Utube, the SAAB used in the appalling police pursuit of a motorcyclist and pillion passenger both I presume which died and which went for about an hour in Sweden.....you are not looking at a mediocre performance. Like Cosworth, so many SAAB hotups are overdone and perhaps plain stupid and to no good purpose but I have never yet seen a SAAB 9000 advertised for sale ...as were many hotted Cosworths.......because after increasing horsepower by say 200400 the owner found himself unable to drive safely and particularly in UK it seems....... I own 4 of the 2.3 turbos including the Aero, Carlsson and Anniversary only the latter being auto and cannot bring myself to sell them. Even stationary they are a very much and timelessly pretty car............ SAABs demise was largely brought about by resale price free fall and that was due to unscrupulous service agents. You could buy a good house in Australia in a good Northern suburb for well less than the price of an Aero ...a safe car overtaxed to blazes to protect pusboxes like Holden and Ford. .............One SAAB I lookedat had over 7500 for one service!!..I looked for R and R head , recod engine or some major event...no, all small stuff. Over 15 years my biggest outlay has been R and R clutch assembly on one car, and a personal decision as I do to any car I am driving often, Bilstein suspension. ............The cost of replacing engine mounts is a sharp pin in the hip pocket as two are hydraulic. I did that once, recommended by the suspension specialists and found it wasnt needed. One of the great cons was to tell people that the engine had to come out to do gearbox repairs...around 2000 labour...which is a blatant lie....both manual and auto boxed can be removed after removing the LHS wheel and disconnecting the lower suspension point. ..................Like my BMWs, driven well they cost little to run and so I can splurge on my suspension improvements which simple are Bilstein sports shocks maybe springs and certainly tyres and then a truly expert wheel alignment which includes road testing.....I dont use poly bushes...they are a bad idea. ...................The 9000 is a better drivercar than the Carlsson and both are better and more interesting than what spent decades catching up to what these cars were in the 1990s. ...............Mediocre at best ...I dont think so nor did the motoring commentators world wide..., but then what is it being comparedagainst?? A great, el supremo, motor car today has to have one massive asset uber alles...400W1000W channel stereo....To call something mediocre is easy, to know mediocrity quality and real, top quality takes wideranging driver experience.
TopGear The Saab 95 Aero is an allround supercar for a bargain! It has all you want from a car and can last a lifetime! Try it out! I own one! Saab made sensational cars and develloped the turbo 4cylinder to the limit! R.I.P. SAAB!
TopGear Shitty American CEOs and product planners are what happened to Saab
TopGear Saabs are mediocre cars at best. Theyre not horrible, and not even that unreliable as they say...problem is, like Jeremy said....The price isnt mediocre....
TopGear reminds me on toyota g86 and subaru brz
TopGear How do you have an LFA video that doesnt have an LFA exhaust note? Bad form.
TopGear Well that was dumb. If I wanted to see the specs typed out on screen I would search it on google. I clicked on this to watch a video.
TopGear WOW a top gear video I had to actually thumb down that wasnt top gear USA...or wait, it probably was.
TopGear Looks like a Celica ...
TopGear It s design is not the Japanese car
TopGear Its the best car Ive ever driven...I wonder which one Jeremy would pick if you lined up all the cars he says that about.
TopGear No topgear anymore for now? :( When will season 21 resume?!?!?!Or when will season 22 start?!!?! I really hate this season obly had 7 episodes...
TopGear I love Lexus man...the latest models of IS are just amazing...they seem to be the perfect mix between luxury, sport and extravagance...I drive an Audi now,I chose Audi just because the interior felt more manly than any other cars out there, if that makes any sense...I hope one day Ill switch to one of these...
TopGear Who in their right mind would buy this over a Ferrari or Lamborghini?
TopGear Again, its a bonnet. Cars havent got hoods.
TopGear the most overpriced car eva Drag Race: 2012 Lexus LFA vs 2010 Nissan GTRthe only thing it does well is sound good
TopGear Isnt the entire point of doing laps is to see how cars compare with each other? Why even bother doing a wet lap. Not like you can compare it against dry laps. Wet laps are as pointless as this video.
TopGear A 15 second preroll commercial before a 48 second video with all but no content. Thank you YouTube and top Gear. :(
TopGear This and the GTR are my dream cars. But this video was shit. I would be better informed by looking at a Wikipedia page than this.
TopGear Pretty slow compared to other super cars honestly.
TopGear So how the hell do you see the whole video?
TopGear 3.7 to 60 and 202 mph was good over a decade ago not so good now
TopGear Is this like some persons filmedit reel to get hired for top gear production? Here is a hint, put more story into it
TopGear Every time you show an LFA, dont you know u must at least make us hear that V10? The dashboard is mind blowing! With Toyota engine, this beast gives Germans and Italians a run for their money as its so reliable. But I dont own one and thats the sad part :(
TopGear Take a look at this video on YouTube:
TopGear Song name? Shazam doesnt wanna work :
TopGear 343k?? Wtf better get a Ferrari,Audi or something
TopGear Wow im reading like most of the comments about this car being superior to Ferraris and Lambos are you guys joking? Lets not forget the 458 with a V8 not a V10 makes more power than the LFA and revs over 9000 rpm and with a formula one gearbox with a much quicker 060 0124 mph and people bashes on us with again the old poor interior qualityexcuse? Someone just wrote one every 15 ferraris catch fire LOL thats funny only 5 over 1500 458italias did, but the fact that a Ferrari catches fire its the perfect opportunity to bash on the most powerful brand in the world lol unbelievable
TopGear Thanks for wasting my time
TopGear Overpriced piece of shit. dont waste your money.
TopGear This car is over rated, cars that are cheaper and from more prestigious companies out perform this car. It just sounds really good.
TopGear only 6 mph faster than a gtr but 4 times the price, gtr wins again on value.....
TopGear Im addicted to this video i watch it like 10 times a day
TopGear wonderfuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuul
TopGear i didnt see the engine?!?
TopGear The title is misleading, I clicked on this thinking wed go under the hood
TopGear LFA is so hot... Thats my kind of super car.
TopGear Under the hood never pops the hood. 3.1410
TopGear It cost as much as a lambo but the numbers are just not there
TopGear I would much rather buy this over a Ferrari or Lamborghini. 4.8 liter twinturbo V10 revs to 9000 rpm says it all.
TopGear Wheres the Under the Hood part.
TopGear And thank you...for designing me ol frs )
TopGear Absolutely love this car!
TopGear I like this car for being rare but in all honesty, its pretty slow around the track. I seen an all out battle on a track in japan (japanese racing video) and it got smoked by gtrs , vettes and other stock vehicles..
TopGear cheap grab for views ...
TopGear Georgeous but overpriced
TopGear The last one! Gold gtr!
TopGear Lack of cup holders. Do not want.
TopGear JAPANS CAR Is The Best In The World.
TopGear was told by title under the hood, so watched for under the hood view.. I was dooped
TopGear Gimme bck that 60sec of my life.49sec for this vid and 11sec for typing this cmmnt.damn you.
TopGear If Lexus would just utilize the exact same engine with a hybrid electric motor and a new double clutch transmission, the results would be intense
TopGear What a waste of a video
TopGear in my opinion, one of the underrated car in the world. loves the sound of its engine. perfect.
TopGear I would buy this over ferrari and lamborghini and this car not overrated by clarkson because it really is an amazing car made by highest quality japanese manufacturer in 10 years of development and clarkson have driven 10 times more cars than you do
TopGear a video of an LFA with no sound of the actual car is a travesty
TopGear Under the hood of my girlfriend: 300pound pieceomeat dere you go!
TopGear under power , very expensive, very stupid
TopGear Beautiful. Just beautiful.
TopGear Its neat, but nothing special in my mind. Especially for that kind of cash.
TopGear My favourite car to come out of Japan  the NSX is a legend  so was the driver that made it famous
TopGear Ask anyone who knows how to drive both (well) will tell you that manual transmission is more fun and engaging than paddle shifting. I personally feel that paddle shifting  automatics are only good for city driving because of traffic traffic lights and take away from the driving experience. May be Im too oldschool or maybe I enjoy driving but at this rate electric cars wont even allow you to drive but drive themselves and we just sit for the ride. Until that day I will try and drive a manual transmission car. Easier isnt always better.
TopGear Id rather get that Murcielago for 200k.
TopGear how could you manage to ruin this video so bad? stupid music misleading title
TopGear There is no way that thing goes 202mph. It only has what 500hp?
TopGear under the hood not 1 pic of under the cars hood...
TopGear Can someone send me a pink slip for this car. Thank you in advance.
TopGear One of my all time FAVOURITE cars.... its like a little rocket ship and screams up to 9500 rpm,,just a pure best..and also is one of Jeremy Clarksons fav cars   many things are wrong with it but its still the BEST car iv ever driven
TopGear Title of a video Under the Hood literally doesnt show under the hood.
TopGear Beautiful car. The only flaw...they dont make it in manual transmission! There seems to be an effeminate trend going on where all car manufacturers are making their sportier cars paddle shifting. I dont understand it but if I was going to spend that type of money I would want to drive my car and not just ride in it.
TopGear Looks like they went back to an old Celica for some of the design ideas and what is the idea behind the bonnet? The first time I saw one of these cars I thought they hadnt closed it.
TopGear ...     ,       )))))))      ,        !!!)))
TopGear Gimme bck that 60sec of my life.49sec for this vid and 11sec for typing this cmmnt.damn you.
TopGear Lexus LFA  Under the HoodMany things are wrong with it, but its still the best car Ive ever driven... Jeremy Clarkson on the Lexus LFA. The V10 engine in a Lexus LFA revs from idle to the red line in just 0.6 of a second.Thats so fast, the engineers had to fit a digital revcounter because a conventional needle couldnt keep up.
TopGear still look so beautiful...Roadsters are the best!!
TopGear Happy 700th video, Top Gear!
TopGear can we toss top gear USA out in front of the bulls and let them get run over?
TopGear The programs come in Japan! That s just too cool Lamborghini after all
TopGear 1:46 Someone tried to kill Hammond O.o
TopGear guess the work with VW did pay off for Lamborghini...hope it works for Porsche aswell :D
TopGear A rare breed maybe, but an old one now. This came from the last episode in Season 6.
TopGear When you put (HQ) in the title make sure the video is just that.
TopGear 2:34 Thats the song JP was listening to in his office in Grandmas Boy haha.
TopGear Can you make a review of the Ford F150 Raptor?
TopGear its so weird when you notice a car start to look dated..
TopGear and thats why top gear U.S. version sucks ass. Hammond had the balls to go into the bull event. No American Top Gear Hollywood Attention whore would have the guts to do what Hammond did. Thumbs up for U.K. Top Gear!
TopGear May I help you?Yes!You got one of these?No...
TopGear its a shame the original murcielago hasnt aged well at all :(
TopGear How can he see the road aheal?!
TopGear The normal model (no the roadster) is more beautiful than this.
TopGear Those are old chapters?
TopGear I love Lamborghinis because it is soooo beautiful and I am Italian but mostly because it is beautiful.
TopGear Only idiots take part, yet hes taking part too, lol.
TopGear Man I remember watching this like 7 years ago or something....thanks for the repost though, its a good episode.
TopGear Better than the terrible Top Gear US that they play here in the states.
TopGear murcielago was my fav lambo, but the aventadorreventon even got better
TopGear did I just heard only idiots take parts.??haha! funny then..
TopGear Hes right about the engineers. They need to piss off, and let the car feel and hear natural.
TopGear If I could just drive one for five minutes...my life would be complete.
TopGear stupid advertiser keeps popping out everytime i press the thumbnail anf all it does is loading aghghghg
TopGear This was easily one of the best tests they have ever done
TopGear The Murcielago is definetely the best sounding Lambo ever made
TopGear I think the name murcilago is because the side vents open up like bat wings at high speed
TopGear Hammond should called lambo lover
TopGear Not so expensive and yet more beautiful than many other exotics costing a hundred more than this one.
TopGear My most favourite car,more than a Bugatti and a koenigsegg. It has a extremely aggressive look, but with subtle lines, not harsh curves, so at the same time it gets the same feeing as an Aston Martin.
TopGear Love the Lambo, hate the Keystone commercial.
TopGear 1:58 look at that guys shirt on the back, number 69
TopGear Ah the old double exhaust murcielago
TopGear this channel is like DAVE.
TopGear Judging by the acceleration figures , Aventador might be the better choice in this bull run. Plus it is named after a real BULL!!!
TopGear Who else thought a Lamborghini should have been in the bullrun?
TopGear Aphex Twin Window Licker
TopGear I live near of the Bardenas
TopGear This thing still stops everyone when it screams by and always will!
TopGear The Murcielago is my dream car
TopGear I havent felt this alive since..this morning when i was chased by a bull actually. hahah!
TopGear unfortunately its discontinued.
TopGear activate this channel moreupload more vids
TopGear Can anyone tell what the music was at the first scene of the Murcielago?
TopGear RUN!!!!! the Lambos are coming!
TopGear Just by looking at the title, I thoguht Hammond was going to drive the Lambo in the Bull Run.
TopGear I really dont like this version of murcielago.Because we have the lp670!
TopGear Was hoping he would chase people with that XD
TopGear Viva espaa!! Y top gear!!
TopGear can any body tell me the name of the song plz...1luv
TopGear Murcielago... Bat... Most Lambos are named after bulls that got pardoned in bullfighting for being exceptionally brave, its like a a bullfighting hall of fame I guess. Diablo, Gallardo, Aventador, Reventn... All famous spanish bulls. They get to live the rest of their lives being carefully taken care of and breeding. That is why this one is called Murcielago, a bull that was allowed to walk out of the ring alive in 1879.
TopGear I wonder when they are going to get their hands on a c7
TopGear Yea he got one of that car last night in his dream
TopGear Thank you thank you thnk you for the vid!!!
TopGear 3.9 sec to 60 the zr1 does it in 3.3 and the z06 in 3.5 even the gt500 is faster
TopGear Italian car for a Spanish tradition?
TopGear Bahaha! That guy pulled Hammond in front to protect himself from the bull..!
TopGear Well done, cool video! : )
TopGear The only good looking Laborghini after the Diablo is the Aventador. Murcielago Gallardo baaaahh
TopGear Wow...just series 6...cant believe it.
TopGear ..So here I am!I died.
TopGear 1st generation Murcielago 3 Best supercar ever made!
TopGear what a stupid festival, even the banana festival has more sense
TopGear why didnt the lamborghini changed that roof converting process?
TopGear Lamborghini Murcielago Roadster  Pamplona Bull RunAfter surviving the famous stampeding bulls in Pamplona, Spain, Richard Hammond finds his next thrill in the Lamborghini Murcielago Roadster.
TopGear I remember when this came out... it was years ago.
TopGear I never understood that shit. I never will...
TopGear There can be only one Top Gear, PERIOD. Everything else is rubbish, Clarckson, Hammond and May ARE Top Gear.
TopGear and that concludes the road test of the car!
TopGear New RS7 vs E63 AMG Top Gear
TopGear this is YouTube GOLD!
TopGear next time put (in game) after top gear because this is not top gear other than the track, highly disappointed
TopGear Grande ottimo lavoro!!!Ma oltre alle puntate vecchie, metterai anche la ventunesima stagione?:)
TopGear Questa lavevo gi vista. C lhai quella in cui provano lalfa 4 c?
TopGear Puoi mettere anche le stagioni vecchie come la 567 che fanno crepare dalle risate? :D
TopGear Top Gear 18x02 ITA HD Prima Parte

TopGear TopGear Live Moscow 2014 http:ow.lyviI2p full show HD http:ow.lyviKBq
TopGear Non riesci pi a caricare i video di Top Gear? :(
TopGear Ragazzi scusate ma in che data sono stati a Roma?
TopGear La battuta sui semafori mi ha steso ahahahaha!! comunque solo in italia i vigili sono cosi bastardi!!
TopGear Ci crediate o no, io quel giorno ero a Piazza di Spagna con mia moglie, ed ho assistito a tutta la scena...la cosa bislacca  che NON LI CONOSCEVO ANCORA e mi sono avvicinato credendo fosse un film....ora a rivederli.....fantastici
TopGear I would like to see an episode of Stig  his cousins race each other, would like to know whos the SUPERIOR one. Come on TopGear make it happen please.
TopGear Kopfhrer aufm helm xD
TopGear Calvin Klein, Android, tough headsets, he has swag
TopGear The Stig even need to go to the toilet? How is impossible.
TopGear BBC cant make good shows and as one might expect, cant make good games too. Who takes a dump with the door open while being filmed. And what kind of a moron shows this on an ad.
TopGear Its Michael Schumacher
TopGear How many cousins stig has?
TopGear Only the Stig can take a dump so ethereal that it passes right through the racesuit.
TopGear How come weve never seen the Stig and his cousin in the same place?
TopGear you need to put cousin after teenage in the description
TopGear Why would a multimillion dollar broadcasting program like BBC need a shitty freemium game that sucks the money out of your wallet?
TopGear Since this account has a picture of The Stig, there should be an account with a profile of The Stigs teenage cousin. Just videos of Race the Stig.
TopGear for a second I thought this was going to be a miniseriesminisode of the comedic off days of stigs teenage cousin, but it ended up being an extended commercial. oh well at least its entertaining, maybe the games fun even though extended runners arent for me
TopGear I name this ship... Flush
TopGear What is teenage stig doing in toilet and with doors closed??? And with a tablet! Is he racing something else? Some say...
TopGear wearing headphone over helmet..now i see a true genius. haha..
TopGear some say...that the NO OF COUSIN HE HAS is equivalent to chinas population.and some say it is because other than driving he is an effective sperm doner.....all we know....
TopGear nice try but i am not downloading your stupid app.
TopGear Stig on that thug life status lol
TopGear Another Temple Run clone?
TopGear 500 likes 300 views, seems legit :s
TopGear He shouldve had a smartphone instead of a tablet, and some other changes as well... but I guess society varies and differs by country. Oh well.
TopGear why do they upload a video 23 times?
TopGear Probably Daniil Kyvat
TopGear Sluchtka beats mixr :D
TopGear Anyone noticed that the car review of the ford (from a couple hours ago) isnt here anymore?
TopGear 0:30 mine favorite place to play Race The Stig.
TopGear The game is absolute total shit!! Bad copy of subway surfers.
TopGear Unity game engine?Nice
TopGear Hahahaha. WTF?????!!!
TopGear Some say he can play the Game on iOS 5...All we know is, I cant.
TopGear Some say, teenagers cant afford fiesta STs as their insurance is sky high.

TopGear Some say ... That when not driving he is getting all the bitches.
TopGear todays teenagers... :)
TopGear Some say that he borrowed a lot of money to study art history and that he hasnt found employment for years...all we know is hes call The Stigs teenage cousin!
TopGear SiLveRsLidErZz you do know schumi is in coma right now?
TopGear At least I know he is a male, not a female.
TopGear His headphones are plugged into nothing...
TopGear LOL the low riding xD
TopGear how the hell do you make FF car drift? Oh wait, Stig! never mind
TopGear The Stigs teenage cousin  Pig.
TopGear Lets go bowling cousin
TopGear I have this on my Nokia Lumia 620 :D
TopGear Fake..Im the onliest Stig
TopGear Lol. Love the game. And that was so funny.
TopGear What a nice advert for the game lol
TopGear lol my boss plays that game
TopGear Funniest thing ever from TopGear
TopGear Stigs Teenage Cousin must have just got out of prison advertizing his ass the way they do in ((Prison))
TopGear stig has swag ? the stig created swag.
TopGear The games... meh, just another clone really. But this this add is 100x better.
TopGear Some say he knows 2 facts about ducks and both of them are wrong !!
TopGear non riesco a vederla intera, mi si blocca sui 10 min
TopGear bellissimo canale! volevo farti i complimenti!!
TopGear Complimenti per il lavoro che stai facendo
TopGear oggi si ritorna indietro? :)
TopGear Top Gear 18x01 ITA HD Prima Parte
TopGear Pensi di mettere anche la 21 stagione????
TopGear La differenza tra noi e gli inglesi  tutta in questa puntata. Amen
TopGear ho finito ora di vedere tutte le stagioni che hai messo sul tuo canale. tutte fantastiche continua cos!!!!!
TopGear fantastico continua cos
TopGear 0:46 Brakuje tylko strzaw i palenia gumy )
TopGear Amerykaskie V8 bezsprzecznie wygrywa. Bulgot gotowania zupy najlepszy.
TopGear Looks to be a computer game
TopGear Check out the E63 AMG around Top Gear track
TopGear Well, when the oil run, well have had to find a replacement for every oil and gas power plants as well.
TopGear its good, and to be honest range is not the strong point of any supercar.
TopGear lol so much post production in there that it ends up looking like an animation
TopGear And yet its competitions are trying to perfect theirs .. Like BMW ans Audi
TopGear When we or if we really should ever run out of oil, than one can make hydrogen surly its better than batteries it doesnt have to deal with short life time and long charge times. The reason hydrogen is not so populair is probably because is highly explosive and if every nut out there would have it it means government or better said people running it could face the consequences of being corrupt lol . But there are buses and boats that run on hydrogen. There are theories that oil is also produced through different chemical reaction than thought in your basic chemistry , therefor the production of oil is faster than those old school theories.
TopGear 1:56 totally fell for it. gotta love Mercedes
TopGear i couldnt help but just drop my jaw at that car holy shit!
TopGear the speed machines will live on! :)
TopGear From today onward, I will never accept a drag race challenge from someone who claims he will race me with an electric car.
TopGear I just wonder where you could buy Black Series SLS. I cant find it in Mercedesbenzs homepage.
TopGear I dont think this is the future. I think hybrids are, a small economical petroldiesel engine providing power to a much larger battery.. as seen in F1 (ERS) or the McLaren P1. Problem with fully electric cars is the longevity just isnt there and wont be for some time.
TopGear without oil the earth can only support 2.5 billion people, fun fact.
TopGear But now my electric bill will skyrocket...
TopGear Oil will never run out Jeremy!
TopGear Jeremy is perhaps the best presenter in the world imop..
TopGear Also this is not the first electric supercar, there was one before this but it never got marketing and couldnt sale. You can youtube electric super car and youll see it.
TopGear I am a serious racing car, Englisher!! Dont drive with your clown shoes on!! gotta love his German accent on that one XD
TopGear Hybrids and Electric vehicles. Why do they have to come in hideous colors andor designs? I mean even affordable sedans and SUVs that are available in petrol and hybrid versions have quite a few differences between them the hybrid being the uglier one with ugly tail lights and ridiculous decals and badging.
TopGear Proof that electric vehicles can and will deliver In performance and power.
TopGear its like the new f1 cars! cant hear a damn thing lol
TopGear You must be soft in the head for wanting to buy the faster car? I thought this was Top Gear?!
TopGear Science will find the answer. Supercapacitor batteries are already being made and it wont take long before its perfected. These cars wont have any trouble at all going long distances on pure electricity
TopGear 6:27 Deadmau5 Superliminal. Incase anyone was wondering :D
TopGear and it beats the petrol powered car?
TopGear What in the name of god is powering this thing? A thousand German souls.
TopGear Turn up the volume on your TV, and listen to this... silenceROFL
TopGear Im more curious as to why they would paint it in that ghastly green?..
TopGear Would you drive a Mercedes now?
TopGear If theres wireless phone charging, you can bet there will be wireless car charging, if not battery swap stations.Electric, petrol, diesel, hydrogen, or biowhatever, there is enough information out there that its actually up to the consumer what they want to power their vehicle with. The technology is here, has been for a while.Petrol heads will continue to burn oil, and speed demons will continue to find a way to go fast regardless of the fuel source.
TopGear First ever electric super car was Rimac ConceptOne with 1000hp. Just so you know.
TopGear too late Tesla Roadster is the 1st battery powered super car.
TopGear lol high visibility jacket
TopGear Oil in brunei cost 0.53BND per litre, thats 0.407USD. Diesel is way cheaper at 0.30BND per litre, so its around 0.230USD. 1 litre of water bottle cost either 0.50BND or 1.00BND. So thats 0.38USD or 0.769USD.
TopGear Dear Top Gear, i reckon iMercedes owe me an old Black.I have sorted out the battery range dilemma.Firstly trailers can be towed BY any iMercedes.Trailers can be any size.Replacing consumer envy and anger for petrol with just an oversized car trailer.So the media and advertising executives will be happy.The trailer will carry,SOLAR PANELS, enough to supply a domestic house or recharge in continuity a iMercedes.With enough amperage charge to allow the iMercedes to work all night long.The extra sized trailer can also work as an advertising bill board.Paying for the car.The excess power when not needed i.e. when parked can be sold back to the power companies also paying for the nights meal or lease on the street parking.Ideally the engineered trailer when parked would double as a street or off street car garage etcAla batiman engineering.Yeah thats way to hard eh.Regards Peter.Nice change of pace.
TopGear Amazing the future electric car
TopGear Check out the docmovie Pandoras Secret The future of speed is electric and I hope we arent going to burn coal to charge our toys.
TopGear VW needs a super car to compete with this
TopGear Mercedes just lost a small bit of my respect
TopGear I like the sound of an engine... electric seems dont know.. boring...
TopGear ILL take the V8 anytime, I dont think electric Cars are gonna be perfect, at least not for now, and they are also too Expensive.
TopGear Wen gas runs out Ill make more for the actual cars not those stupid plug in remote control cars
TopGear Im sorry but that Mercedes is ugly. I prefer the sleek body lines of a Corvette or a Lambo.
TopGear Electric cars and nuclear power are the way of the future. People dont seem to understand how safe nuclear power is theres only been 1 nuclear accident with loss of life in history (Chernobyl). People are so scared of radiation, guess what, people receive more radiation from the sun, from xrays and CT scans, and probably are significantly more likely to get cancer from breathing in the crap thats in coal and other fossil fuels then they probably ever will from Nuclear power.Problems my ass, nuclear will last for a very long time, is several orders of magnitude better for you than burning gasoline, and electric cars will be there to use the single source of energy with the best safety record when they make it.
TopGear One just does not buy a Black Series, he orders one and wait until it is crafted for him. Then he can release its wrath.
TopGear let me beat that electric SLS hold my beer i get my jet.
TopGear I wonder if more people will get hit by cars when electric becomes standard because they wont hear it coming
TopGear no petrol or electric super car will ever match the true power of a warrior: a simple bike :((((
TopGear Why not charging it while it goes? There are dynamocharged electric things, so why not making something like that? Wheels are constantly spinning, so here is the energy :)
TopGear lol the electric Mercedes sls dosent make a sound
TopGear Where will the electricity come from? Thats right. Either nuclear power stations or from fossil fuel burning power stations, which both pose huge problems. Either way the worlds problems are still unsolved.
TopGear And now its has 20 battery left... Gotta plug it into a wall charger
TopGear This doesnt feel like anything Ive ever driven before. It feels twichy and nervous. It feels like a ...Can anyone help me? I dont understand him in 6:10Thanks
TopGear 5:47 When it feels like you have engine braking, you do... :) Electric motors brake the car meanwhile generate electricity.7:21 Its irrelevant with a supercar. Buying one is a titanic waste in the first place.
TopGear Top Gear has obviously never heard of Rimac Concept One electric supercar which has range of 600 km on a single recharge.
TopGear electric cars are cool but the sounds are not.. :)
TopGear I thought the first electric super car was the fisker karma
TopGear Electric super car? Mercedes is mad
TopGear Gimmy the petrol sls anyday.
TopGear Another reason why its the BEST or nothing. MercedesBenz 3
TopGear yeees yeees, it iiiiis feature
TopGear Petroleum Companies would love to see those Electic Supercars Disappear
TopGear Mercedes  Perfection!!
TopGear oh snap...sounds to me like the old dog likes an electric....
TopGear I live in uae I have sls electronic it is realy fasst I win ford gt 500
TopGear nice videos top gear company
TopGear This thing shall gone dark when jit by EMP
TopGear H E M P ! renewable, higher octane and would suffice the fake manmade global (uneducated) warming nuts. Electric cars destroy the environment through mining  disposal of neededused battery products. Nothing will replace internal combustion power, only stupidity.
TopGear LOL, copy of the US car show Top Gear.
TopGear 6:30 Superliminal  Deadmau5 333
TopGear More of the future, Watson!Petrol vs Electric  Mercedes SLS AMG Battle  Top Gear  Series 20  BBC
TopGear I would never buy an electric car no matter how fast it is! They have no soul, great noise or anything, they are disgusting! The same goes for those filthy crossbread hybrids as well!!!
TopGear TopGear should drive the Rimac Concept One.Its an electric Hypercar with 1,088 hp and 600km of range and costs over 585,000.88 of them are being produced this or next year.
TopGear electric is best but as always the damn thing goes flat , dont understand why they cant come up with a way to make it self charge while it drives .
TopGear The only real problem with EVs now is battery tech. Once the energy and power density get comprable with petrol, petrol is technically obsolete.
TopGear surely mercedes made the petrol version slower on purpose. mercedes must be big on propaganda hype for the electric now. the fastest cars arent electric. as much of our electricity comes from burning fossil fuels and the fuel is transported using tanks running with petrol etc its not exactly any better. they really need to get those super charging batteries (few mins) ready soon.
TopGear Approaching ... approaching .. APPROACHING  !!!!!
TopGear what people dont understand that electricity doesnt have to necessarily come out of coal power plants so all and all electric cars would be better for the enviroment
TopGear expensive, impractical or whatnot, this is just another step towards the oil solution
TopGear Worlds first electric supercar? 918 and P1
TopGear Did anyone see that the license plate says SLS
TopGear grazie, sei un grande per tutti gli episodi che hai messo!
TopGear La crisi di astinenza si fa sentire, necessitano nuove puntate! :)
TopGear Io non avrei scelto la golf, pi che altro sceglierei una vauxhall astra techline 1600 che costa 21 mila euro, e con gli altri 6mila risparmiati andrei a fare una vacanza per incontrare quei tre di top gear e prendere la loro astra techline

TopGear I hope they wont ignore one:1 like they did to the Agera R.
TopGear Dewbauchee Rapid GT :P
TopGear Its nice looking and has the british feel but honestly, its not worth 195. Not even close. a GTR can kill that thing and it only has a V6 turbo. Step up the game AM.
TopGear This Aston Martin is damn sexy...like every Aston Martin xD
TopGear Stig just stands there like, I dont care.
TopGear Unfortunately, Top Gear UK really overglorifies their automakers.
TopGear Blue convertible went past my bus stop today, so nice
TopGear can you do reliant robin next?
TopGear Hood? Whats a hood?... :P
TopGear The beauty of Aston resides in that exclusive dashboard.And the thing I like the most is the anti clockwise aluminium revolution rpm meter! Its so unconventional and it excited me so much when I drove a rented one!
TopGear If I were really wealthy. This would be my sports car of choice. Not a Lambo, not a ferrari. Theres a certain elegance to Astons thats just amazingly sexy to me.
TopGear 6L V12 only 517 bhp?? And 060mph only 4.1seconds?? Thats very disappointing.
TopGear Wait a minute.... Didnt Aston also use a 6.0Litre V12 for the DB9 and the DBS and the Virage and the V12 Vantage and the old Vanquish? Dont tell me that the engine in the new Vanquish is the same basic one you got in the old Vanquish....
TopGear Anyone knows the name of the music?
TopGear Which track is this?Musicwise, I mean. :)
TopGear Woh! a Gold GTR. thats little crazy!
TopGear People who say 195,000 GBP is too expensive dont really understand the reason why people buy Aston Martins. My dream car is the Vanquish Volante. Yes, they are not as strong as Ferraris or Lambos, Id buy it simply because its emotionally beautiful and powerful. Power, Beauty, Soul
TopGear The Stig at the end..killed it :))))))
TopGear i like music very like please give me that music ()
TopGear We dont compare an Aston to a Nissan gtr its greater performance simply bares no relevance .
TopGear I was waiting for the Under the Hood Part...
TopGear TOYOTA CELICA FULL BODYKIT MODDED SOUNDS AWESOME
TopGear Wait, Not for 1 second in this video did we see under the hood... I wanted to see Under the hood
TopGear Tired of the HP supremacy junk. So much more to a car that just that.
TopGear This car is breathtaking...but is way overpriced at 195000 pounds
TopGear telling us the name of the song would be great
TopGear somebody please buy me one :)
TopGear its not a 6.0 V12!! its a 5.9 V12. it as always annoyed me.
TopGear Awww poop. I got all excited I thought they were going to actually show us what its made of
TopGear Take a gander at the new Camaro ZL1 or the Z28. More HP and less .
TopGear This car does not have 517bhp... It has 565. Cmon Top Gear youre meant to know these things.
TopGear Isnt the engine just 2 ford 3.0 v6s stuck together?
TopGear To be able to see the Top Gear Trio in my country seems impossible. Maybe someday this small Indonesia will be visited by Sir Clarkson, Sir Hammond and the famous and elegant Sir James. Someday. :)
TopGear Someone knows the song ?
TopGear Aston martin is a luxurious car.. but when it comes to power its the powerless between other cars
TopGear Under the hood?Glasgow?You didnt drive that car round Pollockshields did you?
TopGear Top Gear youre awesome youre the best Motoring show the world and my most favorite show hope to see more and I hope you will continue doing this for a long time sincerely
TopGear Its good but..... gtr is better
TopGear Does anyone know the song?
TopGear i had to watch a 30 second ad to watch a 41 second video... this is my life.
TopGear One day.... One day....
TopGear thought it had a 5.9l engine not a 6
TopGear umm, it has 565 hp, not 517 hp
TopGear The ford Taurus looks like this of course this dime came way first.
TopGear You guys are missing the point. Sure its an Aston and they are supposed to go fast. But leave the audacious BHP and 0to60 Times to other auto makers. Its about style and everyday driving comfort. Its how you get to your destination not how fast. Thats the name of the game in this beaut. Its refined from inside out. You know its an Aston prob bc you can hear that sexy exhaust note from a mile away. Yet the driver is tucked away nicely in the comfort and quiet cockpit. Dont compare GTR Corvette or even a 911 GT3. Completely different cars. Top gear has it dead on. Stigy. Btw when was the last time any of you drove a 4 sec car? We look at these numbers and stack them up to other cars without even experiencing them for ourselves. If the Aston has a v12 that has 517 or 565 bla bla bla so be it. Still faster than you will ever need.
TopGear Superb. I can go and play top trumps in the pub now.
TopGear Im gonna steal it :D muhahahaha
TopGear Does anybody know the name of the song?
TopGear love this car so much :)
TopGear this video was such a waste of time to watch...
TopGear Omg, I bet this video was made by alltime10s...
TopGear 5.9L V12 but I still love it.
TopGear Well thats enough porn for today.
TopGear Steering wheel looks outdated
TopGear Im sorry i like the Aston, but for that kind of money i would rather buy a Ferrari 458
TopGear Unlike American cars which sport a sqirt bottle of Skank Begone.
TopGear Every Vanquish comes with a free can of pussy remover in the glovey.
TopGear Minchia ma la spagna  messa peggio di noi!!
TopGear Sei un grande!!! Ti ringrazio
TopGear Sei un mito.. grazie di cuore per questi video, mi ero stufato di rivedere ancora una volta le stesse puntate su DMAX.
TopGear lol sigla di assassins creed e grazie x queste puntate, continua cosi
TopGear Grazie per i video che carichi!
TopGear Top Gear 20x03 ITA HD Seconda Parte
TopGear ThrowbackThursday SushiVSBurger
TopGear They got the gay mustang
TopGear Before you say this isnt fair, remember how american TG raced the slowest Ferrari against that Cadillac.
TopGear Also I like how the Lotus is a triumph of British engineering even though it has a Toyota engine.
TopGear I love that little lotus. Why dont more manufacturers take out all the heavy electronics on luxuries or do it for a particular lightweight model of the regular model? Imagine how much faster the 86 triplets would be if they made a light version where they took out the AC, leather seats, power windows, rear seats etc. That thing might be as quick as this lotus.
TopGear Sushi vs a Hamburger.. I see what you did there!
TopGear comparing these two cars is like comparing a sprinter that runs 100m races to someone who runs 8000m races
TopGear American cars and European cars are better than each other AT DIFFERENT THINGS.
TopGear Maybe not quite fair to compare the Exige to one of the worst drivers car on the planet Stig or no
TopGear I dont know why. but I dont like Lotus at all. its a good little car thoe
TopGear british engineering my ass . Toyota motor , Mitsubishi suspension ,and parts from other manufactures , sound like a parts bucket
TopGear Exige also cost a lot more then the mustang and has like no creature comforts
TopGear What bugs me with top gear is that when it comes to American cars (particularly the mustang) they always seem to make it slightly unfair, for example using a older, lower powered, heavier mustang against a small lotus in a track race. If theyre using one of the best cars lotus has then they should have one of the best mustangs, the shelby
TopGear Even when I was playing need for speed most wanted I never had to hit the breaks when using the lotus even at max speed.
TopGear Now, dont get me wrong, I absolutely adore American muscle, but this race was lost from the start. I mean, you picked a Mustang? A Mustang GT? Against a LOTUS?! What did you think was going to happen?Sure, Mustangs perform a bit better than your average sedan or coupe, but they are by no means a sports car. Theyre a sporty car. They were actually designed to be Muscle Car Light, so that they could be marketed towards female drivers. Unless you get into the much higher price ranges than a freaking GT, youre not going to find a good sports car unless individual modifications have been done to the vehicle. But not many people seem to know that, and I blame Ford for that (thats part of why Mustangs always leave a bit of a sour taste in my mouth).The Lotus was born and bred to be fast above all else. This wasnt a competition.
TopGear You guys hate on America to much
TopGear I wonder if they retested this experiment against a new 5.0L stang. Something tells me it wouldnt end the same.
TopGear 4:22 the stig on the stang?
TopGear try a 2015 roush mustang vs lotus
TopGear Michigan is pronounced Mishigan
TopGear Lets see it up against a vette or a venom not a muscle car
TopGear The Mustang is a heap, looks and drives like an old man. one of many embarrassments to the human race
TopGear The point is: power and big engine doesnt mean everything .
TopGear First of all why would you race it against a mustang?? The mustang is a muscle car not a sport car like the lotus. Yes it may have more horsepower or torque but it is also more heavy than the lotus. I would of preferred if you had raced it against a corvette or something similar to that. I have a feeling that TopGear only makes fun of the American vehicles by putting them against faster cars instead of actually facing them with cars that are as fast.
TopGear lol 1:55 you can see a part of the race before the race actually happens (mustang behind the sign). GG editing. Not bashing, just pointing it out. love this show.
TopGear comparing with a 10 year old car  fail.
TopGear Shelby GT500 vs. Lotus Exige
TopGear Show me a car that the Mustang CAN beat and I will laugh at both of them.
TopGear Ford Mustang. Bloody useless car! A people carrier can go faster then that shit!
TopGear 126 dislikes equals 126 mustang owners!
TopGear so many butthurt Americans crying in the comments section.
TopGear Lets see it vs the shelby lets see who wins
TopGear dont buy this shit, anyone who knows their cars can see that this is an unfair comparison
TopGear Its an unfair comparison, and they really played it off like it was a challenge and a glorious victory for the Lotus, which is what makes me mad. Oh and that comment at the end about using this test to justify British cars being better the American cars.
TopGear Mustangs are poorly engineered, plain and simple. Doesnt matter how much horses or how big the V8 is. Place a V8 engine in a couch. Add wheels, you have a couch with wheels!!!
TopGear The only American cars that would have had a fighting chance is the Ford gt or a late model corvette. Mustangs can be very fast in a straight line but that live axle kills their handling
TopGear As nice as it is to own a mustang, for me, its gotta a 67 mustang or a Shelby ortherwise no thank you! Id take a Lotus cause well for one its gotta a toyota engine  a million times for reliable than a ford engine, plus its just faster and you get more heads turning! Mustangs are just overrated above all other cars
TopGear Haha its a toy car and I want one
TopGear u put it up against a regular mustang try putting it up against a 2014 shelby gt500: 060 in 3.5 seconds, 662 STOCK horse power, top speed is 200 thats a definate win for the shelby
TopGear what are u trying to prove when you race a lotus like this against a mustang?? what is the challenge?
TopGear As Clarkson has said many times, American cars are rubbish. They are only good for going fast in a straight line and nothing on them fits the way it should. My BMW and I agree with him.
TopGear Jeremy there is new Lotus Exige S go and test it!!!
TopGear did u guys use the smallest mustang motor u could find wtf???
TopGear Haha, Triumph of British engineering! Havent heard that in a 100 years...American crap vs. British crap
TopGear The should have put a Ford Mustang Cobra against the Lotus. British engineering the Lotus is not. The car is a put together. The Mustang is from the ground up engineered in America. Jeremy is too biased.
TopGear Give that mustang a modern suspension and it will smoke the plastic car
TopGear The only real American car that can compete with Ferraris, Mclarens etc, is the Viper. Granted it is NOT a sophisticated GT like an Aston or a Merc but when on the track it can keep up and even beat them (Mazda Laguna Seca fastest time for production vehicle) PROBLEM IS that in order to do that you need to be an EXPERT driver to get that time
TopGear The Top Gear track was originally a Lotus track. Of course it turned out this way. Lotuses were designed to excel at turning. Mustangs were meant for drag racing.
TopGear They should have tested it against the Leguna Seca edition of the mustang.The Mustang is in a completley different category as the Lotus is, Mustang isnt designed for corners stock from the factory, the lotus however is. The Leguna Seca edition IS however...
TopGear The mustang is way heavier, thats why the lotus beat him..
TopGear 2:41 Detroit, MiTchigan
TopGear LOTUS  Lots Of Trouble Usually Serious (for other cars) :)
TopGear Cant really knock lotus for being unreliable, considering ford just dropped into the bottom 5 makes for unreliability. Lotus isnt even on the list. Also, this video is from 2006. Ford may have better versions of the stang now, but lotus has upgraded as well...
TopGear Detroit, Mitchigan. lol
TopGear Not a very good comparison. Those two cars arent really direct competitors. Id take the lotus but it does cost twice as much.
TopGear Should have tested your lotus against the stingray.
TopGear Was that a Concorde at the end of the vid?
TopGear 1:20 is that a concorde or something
TopGear A shelby gt500 will smoke the loutus
TopGear the Mustang :ils my life ! :)
TopGear That Hotel California BGM.
TopGear American cars are pretty nice now.
TopGear So the lotus weighs how much and has only 50 hp less, hardly a contest, another120hp on the Mustang and things would be equal. The lotus weighs almost 900 lbsless ( 4 Jeremy Clarks) try that out.
TopGear Its a British... Sushi?
TopGear Now if only it didnt look like shit...naw Im kidding, slap a turbo on that lotus, drop the ride height, maybe widen the bodytrack, and you have a car which can go toe to toe with anything
TopGear That style Mustang was so nasty. I have a 5.0 now... but only because of the changes, I never liked any of the retro crap Ford did. I never liked how doggy they made their cars when we had the 93 and newer Fbodies as an alternative with great looks and amazing LT1s and LS1s. The 2015 Mustang is going to be even better, and what does Camaro do for 2015, they take away the cool tail lights and give it granny tail lights because they gave the Stingray tail lights that maybe had a 5 similarity to the cool Camaro tail lights. Oh yea this was between Lotus and Mustang.
TopGear The Mustang looks better , sounds better , its more luxury , its bigger , its just a better car. Get that stupid Lotus out of the track and when you find the first bump on the road youll destroy it , and youll pay twice the price of the car to repair it. Thats the truth , that little white thing is useless , and the only people that got Lotus cars are just fat british reach people that know that they are stupid cars ,but they want to say i have a british car ,and o love it!
TopGear I own a 2013 Caterham Seven280 and a 2012 Lotus Exige S. I am two metres tall weighing under 130lbs. LotusCaterham have been my favourite cars since I first drove one stunning Lotus Evora 22 when I was sixteen. Now that I am almost nineteen and ridiculously barmy, I can say in simple terms, Lotus is love. Lotus is life. Seriously, there are no such cars that can make me smile more than track day cars. Yes, I love superlight cars, but I diversified my interests beyond that. I also love the microcars like the PEEL P50 and crazy cars like the Dutch Carver One. Any kind of car that looks absolutely insane is my kind of car. I only wish I bought that bloody Evora when I had the chance...Answer to Sushi vs Burger?Fish and Chips
TopGear Jeremy Clarkson is just another smug fat headed prick who knows nothing about cars and hates the country that saved his from extinction, twice. What a stupid fat bastard. He compares GTs to pure sports cars. Perhaps he might be able to explain why his country does not have a single carmaker to call their own. Are all Brits such impossibly boorish buffoons?
TopGear This is a joke, a go cart with a supercharger against a four seater mustangenough said. Well,except for the wimpy 4.6 ford engine is in a heavy chassispound for pound, a very poor comparison indeed.
TopGear 3:42 is it me or did it look like when they showed the mustang behind the lotus the mustang was breaking a bit ?

TopGear this is an old mustangepisode
TopGear hahaha anything is better than a Ford, even if the stig is driving it
TopGear the guys were in the highly secretive topgear planning facility thinking of ways to shit on american cars. then jeremy thought oh gee why dont we put up a very quick, extremely impractical, overpriced lotus up against a mustang GT! sounds totally fair right?
TopGear Lol all those defending a crappy Mustang. Id take the Lotus in a second, yes its got few creature comforts blah blah. Use some shopping trolley ie. Golf for sensible stuff.
TopGear that was not fair ... mustang is much heavier

TopGear Top Gear 19x07 ITA HD Speciale Africa Seconda Parte
TopGear I sorta expected them to just dip the tent into the river, before actually lifting it ashore.
TopGear Its not the river Kwai its the River Kok
TopGear (reminder of the Africa special) Jeremy: Its always funny when James goes near water cause he always ends up falling in...
TopGear Ciao ma da dove le prendi?:)
TopGear Top Gear 20x01 ITA HD Prima ParteEcco la Ventesima Stagione! ITA HD
TopGear What city is this? If its still deserted Im taking a car there
TopGear id rather have the jaguar
TopGear Fast and furios real life :))))
TopGear What does he mean the car will dissolve if you drive it too quickly?
TopGear I would buy the Mclaren in a heartbeat...
TopGear 4:21 WTF?!?!?! ASSASSINS CREED 3 SOUNDTRACK?!?! :O
TopGear Damn right that Fezza is a little bit more special, but 0:11 ... OMG. That BLUE!! 0.oI know its not really right to have a Ferrari in any other colour than red... or yellow... or black... but one in that blue would make me so dang happy! )
TopGear No one expects the Spanish speed humpClassic...They should make a poster out of that.
TopGear AudiAudiAudiAudiNow which would you like? The ferrari. Lol
TopGear One of the best episodes right here. Street circuit, those 4 cars, and that Top Gear humor.
TopGear asassins creed 3 soundtrack???? when Jeremy drove
TopGear What happened to James? His face is soo round! Lol
TopGear God theyre looking old
TopGear Haha when jeremy is driving uts the ac3 theme D
TopGear Mclaren MP412c and Audi R8! Are truly magnificent cars Ferrari Has the looks!

TopGear My kid dream was owning an Audi, so guess what. R8.. u will be mine someday.
TopGear assassins creed 3 theme?
TopGear They say that the speedhump is very... inquisitive.
TopGear my favorit car is a Ferrari
TopGear Am I the only one who thinks its strange to hear the wonderful Lamborghini V10 noise coming from an Audi? Its awesome that they offered it with the R8, but it doesnt seem to match the character of the car for some reason. I think I prefer the awesome Audi V8 soundtrack to accompany the gorgeous looks.
TopGear Top Gear is da Best !!
TopGear I too would take the ferrari
TopGear Love the ending lol Ferrari is just king end of story
TopGear props to bradley cooper XD
TopGear The most perfect supercar in this day in age is definitely the McLaren
TopGear No one looks as funny as May with an Arai helmet on..... no one.
TopGear Id take anything but the Ferrari.
TopGear Audi R8. Hands down. Im just an Audi type of guy.
TopGear They are still using the wheel in the other side, D
TopGear These Top Gear Uk people are getting very old.
TopGear assassins creed 3 music lol
TopGear Am I the only one how noticed the Assassins Creed theme here?
TopGear Did anybody else notice that they used Assassins Creed 3 Main Theme while Jeremy was driving around in the McLaren?
TopGear Id actually buy the Audi R8 ..
TopGear How can such a large place with readytogo houses be abadoned? The financial crisis?
TopGear gotta love the assassins creed 3 music during Clarksons turn around the circuit
TopGear Tail slide.....I call that drifting
TopGear Ferrari 458 Italia is my favourite car. :DDD
TopGear Ferrari 458 Italia is my favourite car. :DDD
TopGear Nobody expects the Spanish speed hump
TopGear The episode has so much win cause theyre using the music from Assassins Creed 3 lol
TopGear I love this show, its one of my favorites! You guys are so funny, I love the special episode where you guys drove through Africa and went to the Nile. :)
TopGear Funny as every episode :D
TopGear Assassins crred music as jeremy goes around his lap? Nice
TopGear James didnt get lost!!!!!!!!!
TopGear incremental sheet forming
TopGear Definitely one of my all time favorite Top Gear segments
TopGear I know that Top Gear tends to use soundtracks from movie, but from Assassins Creed 3?A video game?I was astonished ..
TopGear Honestly Ill take...XKRS caz I think its the most brutal..And the best looking..
TopGear 3:06 where did those sunglasses disapeared?
TopGear Even if your not really into cars.. . The bbc Top Gear is a bloody good show to watch.. :))
TopGear Take the Jag, no matter what
TopGear most of these comments prove that mostly dumbass little kids watch these clips lol
TopGear thrilling episode. beautiful cars. this is one of my favourite things about top gear...
TopGear Funny how they discuss things and ended with...Ferrari..love it.
TopGear Circuito de Sir Francis Drake good one!
TopGear Yeeeeeeessss.. a.c.3 for jeremys run. Mind blown.
TopGear That is a dirty, dirty sound...
TopGear Jajajaj I really like your program and its comedy thanks
TopGear Hey thats not Bradley Cooper.
TopGear james may got into 3rd 0.0
TopGear Yes people assassins creed music is in the video not everyone has to mention it
TopGear Yeah you forgot that no one gives shit about your LA and that the world doesnt revolves around America
TopGear The big crash hit Spain Hard ! Those modern ghost cities are a Trip !! I want to move their ! I would never clean ! I would just move into a new house every week )
TopGear ASSASSINS CREED III!!!
TopGear Im surprised they all chose the Ferrari
TopGear This was some creepy stuff.
TopGear My favourite Ferrari of them all.
TopGear Circuit De Francis Drake lolol.So funny, i wonder if the Spanish see the funny side of it lol.
TopGear See 9:14. Not a very pleasing sight.. front left Tyre is about to burst.
TopGear hey, can somebody say name of intro song? pleasethanks
TopGear Top Gear is over again. :( Pleeeeease make at least 10 episodes. Or make 7, and just put the rushes (bits of the show that did not get in the show), such as all of the news and such into episodes or a DVD and call it Top Gear Cock Ups! :)
TopGear You guys need to announce when its the last episode of the series. Instead of my hopes being up the following Sunday.
TopGear Zalonka did they stop makin g episodes for season 21? I dont see topgear tommorow on BBC 2.. it would make me verry sad if they stopped already :(
TopGear Put the new stingray against the supercharged jag.
TopGear Hey Jeremy that bloke that got his gentleman sausage cut off and thrown out of the window of a speeding car, on the A1 should take a trip to Russia so he can grow a new one! See your show really is educational and provides public service announcements!Good on ya crack on mate!
TopGear Wait what its over again?? WTF. Jeremy didnt even change his name yet!
TopGear Last laugh is on James, I think. Considering that he loves Ferrari and owns one, he is probably the one who is going to review La Ferrari.(Now the only thing we need is the three of them going up against The Stig andor Sabine Schmidt in one of the best petrolonly cars and see who goes the fastest around the Nordschleife :P)
TopGear I cant wait for Richard and Jennifer to bring the P1 and the 918 down to the Top Gear track and see which is the fastest.
TopGear mclaren is spelt wrong in description
TopGear The Chernobyl episode was incredible, also Aaron Paul, best star yet!
TopGear So tomorrows episode will be the 2nd part of the special, and then therell be one more studio episode?
TopGear Hi Jennifer Now say you dont like Porsche again,
TopGear Hopefully by the time they do the Porsche v the McClaren, James can drive Ferrari the Ferrari, or even better, a road trip with the 3 cars.
TopGear after the socalled Christmas Special (aired in the spring, lol), when will the show continue?
TopGear I honestly was a little disappointed witg the special. It was a really cool idea, but some of the pranks were obviously fake, and after seeing those it sorta ruined the rest of the episode.
TopGear Chernobyl was boring. Anthony Bourdain was there long before these chaps.
TopGear Thank you guys, honestly, for bringing so much entertainment to me. I envy your jobs, despite Im sure they take their toll on your personally, but you all soldier on. Please dont die and cancel the show until after I pass on. kkthxbye!
TopGear not the best season and 7 total episodes, that just sucks. maybe you guys shold spend more time making Top Gear and less on shows no one outside of the UK can watch. I used to look forward to this show, now its just another Monday night show. And for only 7 weeks? Cock.
TopGear so is there one more episode after part 2 of the burma special?
TopGear IS there anywhere where I can watch all of top gear? I miss every episode because I dont watch tv, I just wait until it gets on to netflix.
TopGear my god i love these GUYs!!! awesome, awesome people.
TopGear 21 is one of your Best! Great job! Seriously wish u guys liked each other a little more, that way we could get more episodes out of a series PAlso, I want more focus on the Dacia!!!
TopGear Best... Show... Ever...
TopGear i thought they said that the p1 and 918 would go around the track in this series but if that was the last studio episode then when are we going to see it??
TopGear i loved chernobyl,,it was very interesting and what i was interested in!
TopGear im happy with this season and nice to see the new chernobyl sarcophagus coming along nicely
TopGear Must be such a dream job..
TopGear Hammonds attire was atrocious on the two part Christmas Special.
TopGear Did you have any side affects when you went into chrenobyl? What did it feel like?
TopGear Go to all the trouble of going down, growing 2 sausages hahahaha
TopGear I think they need to drive a new keonigsegg. Theyre such fanboys ofthe bugatti veyron that they wont drive a better car on the show .
TopGear They have the best job in the world!
TopGear Has anyone noticed how fat Jeremy Clarkson is getting?
TopGear jeremy needs to drive a hennessey venom gt. thats amazing
TopGear Top gear is the best tv show ever, i wish it at more episodesfor season.
TopGear Top gear is the best show in world
TopGear It was an amazing series!!! My favourite one yet!!!
TopGear How would Hammond know he wasnt in Chernobyl
TopGear I dont care what people say, I love top gear, its the best show ever!!!! but maybe they should get one new cast member just to shake things up
TopGear Well, somebody know something about romanian cars.
TopGear Michael Schumacher as stig :)
TopGear We need more manly shows with 3 guys that have amazing synergy. A DiY show. A video gaming show. Etc.TopGear cant be the only one that gets it right...
TopGear so thats it..?? After the 2nd half of the Burma trip, thats the end of the season? what, 3 or 4 shows..?? I remember the old days when they were 810!!!
TopGear the reason this show is still going is because cars are still being made and created every day so no matter what this show will never run out of ideas
TopGear Why the hell they have only 7ep season :( .
TopGear Series 21 has been really excellent. Cant wait for Burma part II
TopGear Chemistry. This is why this top gear is amazing. The hosts have chemistry
TopGear Something strange about them ,, what the reason of dressing up like that ..? Not good clothes
TopGear i personally think this is best season in awhile
TopGear can you put up season 21 in Australia please
TopGear Congratulations for another triumphant series. For twenty two when you race the P1 against the 918 how about inviting someone fast along as well?I was thinking Andy Frost and Red Victor III would show you just how fast you think those Hypercars really are(nt). All the best and break a leg for the next series. )
TopGear One of the best series theyve produced. Cant wait for that P1 vs 918 race.
TopGear Damned be the day this show ever stops filming. Keep up the good work TG.
TopGear James seemed so tired
TopGear I wonder what the Stig thinks about this series... Im very excited about his feelings :)
TopGear When will you put more series on Netflix?
TopGear I would like to see P1 vs 918 :)
TopGear they have a new stig the old one was micheal shummacer but hes in a coma ski accident
TopGear review the recent koenigseggs!!!
TopGear Spelt Mclaren wrong in description..
TopGear do like the older season, make like 10 ep or so.
TopGear The review of the Jaguar CX75 please... That car is mindblowing good in my opinion
TopGear There need to be more episodes per season! Only got into top gear this year (really) but I really luv it now
TopGear They realy love Dacia Sandero.:)
TopGear Oh serious just seven im in nz and we have only got to episode 4 or 5 stink
TopGear Such an awesome show!I mean honestly and genuinely I cannot think of anything else that is as good as Top Gear.Thank you guys for making an amazing show and being humorous and sincere.
TopGear Really enjoyed this series.
TopGear Id say that is the best season up to date.
TopGear Make more behind the scenes videos! :D
TopGear Zero0 automotive accomplishments...almost. .
TopGear was the McLaren scene faked?
TopGear The McLaren P1vsPorsche 918vsThe Sandero
TopGear During the Chernobyl part, Im half expecting:GET OUT OF HERE STALKER!
TopGear WHY MUST THIS SEASON END SO SOOON!!!!???
TopGear And Iv just noticed that 2 of the 7 episodes are the Christmas speacial.Its probably not a bad thing we only get 5 episodes with how bad things have got.
TopGear The Chernobyl episode was not faked but filled with radiophobic nonsense about it being unhabitable for 250 thousand years etc.
TopGear They need the LaFerrari :o
TopGear When does season 22 start?

TopGear The word heard sounds awesome in a Scottish accent
TopGear Shes absolutely adorable, shes like a little girl in a candy shop
TopGear Shes a great girl, charming as hell :) Hope she comes back as a guest, certainly one of the very best guest Top Gear has had.
TopGear Nice girl but accent is ruined all
TopGear My new favorite singer. I dont even like her music.
TopGear The lfa is a shit car Ill prefer to ride around in a taxi
TopGear True blue Scott there. hoho That accent.
TopGear Shes not smart her fathers are rich, what a pussy was yo get famefame
TopGear I watched it just for her amazing accent.
TopGear Dear Amy. Could I be your friend? :)
TopGear the only problem is...I cant really understand what she is saying sometimes
TopGear That looks like my gta 5 garage
TopGear A girl that loves cars! No need to ask for more.
TopGear So many beautiful cars.
TopGear i think im in love with her lol
TopGear Audi R8 V10 engine vs C63 AMG MercedesWhat would you take?
TopGear Blue Man Group would be really cool to mix into this show, I believe they would fit right in there.
TopGear 458 is one of the best looking cars of all TIME
TopGear WOT! you have just placed an order on 458 speciale wow. I had a crush on you the 1st time i heard your voice and saw you now im ready to marry you. You are my type of LADY.
TopGear The Blue Vanquish is my fav car by far
TopGear She is amazing.I want her in my house :)
TopGear Wish I could buy a 458....and order another one
TopGear Perfect marketing strategy!
TopGear Say burglar alarm in scottish accent
TopGear love her accent above all
TopGear Shes so adorable and her accent is just so nice to listen to! :)
TopGear Thats the thing about taking a super car ...theyll probably NEVER catch you  if you DRIVE FAST ENOUGH!...and if you DO get caught, just tell the cops Jeremy said you could take it.
TopGear TOYOTA CELICA VVTi STAINLESS EXHAUST MODDED SOUNDS AWESOME
TopGear I would love to hear her say Ferrari again and again... that accent is beautiful
TopGear She doesnt own them but how in the hell did they possibly get a f40 they only made 200 of those. Most extensive car in the room 15 mill
TopGear Who is Amy Macdonald?
TopGear Jarod Gould That is the top gear live supercar garage. She actually doesnt own any of them. She does say in the vid though that she does have a 458 and is getting the 458 speciale, but her 458 isnt that 458 in the vid either. as she said hers had nicer seats lol
TopGear Girl, Please stop talking cause I will go crazy if u keep talking. my god love your accent.
TopGear You people who cant understand her youve just got to listen carefully im an 11 year old from south Africa and I understood her perfectly.
TopGear Whats the orange car at 1:46?
TopGear that accent though , drives me cray cray, in a good way if ya know wa a mean
TopGear Im going to find me a nice Scottish girl.
TopGear I just dont understand her
TopGear Good Vid from a Top Gear Fan
TopGear But the best cars in the World are: Porsche, Mercedes, Audi, and BMW ! : right?
TopGear Too bad she cant go on full throttle
TopGear She has a great taste in cars!
TopGear I am in love with this woman! Her accent is brilliant. The Scottish accent is by far my favorite! Her car knowledge is on point. Her T.G. Episode is one of my favorites.
TopGear is there anyway to add subtitles to this?
TopGear Anyone else see the Suzuki Swift?
TopGear Near the end of the video when they were pulling the cars out, I audibly exclaimed OH MY GOD THATS A FERRARI F50 cheesy grin
TopGear She is gorgeous ! A very lovely Scottish lady, eh?
TopGear subtitles in english anyone?
TopGear I did not understand a single word, could somebody translate that to american please? (Im not even american)
TopGear Exclusive Supercar Garage Tour with Amy Macdonald  Top Gear Live 2014
TopGear People these arent her cars. This isnt her garage. Those are the cars for Top Gear Live, a stage show that they do in the UK. That is why it is a big tent and not a building.
TopGear I love the way she speaks, and how she loves cars, damn, shes a keeper.
TopGear Gosh darn her and her amazing accent, now I need to listen to slow it down a couple hundred more times.
TopGear Shes one fine looking woman. Talented too.
TopGear Sad how Ill never see one in real life.
TopGear grazie del tuo impegno
TopGear Quando la carichi la seconda parte??
TopGear sei un grande,,continua cos ,,GRAZIE !
TopGear Ma dove li trovi questi video?
TopGear So weird to watch the lap without jeremys voice, aaand across the line !
TopGear I was just waiting for him to say bitch.........
TopGear I suspect theres hundreds of hours of Gran Turismo behind this success. But he still had to drive it for realz ) Spoiler: He beat everyone
TopGear What a moron, what a drag
TopGear Hi Jennifer Now say you dont like Porsche again,
TopGear you hear that? he drove a Konaseg in Need for Speed :P he means Koenigsegg but he says it really weird
TopGear yeah bitch!!! speed.. !
TopGear I thought he wasnt good at driving and just acted, but i suppose that he actually is good at it.
TopGear Im still alive, anyone want my recipe?
TopGear cool guy and he knows how to drive.. nice!
TopGear Some say... if theres ever a MetallicA biopic filmed without the actual members in it... Aaron Paul would totally play Lars.
TopGear Sounds too artificial for me this man!
TopGear Koenigsegg Agera R  Swedish Power :D man I love that car :)
TopGear I Will pay for one of his  Yooo Bitcchhh !
TopGear Hes from need for speed movie
TopGear Casey Chamblin Yes we do pronounce the e in Porsche.
TopGear This should have been titled, Is Aaron Pauls Breaking, Bad?
TopGear Why dont you guys try out the Chrysler srt8
TopGear Why Aaron Paul doesnt drive meth lab on wheels on Top Gear track ?
TopGear My Bitch can only get better....Soon hell be Breaking Good(meaning less) and riding that apex like a doubleloaded crackpipe.....YeeHa!!!!
TopGear hes liek..sounds..so like high..dewd..ya
TopGear KoenIGsegg not Koenisegg
TopGear Is he bad at breaking? I dunno, Ive never seen him breakdance.
TopGear I think Jesse Pinkman looks less of a moron. Aaron Paul is one poor bastard on the other hand.
TopGear Good stuff. Go Aaron Paul. It is funny, that the producer is speaking in future tense, when ever these videos are published, after the show is broadcast. Lol.
TopGear KOENIGSEGGIGNIGSEGGGIGSEGGGG
TopGear Look at the piece of crap they gave him to drive. I wouldnt have stopped til it was ready for the crusher lol
TopGear 2:14 he forgot the reducing agent
TopGear Aaron Paul star of Breaking, Bad.
TopGear well doesnt he suck at turning the car lol. Constantly pressing the accelerator pedal when turning, its so obvious.
TopGear I actually hate Aaron Paul.
TopGear Not single mention of the wordbitch? Disappointing
TopGear Did he really just mispronounce Koenigsegg?
TopGear Jesse get back to work!!!
TopGear why did they choose him for this movie, he has no idea how to drive and his face makes me sad, i lost interest to watch the movie ((( bad choice NFS movie makers!!! he is wrong actor
TopGear some say that blue color on his visor is from smoking too much blue meth
TopGear you do know when referring to driving it is spelt Braking right?, i am hoping it is a play on words
TopGear Apparently his pronunciation for koenigsegg is spot on. I work with a few Swedes who say the first G is smoothed over, something like Konasegg.Same thing with Porsche..people call it PORSH, while most Germans dont drop the E. Should be porshuh.
TopGear Shouldnt that say braking?
TopGear He doesnt need the break paddle on my opinion!
TopGear Is Aaron Paul bad at braking....pun pun pun pun
TopGear Ohh boy that clutch..... drop it drop it dont slip that clutch!!!! Aaahhh cmon
TopGear Poor Stig. his life just became over, just like that. how awful.
TopGear I love the behind the scenes bits. Make more!!
TopGear Jesse, weve got work to do
TopGear NeedForSpeed is now showing in theaters everywhere! But first, check out the BTS clip of Aaron Paul taking the Top Gear Test Track.Watch: Is Aaron Paul Bad at Breaking?  Top Gear  Series 21  Behind the Scenes
TopGear I came to this video with grammarnazi mode fully engaged. There is no way top gear would make a mistake like that... Oh...
TopGear Did great, even on the wrong side of the car!
TopGear Yeah Bitch!! Laps and shit Yo!
TopGear no ones intrested in the time he drove the lap ???
TopGear Im sure youre lovin it, but not as funny as a thought ! missing
TopGear Its Braking Badly...Bitch!
TopGear I want to meet James May, Jeremy Clarkson, and Richard Hammond.
TopGear Supermarket Soire with Dr. Dick Pebis!
TopGear Are you proud ? (queen hello hand)
TopGear How much meth did he have? And why didnt he call u a bitch?
TopGear braking bad is awesome,Aaron Paul is my favourite actor
TopGear One of the two two things that Brits do better than USA. Cars and beer.
TopGear From cooking meth, to cooking tires!
TopGear It sounds to me that he doest know anything about cars besides the price
TopGear I did pretty well around the track guys...
TopGear Anyone else read as breaking bad? :P
TopGear this dude is such a jerk off.
TopGear Saw that Need for Speed movie yesterday. It was Awesome!
TopGear Ever notice how celebrities say everything is great.
TopGear I like the new reasonably priced car!
TopGear Looking forward to it...
TopGear I dont get how Amond was possibly going to win.
TopGear They know they have got the best job! haha
TopGear Gray Ahem British TV show, British spelling please.
TopGear Ill be Lufthansa: Sorry ze gate is closed. xD
TopGear Both the Ferrari and McLaren shouldve done atleast 200mph but I guess the weather and wind had a big impact. Because I know the Ferrari tops out at like 202 and the McLaren at 207ish. The Audi tops out of 190.
TopGear Supercar Runway Race  Top Gear  Series 20 BBC
TopGear Guys, now that youre old I think that the only thing I have to say to you is what an awesome life!
TopGear Top Gear is AWESOME!!!!! The BBC version of course!
TopGear Hi Jennifer Now say you dont like Porsche again,
TopGear You cant close the roof on the Ferrari while moving? That blows...
TopGear I dont understand at the last part. Why does Richard need to wait at the line where Jeremy and James can go 1st? o.0
TopGear He can only move one direction. Lol
TopGear Ferrari is amazing! I need more of this kind of video!
TopGear These cars work fine there but what if the gravity was lower?
TopGear I hope they do this with interesting cars in the future. The McLaren is sick, but the R8 and 458 are the most generic supercars ever.
TopGear I thought it was going to be slot cars
TopGear You have to love these guys how do they come up with these races LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear another episode of Top Gear and another proof why it has so many fans (myself included). just when you think theyve run out of ideas and it is going to be something predictable (like a simple drag race), they come up with the funniest and coolest ways to spice it up :)
TopGear They looked like toy cars in the thumbnail lol
TopGear Not that I come from Europe  but Europe looks so much cooler than the rest of the world. The World is beautiful and interesting and Ive been on 4 continents so far myself but  nothing beats Europe. So old, artistic, cultural and hi tech in the same time.Even when there was the Bosnian War in Eastern Europe  the soldiers hid in 1000 years old monasteries and fought at the Roman walls of Dubrovnik(Kings Landing from GOT). Damn.
TopGear Whats up with the sportscars and spiders?
TopGear Supercar Runway Race  Top Gear  Series 20  BBC: http:youtu.beDgjDMVRX0
TopGear pay attention ...they never put the 911 turbo s to compete with these cars ,cuz they know the Porsche will beat all of them!
TopGear I mean most of them in that fact......yes hurried and corrected my self haha
TopGear You guys have the greatest job in the world!!!
TopGear Why James didnt use launch control?
TopGear age has done little to damage to their brains i must say! they are still kids but with expensive toys.
TopGear Please upload the circuit race in the abandoned spanish city from this episode.
TopGear AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Jeremy is the best! :)
TopGear Looks fun to be 1 of them
TopGear Thank the Spanish government for this circuit.
TopGear Wooooo!!!! MCLAREN!!!!!!
TopGear Why didnt they buy an aventador
TopGear This humour and selfirony is just such a spectacular and distinct feature of the British. Amusing video in every aspect :D
TopGear This airport was made by corruption, its completely abandoned. So it can use like a track and top gear spanish version will be founded )
TopGear The audi still looks the best xD
TopGear I live in spain an want to know where this is lol I want a go does anyone know????
TopGear Oh yeah mclaren WOOO :D
TopGear Oh yeah mclaren WOOO :D
TopGear its like a toy cars in the thumbnail
TopGear The McLaren MP412C Spider is amazing!!
TopGear anyone else cringe when Clarkson was leaning up against the McLaren with his jeans on?
TopGear Because the ferraris roof can only go up if the car is stopped
TopGear Three Englishmen drag racing in supercars...The result being one guy saying hang on a tick chaps lets perform a bit of high speed testing on our roof mechanisms and the other two thinking its a spiffing idea. I think, given a runway and three supercars, most of the world would be happy going really fast and doing donuts or some shit but not three Englishmen.
TopGear why is the airport so empty i thought they are supposed to be very busy
TopGear Im zorry ze gate ist closed.Well could you just open it?Nein!Loved that part xD
TopGear Id still take the Ferrari
TopGear can you open it for me? James: NEIN  LOL
TopGear I live in America. Im only 11 but I absolutely love cars! I record every one of your episodes on BBC which is way better than the American Top Gear. You guys are just naturally funny! Just letting you know that you guys make me go to bed with a smile on my face.
TopGear Whats with the matching shirts? XD
TopGear aventador roadster xD manual roof lol
TopGear At wich airport is this?
TopGear Yes BBC version is definitely the best
TopGear Why is James and Jeremy wearing the same shirt?
TopGear You should try laferrari
TopGear the one who came up with that roof up and down race is a genius.
TopGear Noooo!!! The video ends before we can see Jeremys smug face
TopGear There was actully damage done to the cars they show you if you watch full episode
TopGear May  Im sorry the gates closedClarkson  Cant you just open it?May  NEIN! lololololololol
TopGear Those cars can reach VR of most planes.
TopGear The big crash hit Spain Hard ! Those modern ghost cities are a Trip !! I want to move their ! I would never clean ! I would just move into a new house every week )
TopGear at 0:12 james mays nein i dieeeeeeeeed laughing ... xD omg
TopGear why are jezza and captain slow dressed the same?
TopGear damn this guys have one of the luckiest jobs in the world!
TopGear the modern ferraris look to soft from the front except the f12
TopGear before I die I wanna an airport to my own and a supercar of my choice to have fun with, which is NEVER gonna happen. :(
TopGear If I had asked Top gear for a personal , specific video to be created for me ..it would be pretty much be THIS one as it is !Perverted Supercar Porn !
TopGear you know, ive got some unused items. my radio for example and some pens. but i dont have an unused INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT!!!
TopGear Top Gear 19x04 ITA HD Seconda Parte
TopGear all black ..very nice the dark sideHowever changing the channel name or bbc makes complaint
TopGear Ive been in this 3 cylinder crap and its horrible.
TopGear Great video mate, great video!
TopGear haha poor Corolla, with its rally gearbox, short ratios and 300hp, never stood a chance. However they all of those cars combined havent competed or gone half the places that car has gone. I admire that they choose it over many other rally cars from its era. Toyota Corolla Wrc the Legend :)
TopGear Nice video mate. WTAC car was very quick indeed.
TopGear Imagine if tilton were on slicks. For those that dont know they were on street legal tyres.
TopGear It was so much more exciting being there

TopGear I wanna race the stig!
TopGear I always thought the Stigs teenage cousin would have pimples on his helmet...
TopGear FAKE! Touch screens dont work with gloves
TopGear To be honest the app really isnt that good :(
TopGear Have you ever raced a Stigcousin against the real thing? Whos faster?
TopGear why have something awesome like the stig and use it for a stupid game .
TopGear subway surfers rip off
TopGear Oliver and hammerhead :D
TopGear Still better than subway surfers
TopGear We all know how awesome BBC is when its made available for Windows Phone.
TopGear awesome ad, terrible ripoff of a game
TopGear i got that game its good
TopGear Some say... he never stopped playing when he went for the hot lap.And, even at this very moment, hes broken the alltime high 50 times.
TopGear Due to the unique way the BBC is funded....
TopGear looks crap. add stig ghost car data to gt56 and forza and then wake me up.
TopGear It doesnt work on iOS even it says that

TopGear Oh boy, just what we needed, another temple run clone

TopGear from the title i thought it was a some kind of competition so i was so glad cuz i thoght im going to race The Stig
TopGear stigs are rampant. cousins everywhere
TopGear U guys should make a game thats not shit.
TopGear Hahah the headphones on the helmet.. of course! )
TopGear You guys should do a simulator app where you get all the cars on the power lap board and make a racing game where you can try and beat the real times or just race with a few friends going around the top gear test track. :D
TopGear 150 View :)Awesome video as always too bad we dont get top gear on TV here :(For some reason we dont get BBC
TopGear Petrol in their blood
TopGear The itself is awesome but way too many ads, I know its free but you dont have to have an ad every time you play
TopGear Season 21 has only been about hot hatches.
TopGear Some say he has the same Nexus 7 tablet as me :)
TopGear Such a good advertisement.
TopGear That looks exactly like Subway Surfer... Like, an uncanny replica actually
TopGear hes not wearing dre beats
TopGear so im waiting on the youtube advertising to watch another advertising..
TopGear Dont forget to enjoy this app on the weekend )
TopGear Some say he got acne....on his helmet
TopGear That is so cute. :D Teenage Stig with headphones. 3
TopGear wow, i wonder whos his girlfriend?

TopGear Work harder. Get a car.
TopGear TopGear Jeremy Clarkson Work Harder Get a Car: http:youtu.beMLr9vWGe8mM
TopGear Clarkson is a nob, cyclists stay in shape unlike fat drivers xD
TopGear Im not so concerned with rhe Rulebook on top speed either. But come on... First the SSC Aero which quickly turned out to be a homewelded steel tubular kitcar based on a Lambo Diablo replica kit. And now the Hennessey Venom GT which is built in England, modded in England and still running on Lotus paperwork, Lotus VIN  Chassis number and Lotus numberplates. Which is the only way its road legal at all. So please... Derek... Doesnt it ever get embarrassing to adopt modded Euro cars as american car icons. Such as the Ford GT40, AC Cobra.Wouldnt you like to see the might and manpower of the entire US of Murcas car industry, step up and actually BE competitive instead of just claim to be with kitcars and tuner projects ?
TopGear I was so close to comment or of the week :( lol
TopGear Very Good Episode!!!!
TopGear Oh my god. It is not that difficult nowadays, to do a very fast car.The rule of doing the speed two ways, is due to the fact, that you could have back wind or driving down a slight slope benefiting factors.And the production numbers? That means, that it is not, tuning one or a couple of cars to the death.The Venom is definitely ridiculous  actually in all ways. But isnt it really a crazy tuning project?Anyway I rather would see myself driving a Bugatti like a BOSS!
TopGear 150k for the gismo gtr? wow i was guessing a LOT more
TopGear Yo wheres that cute German chick? Yeah, Derek d, I dig your smile and like that hair part...but thats no substitute for da laDEs. ). Oh yeah, and kick as cars put your smile into third...Erikas voice drops you into fourth...hmmm hey fourth isnt bad...Love the show, great info, entertaining...thanks FLD team! Great production!
TopGear need for speed.....I hope the hell not
TopGear Ill get the Juan car instead which i can afford thank you
TopGear The rules are the rules and it doesnt matter because the ONE is going to stomp that piece of shit American scrap iron car.
TopGear How can the Venom be the fastest production car when its a stretched Lotus with a twin turbo charged V8? Granted its nice work though Hennessey could have done better by designing a car of their own besides taking a proven product along with a second attempt at this body style .
TopGear FLDQfromMe: When are we going to see an Erica Torque super cut?
TopGear nice erica, i like todays torque shout. keep them coming.
TopGear Get it to your thick skulls  Venom GT is not a production car, it has never passed any of the mandatory production car tests like crash, emissions, noise, pedestrian tests, it doesnt have all the mandatory production car safety features etc.They use Lotus VIN plates and register the car as Lotus since Lotus allready is a production car. Might aswell throw a dragster engine into civic and call it fastest production car.
TopGear At first I was going to call you out on the Nismo being more expensive than the 911 Turbo....then I checked the american Porsche prices. 148 000? Thats cheap it starts at about 170 000 here in Canada,with the Turbo s breaking the 200 000 mark. Damn.
TopGear The koenigsegg one is sick, a CLA ugly as shitttt. It looks like a bug. Sorry
TopGear FLDQoftheD I think its either gonna be redinky dinkulously fun... or terrible. Either way Im looking forward to it :P I think they (the hollywood powers that be) will try and make it into a FF franchise (cash in on his new found stardom  also the whole racing game following) however because FF had a smaller budget originally and was sorta a cult film out of the blue (the first one of course) it had the right attitude (story possibilities  cast) to grow into a franchise. Obviously now its got massively more redinky dink than it already was. It depends whether Need for Speed allows enough storycharacter for a franchise, he cant keep getting out of prison and exacting revenge for 7 films...
TopGear Is.... That should be in a rewind episode later this year.
TopGear Considering that the GTR is my favorite car, Im going to need new fucking eyes after seeing that GTR Convertible. To whomever created that monstrosity, fuck you!
TopGear demander11 same here the Nismo GTR is an ugly tuner car the 911 Turbo is a beautiful car
TopGear I seen a veyron go down my street but i got a Camaro rs which one is faster
TopGear ONE TO ONE? THE ONE???TO LOGO IS ONE:1IT IS KNOWN AS THE ONE ONE
TopGear it will be next Red Line..
TopGear what category you ask?? The DAILY CAR SHOW WITH SPUNK
TopGear DERECK D U TALED ABOUT DA NISMO GOOD JOB !!!
TopGear Theres gonna be the New SuperVeyron in the near future. There is still another chance to get up in over 270 mph Commenter of the week.
TopGear i dont think need for speed will be like the fast and furious franchise since it isnt as realistic. If you check the trailer youll notice the koenigsegg on fire.....which looks really like fake fire around the car. Now it might be possible for many other need for speed(s) since every year EA releases a new one.
TopGear The Vyron hit 273 point something but it didnt do it on the way back at the same speed so f u commenter of the weak. Thats why they have to do the run in both directions!!
TopGear I think its gonna be a ff franchise
TopGear its clear that my scrotum is
TopGear How in the hell can you say that the One:1 is ugly!! Dont think there is any awsome Super hyper car then the Koeniggsegg.
TopGear ...And Taylor has exploded.
TopGear It might turn into a kind of fast and furious franchise, but it will never be up there with fast and furious, because i dont think that the story will be as Deep as fast and furiouss story is
TopGear Dam Derick D youre giving women the D just by saying your name.
TopGear it seems your doing a hard job to make this show, but whats your earning from this ?
TopGear Oscars for FLD in ALL OF THE CATEGORIES
TopGear when did you record this? all of these happened over the weekend and today.
TopGear The price is  3,500,000.00
TopGear fast and furios is based on need for speed (the game) so why not havin a movie related straight to the game?!but the thing is that vin dieselpaul walker combination was pretty strong! so we have to wait and see the NFS movie, it must have a huge impact so it could go further!! cause we all gonna go and watch it but without the strong first impression were not gonna do it next time...

TopGear holy shit this host is a faggot.....
TopGear It doesnt matter the venom is not a production car it is registered as a lotus
TopGear Ha Erica almost said twerk instead of torque!!!! that was funny :)
TopGear Fast  Furious will NEVER, I repeat NEVER be replaced!
TopGear Id still take the 911 Turbo over the nismo GTR
TopGear That dbag can never replace Paul Walker.
TopGear The one sold for 2 million each
TopGear Hey just curious since I dont care enough to find out on my own. Is top gear America still running, or did it get canned? Cause it sucks compared to bbcs
TopGear any car that can only measure its top speed in only one place in the world is too slow
TopGear So we all know hes not on topgear next week...it was this past sunday...hes the fastest.
TopGear Hey FLD crew and audience. I know you all like race cars (I mean, who doesnt?), up here in Canada my team and I built one. Then we raced it on ice (btw huge fan of the show been whatching for years). I cant post the video here but if you search formula sae ice racing 2014 it should be the first link!
TopGear I have agera but not this one
TopGear i hate when people compare the veyron to the stupid venom and the agerathe veyron is LUXURY and speedthe agera is as noisy as a tight blonde pornstar (good looking) but noisythe veyron is in a different league. you have to respect good engineering from all companies
TopGear Please toyota built the next supra. I am sick and tired of the 13 year old fanboys of the gtr. Oh the gtr can do this and the.gtr can do that. Only true skylines are the r32, r33 and r34. The.worst thing about these idiots is calling people who buy 911 turbos, lambos, ferraris, keonigseggs, paganis, ascaris and other very expensive cars dumb or other childish names, big deal the gtr can do 0 to sixty in 2.who gives a shit. You are comparing a gshock to a fine time piece. In the real world there are more important things like excitement and sense of occasion. The gtr give me niether. Its a plasticky, numb uninvolving driving experience. So please build the supra so the gtr fan guys can stop pissing upwind.
TopGear False. Theoretically weight has nothing to do with top speed except that it increases rolling resistance which slows the car down but just by a tiny amount. All it does is it takes longer to reach that top speed.
TopGear The Koenigsegg 1t1 was ordered and built as a track car and not some tuning project like the Venom seems to be. The new technologies developed for the 1t1 will also go into the next gen Agera model. It even has 3D printed titanium parts to save weight. (And the 3D printing technology comes from another swedish company with customers such as Airbus, Boeing and NASA)Do not underestimate us swedes :)Cant wait to see some videos of the 1t1!
TopGear ONE OF, THE BEST, FLDs EEEVVVVEEERRRRRR!!!!! 12,000 thumbs up !!!!
TopGear QoftheD Im not sure if the NFS movie will become the next fast  furious franchise but Im pumped about it
TopGear KOENIGSEGG LOOKS SO SEXY AND ITS SO FAST! I LOVE IT!
TopGear He came on top gear yesterday
TopGear I am pretty sure the Hennessey is not a production car sorry americans
TopGear The one:1 is one of the best engineered cars ever. How can you discredit that car?. 2.8 million is a lot. But that much has been put into it. The venom GT on comparison is just looks and feels tuner car. Even the door on a koenigsegg is more complicated than the entire venom GT. And i personally think its a good looking car.
TopGear Why is the commenter of the week title image a silhouette of a cow???
TopGear FYI D squared , he already went on top gear and he was the fastest star in a reasonably priced car with a 1:44.7 seconds. Great show by the way.
TopGear I dont want NFS to go on nor do I think it will. AP doesnt have the philanthropical good guy charm that helped Mr. Walker win us over. Plus I think we need to go back to the lighter car porn movie era and leave behind the in your face every car desired ever xxx fest that plagues car movies currently.
TopGear flqoftgeD that movie looks cheesy as fuck and lame straight to DVD after a week
TopGear Derek D should be a star in a reasonably priced car
TopGear Qotd: its obvious that need for speed is
TopGear Id like new NFS movie to bocome franchise, because its still about cars and racing not like fast and furious.
TopGear Just saying that Erica has a sexy voice OK let her know
TopGear Venom GT smells ollon.
TopGear and i dont like this episode...D
TopGear FLDQoftheD: I think it will turn into a small franchise, but not nearly have the success of The Fast and The Furious. Not putting the movie down...hell, I havent even seen it yet. Just my opinion, also averaging in what Ive heard on the street what ppl think about the film already. Not saying its gonna suck a fat babys balls, buuuuuut....ppl are expecting a FLOP. I hope it does well myself. Awesome show 2day team. Great job as always!
TopGear That was the stupidest comment I have ever seen
TopGear For the GTR Nismo, the price is cheap for what it does. A 2013 GTR is way better and faster than a Audi R8 and its half the cost.
TopGear I think Need for Speed the movie is trying to become like FATF but i think they will do something wrong and everyone will hate the move and they will go back to making games :D
TopGear what amazes me is that usa is  the greatest nation on earth and has SHITY CARS!
TopGear Koenigsegg 121 yoMaybe the COW winner forgot theres no more limit to the length of comments haha
TopGear Bugatti Veyron is the fastest
TopGear Great episode, no bs, no bias, just the straight facts, why cant more car shows be like FLD? Great job guys, ohh and you did pretty good too Derek D...BITCH!
TopGear Yes I think need for speed will turn into a ff type of franchise because I have a feeling that it will have that eee........ kind of ending just like the first ff had and I think NFS will be a strong contend for a best movie of the year in my
TopGear Kiedy mylelimy, e Golf GTI jest wzorcem kompaktowego hot hatcha, Volkswagen pokaza wersj R i zburzy porzdek tego segmentu.TOPGEAR POLSKA:http:www.topgear.com.plhttps:www.facebook.comTopGearPolska

TopGear Best  Some Say... of the lot
TopGear One of the best some say!
TopGear hopefully piers morgan committed suicide when watching this
TopGear well... Clarkson said it as if he was proud. ahahahaha
TopGear I owe that man a beer.
TopGear the most glorious moment in Top Gear history.
TopGear Piers bashing makes me feel all happy inside.
TopGear Jeremy, you asshole ... MORE! MORE MORE MORE!! :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
TopGear Check out this video on YouTube:
TopGear A Volvo 300 is greater than 90 of the crap the British ever made.
TopGear I am guilty too. three weeks ago I drove my vw to subway for a sandwich, order a chicken foot long, toasted for those interested. I saw a xc60 in the car park and ended up owning a xc60R by the end of the day. Initially i thought the sandwich had been severely dosed with LSD, but three weeks on im still always look for an excuse to drive it. Well done Volvo im hooked.
TopGear Ive only recently fallen in love with Volvos... Fantastic cars, great engines, retro styling. Not your typical boyracer car but if you know what youre doing, really go like the clappers!
TopGear So much lip smacking.
TopGear I had a 92 same color I bought for 550 drove it 2 yrs and sold it for 800.... I like Volvos but the 1992 was the worst 850 !the 97 I drive now I bought for 600 and been driving it for 6 yrs now with 230k on the clock still going strong.....let some one else eat the new car cost and drive it for years on the cheap !
TopGear 2:06 you left your wallet in there sir !
TopGear I always imagine The Stig smiling up to both ears under the helmet after going for a few rounds
TopGear 620aaRRRRRR! for racing
TopGear Another expensive and silly episode thst left tg knobs stupefied and in awe. Wow! Behold, a motor, chassy and some form of coupe. Would you look at that. What a piece of ....
TopGear Wait what? James has a Mrs?
TopGear jumping geezus that looks like a blast
TopGear Damn the rain this year!
TopGear how many people were narrating the lap as the stig drove?
TopGear This is a car you really wanted to see what time it would get.. And its wet... Do it again? :)
TopGear James, its a track day car! DUH!!!!
TopGear Look at that little car hip hopping on the track. Id drive with a megawatt smile.
TopGear the original footage from that camera must be amazing
TopGear It almost sounds like a snowmachine.
TopGear The new Stig is Gordon Shedden.
TopGear Never knew James has a lady in his life
TopGear anyone else still think the latest stig is tiff?
TopGear For the guys out here who dont know, the old stig used to be schumacher but now he is in a comma, so they got a little teenager as the stig.
TopGear anyone else notice the stig had blonde hair leaking out of his helmet?
TopGear I see the 620 as a car you would keep in a garage and only take it out a few times a year and only run it on a track. The 160 is the car you take out to the country lanes every single weekend, give it a good thrashing, then pull in to a pub and have a steak pie dinner.
TopGear The stig seems a feminine this time. Chest at 1:15, lock of blonde hair at 1:27
TopGear Either buy a windscreen from the lesser Caterhams or put on a full face helmet. James is an avid motorcyclist and shouldnt really be adverse to wearing one in a car.I do however agree with him on the 160. That looks like fun!!
TopGear THAT sound! OMG, its pornographic!
TopGear Theyve got an interesting history if youre into that sorta thing lol.
TopGear Been in an R500. INSANE car. It did have a windscreen though, you can buy those separately. :D
TopGear Did the Stig miss a gear? 1:50
TopGear more raw track footage please!
TopGear Whats a Caterham thats sort of balanced between the two ?
TopGear Nothing but wet lol. Cool clip of the Stig getting sideways.
TopGear Watching the lap in 1080p is glorious!
TopGear Why didnt they record the lap on the day when they reviewed the car? It was dry then.
TopGear point, squirt....lots of noise, opposite lock, repeat!!!!
TopGear That 620R sounds amazing!
TopGear the The Stig  Fail, BBC 2014
TopGear That thing would have been near the top if it were dry
TopGear They should do a review of one of the latest Donkervoort Cars...theyre always complaining about the looks of an Caterham...Donki  Caterham gets beautiful...
TopGear I dont care what I look like, I would drive one to the pub.
TopGear Please release the onboard every week for his drives.
TopGear Please do the lap again in the dry! This was going to be exciting!
TopGear Schumacher was the STIG only Once , when they tested the FXX, because no one else was allowed to drive itSo he HAD to be the STIG for THAT episode.The usual stig is a British F3 Guy with some ex F1 drivers filling in when they get something really hot.
TopGear James, you could always just buy a wind screen from Caterham...could you not?
TopGear you can see the stigs collar 1:39
TopGear James has a good point!!
TopGear That looks like its better than sex...
TopGear did anyone els say AND ACROSS THE LINE to themselves lol..
TopGear Please check out my car video of the new Caterham AeroSeven concept: http:youtu.bedXqniLdKBkE
TopGear amazing gear shifting  Stig you are the best
TopGear James has had a girlfriend for the past 14 years.
TopGear One of my favourite cars in NFS:Shift 2!
TopGear it may be the fastest car on the track if the track is dry
TopGear It is called a helmet you wear it in kitcars
TopGear Impressive driving!!!
TopGear I just found out this. Top Gear may have just been on Phineas and Ferb :0
TopGear Such a nice soundtrack
TopGear 1:39 It can barely put its power down!
TopGear it sounds like an old rally car!
TopGear 1:15 does the stig has boobs?
TopGear Just great! NOT ! what was the time for the 620R, how did it stack up?Seems you video was a bit clipped at the end. Am i right???
TopGear if michael Schumacher was the stig... whos stigging now?
TopGear Ohhhh...that looks like fun!
TopGear sounds like the new f1 engines
TopGear sounds like the mazda mx5 is your choice may
TopGear Love the sound of that little blue car.
TopGear Seems like it should be fast in the dry. They should have sacrificed a little power Im favor of the muffler to make it sound like it looks. Its not a bloody rally car
TopGear So, what was the lap time? And how does it compare to the others on the board?
TopGear Haha, Id love to see someone go on Forza 5 and use the Ceterham on the Top Gear track and trie to beat his time!
TopGear Ive never been so disappointed in Top Gear. I want to see a dry lap and see where it ends up. How is 5 seconds slower than the R500 acceptable? The R500 got its YouTube fame partially because its so damn cheap. Give the underdog a fair fight!!
TopGear I wish this was how the new F1 cars would drive
TopGear I WANNA SEE JAMES MAY AND THE STIG BATTLE EACHOTHER IN A RACE!!
TopGear Uhhhhhh, THAT SOUND !Trumpets of Jericho, you jelly ?
TopGear I LOVE this type of videos! keep it up topgear!
TopGear I loved James film about the Caterhams.
TopGear I Love captain Slow but he is a bit too stiff about motoring!give him a straightaway and he will troll it, even with 900 horspower!
TopGear That little car sounds like baby lion or tiger ROARRRRRRAnd who is the stig!!!!!!!!!?
TopGear Love it, would trade my Audi A4 for a left hand drive Caterham 620r any day :)
TopGear Im sure hes smiling behind that visor  impossible not to be!
TopGear the stig is ether a woman or has a hefty set of tits 1.13
TopGear I would love to have one of those!
TopGear Still got this on video I will never sell it
TopGear Quite informative. Thanks for the share
TopGear They didnt put the S3 in S mode... Waiting for the new RS3 to be out!

TopGear Top Gear 19x03 ITA HD Seconda Parte
TopGear I have a feeling Gav and Dan were involved.
TopGear The most pointless thing ever since James Mays Ferrari.
TopGear Cars on fire  a typical night in Surrey?
TopGear They did this already with the Porsche from the show. TG content is so second rate.
TopGear Butbutbut ... what does it all MEAN?!? chuckle!
TopGear make the driver burns instead of the car.. id call that awesome
TopGear Weird, but I like it....I think.
TopGear maybe if we could have it at normal speed with the sound of the cars it wouldnt be yawn so boring.
TopGear if you dont want the subaru, then donate it to me, please dont burn it
TopGear this need music from deadmau5
TopGear This is what happens when robot Stig farts during a test drive.
TopGear I would gladly accept it if you guys donate the subaru, dont put them on fire.
TopGear Crazy stuff Top Gear!! I love it!! LOL
TopGear This TopGear Live looks awful.
TopGear Look at that Subaru acting like a GT3. (Hope this comment wont chatch fire)
TopGear Blue Man Group would be really cool to mix into this show, I believe they would fit right in there.
TopGear Am I the only one that thinks this is a waste of time?
TopGear This video helps in putting MCM in first place, dont know how some one can hate on MCM, they dont do pointles stupid things like this... and if they do they are funny as hell... this burning cars and art ish crap sucks balls
TopGear 50 Evo fans disliked the video.
TopGear Next time set the stig on fire too
TopGear Some say hes cold blooded, and that driving while on fire increases his fuel efficiency. But all we know for sure, is that hes the Stigs dragon cousin!
TopGear this is some abstract trippy stuff. whats Jeremy Clarkson on?
TopGear i love how they upload these videos when im high :
TopGear Nice slow mo fire but Subaru abuse is a crime against nature!
TopGear this is not crazy nor awesome. This is BORING
TopGear The subaru looks pretty good with those 80s style rear window louvers :)
TopGear I would like to see how the cars are made
TopGear Im confused as to why there is a Subaru doing donuts while on fire..
TopGear This is coming to barbados literally a week after I leave I wish I knew Im here now
TopGear CAN I PUT FLAMES ON MY CAR?!?!?!?
TopGear i think it looks pretty!
TopGear You guys seriously need to play the live sound... were into car sounds, lol not just slow mo
TopGear Perhaps he should tune his STI...I think its running a little rich at full throttle judging from the back seat fire.
TopGear It could explode at any moment
TopGear BEAUTIFUL..........nuff said!
TopGear Thats why you dont redline scoobies. They blow up.
TopGear What im wondering is, what colour is that subaruss front, i mean at start its blue and in the end its white
TopGear why does it have to be that suburu, why not the new ones.
TopGear theyre really on fire!
TopGear This needs to be on tv in the us
TopGear never had the chance to see rhis :
TopGear I would rather watch my own videos than pay to see this live.
TopGear that live show was in the netherlands. i was there
TopGear its all an act. rehearsed thousands of times and the jokes all memorised. the only time you get a little creativity is when something goes wrong and an idiot crashes doing 300mph and ends up in a coma
TopGear I so wanna go see them live!! I also want to go while they are doing a live taping at the top gear building  track! That would be amazing!
TopGear Top Gear live is worse than top gear us, because it directly removes the hosts from making top gear films :(
TopGear can we just have a making of special already...like a direct to DVD thing?
TopGear Is this the same guy who designed the Bond car in the first series? He sure has gone bald!
TopGear Garrys Mod in real life.
TopGear are you all ever going to come to the U.S. and do top gear live
TopGear topgear u spelled roland different in the video title and different in the video y?
TopGear Pls TopGear CZ (Czech Republick)
TopGear Dat gold nissan gtr at the end....
TopGear I went to Top Gear Live in Norway in 2011. Its the worst piece of scripted garbage ive ever seen. I love Top Gear, but this sucks..
TopGear If only they toured in the US. I need to see this
TopGear QWERTYUIOPASDFFGHJKLZXCVBNM
TopGear LIES! We all know the stig comes up with these crazy machines...Stop trying!
TopGear I think its kinda stupid to do such a show in front of bunch of people.. They are best at making Top Gear which is watched all over the world from millions of people. The best show in the world :)
TopGear Come to singapore and do top gear live! Id definitely go :)
TopGear I was there in Topgear live in the Netherlands. Amazing show!
TopGear Top gear always brings the original stuff
TopGear The engineering firms provide renderings made in the free version of Google Sketchup with stucktogether Warehouse assets and primitives? Hope they arent charging much, or if they are: can I get in on that?
TopGear I was there when that guy jumped over the jaguar in the vid
TopGear These guys are super antielectric.
TopGear You need to put top gear live on DVD or have it in a cinema in 3D.the fans would go and view this.IF YOU MAKE IT THEY WILL COME.
TopGear We got kids starving and these dudes makin cars out of washing machines amd blenders smh lmao
TopGear OMG!!! i wanna see once in my lifeeee!!!! :(pls come to italyyyyyy
TopGear Bring to USA please. South Florida to be precise. Thanks
TopGear Chuckle Brothers with carstricks? .. The live show is a little too circus based for me. I love a good circus, but not a circus that is genuinely trying to be serious, intelligent or classy.
TopGear Im actually looking for a washing machine at the moment..Which ones has the best power to weight ratio?
TopGear This guy is awesome but I hate how many episodes on TV we get each year. Seems like Top Gear live is taking away from the TV show
TopGear Top Gear Live needs to come to America.
TopGear the lambo jumper scene looks nice, but i guess he just jumps infront of the lambo and not above
TopGear Top Gear is turning into Monty Python. I dont see what all the fuss is about, or you have to be British to understand it?
TopGear Is it legal to conduct such test on open road?
TopGear it is wet but not wild
TopGear wet and wild.......sounds like a bad porno
TopGear Am I the only one who thinks Nick is hotter than James Blunt?.. :D
TopGear Serbians be mad? War is war people, what side you fought for has nothing to do with you as an individual. You can hate countries, people of a certain nationality in general, but you cant hate specific people over it.
TopGear i disliked it because blunt hates serbs
TopGear Wet and wild, just like female James Blunt fans at his concert.
TopGear Stig be like go home your drunk
TopGear almost every show seems to have wet conditions. Does it rain that much in the UK?!
TopGear I must say even though its irrelevant im surprised european cars work so good in the snow over here in canada my 97 audi a4 i bought as my first ever car and this was my first winter driving one of thee coldest ive ever experianced and most snow my car had less problems then my fathers jeep and my buddies truck im very satisfied with german engineering
TopGear Swimming pool at the end lol
TopGear Around 1:08 Stig brings up a very good point
TopGear 1:25 Looks like he is trying to record a fart :D
TopGear Those turns were executed wonderfully!
TopGear Whats the name of that vauxall?
TopGear Id never want a track day at the top gear test track because it always seems to be raining....
TopGear Richard hammond makes me feel wet and wild tbh
TopGear i know it was wet last time u came  hahahh is she serious with that question ?
TopGear Nick Dalton sounds a lot like Baron VonGrumble, although I know he isnt le baron :).
TopGear The Vauxhall Astra techline
TopGear That weather must get so depressing after a while...
TopGear Its raining Againsupertramp 3
TopGear Why did they bleed of the sky with red?
TopGear I am surprised to this day that no one has careened off the road and hit a cameraman.
TopGear I noticed there was a bit of water on the track surface BUT CLAMN!
TopGear Is the stig wearing an antifog shield in his helmet?
TopGear Thank god there havent been any Top Gear USA episodes....inbefore TG USA episodes...
TopGear Great to see the videos being up to date, great stuff! :D
TopGear Please upload last topgears news section. 3
TopGear 19 americans saw this !
TopGear 1:15  I know it was wet the last time you came,... thats what she said
TopGear i know it was wet last time you came xD
TopGear Caro blunt non sei capace canta solo
TopGear Awesome car control, stig is great!
TopGear terrible conditions for the tyres
TopGear As exciting as this lap was you Top Gear NEEDS to give it a fair dry lap. How can they accept that lap when its almost 5 seconds slower than the r500?! Not cool. I want to see if caterham can still shame the big dogs for a fraction of the price
TopGear I drove one close to 40 years ago when they were the Lotus Seven. Even the with the 1600 cc Ford engine you could do 45 degree power slides on dry pavement. That was long before drifting was even though of. The only problem was the windshield, it was like trying to push a barn door through the air, so your top speed was about 80 mph or 130 kph. But on a twisty road they are a huge amount of fun.
TopGear Thats in Dubai. Someone has a ram version of that, its a house
TopGear Seria 2 to nie tylko nowa nazwa maego coupe na bazie jedynki. To take nawizanie do sportowych skojarze marki i przywrcenie jej troch porzuconego wizerunku producenta samochodw dla kierowcy.
TopGear fajny materia, pozdrawiam:)
TopGear Mam pytanie czy dwik m235i pochodzi tylko z silnika i wydechu czy jest wspomagany sztucznie ? Bo musz przyzna ,e brzmi bardzo przyjemnie...
TopGear wietny materia. Czekamy na wicej :D
TopGear Super!! fajnie ze mamy polskiego Top Geara!
TopGear Why cant all these countries just let it be in english, in the Netherlands we pretty much always let the audio stay its original language.
TopGear 1:20 Literally got left in the dust...Wow.
TopGear thanks for broadcasting it in german  if you do it, when only with original (english) audio and german subtitles, not this gossiplevel wich they translate to...And lool at TG in Spain (brain overload coming :D )And btw: TG Australia has been RUINED with Season3, Season 2 was waaay better, season 1 was meh (mostly because of the primary host...)
TopGear I think Ill just watch it in English LOL!
TopGear TopGear has been dubbed in pretty much every language around the world.
TopGear Spanish sounds like Argentinian and Spaniard! LOL!
TopGear Italian 3english still the best
TopGear I shat myself laughing at Shanes face when Richard started talking Spanish!
TopGear Hammond in Spanish PRICELESS xD
TopGear I think German and the normal UK Voice are the best ones
TopGear american voice sucks ,  it s like to hear a duck speaking ... the english voice is more soft but not better than a latin voice really soft . i prefer to watch top gear in french than the american voice of top gear .  the english brit top gear voice is better but not so good than you say it .
TopGear The only thing that you can get a chance to win a free email service and the Price of the King of the Crown Estate is the most popular and the Price of the Crown Estate. The comments for your help. I have been a while to get your free time to time but I think the best way to get the best way to get the best way for the use of a new York City of London and the Price of course the UK and Ireland and Wales with company number of people who are looking for a couple of weeks ago by the way, and the Price of the Crown Estate
TopGear Im French,but i used to watch the French version,but not anymore,i simply cant get back to it,the English version is the best,end of story
TopGear Dubbing is the Work of Satan.
TopGear Greetings from Mxico. Spanish dubbing is rubbish.
TopGear I am German but I never watch this in my own language, I like the original English version.By the way, Hammond in Spanish is best.
TopGear Spanish is my favorite
TopGear hahahaha omg the spanish version
TopGear I usually dont like the dubbings here in Italy but when we talk about Top Gear...I LOVE IT. I cant decide if I love more the english (traditional) version or the italian one (specially when Jeremy talks!!)Love you guysCiao ciao :D
TopGear nothing better than english and omg spanish hahahhaa
TopGear I love the original, and prefer to watch it in the original version, but I have to say that the German voices actually fit pretty well.
TopGear I dont know what channel it must be on. But I would die to watch Top Gear UK here in the US
TopGear There are several translations into Castellano... two dubbers for each in Spain, as well as the Spanish American version...
TopGear You didnt hear Estonian.. because we like see and hear the real thing ! So no stupid voiceovers, only a simple subs on the bottom! xD so cheers English language! xD
TopGear spanish sounds like crazy frog
TopGear The german translation of Top Gear is crap and thats so I watch the original version
TopGear Spanish Hammond.Just... yes.
TopGear Great Britains version is the best! Every American knows that US version was a joke.
TopGear English top gear and english accent language beats all!
TopGear Im mexican, obviously my mother tongue is Spanish, however I cant stand anything the Spanish voice acting or abything else than the original. It simply is unnatural.
TopGear If you think that spanish is fast you should come visit where I live. Or just listen to spanish radio
TopGear Scandinavia, probably the only place where we do not dub shows or movies... in the woooorld.
TopGear Actually I thought a little bit more about it and I think Jeremy Clarkson should be dubbed over with car sounds, and James May should be dubbed over with farm animals.
TopGear I couldnt stand watching top gear in non english
TopGear Spanish (Spain) sucks!!!!! definitely prefer the original version
TopGear Only heard it once in Turkish and i can say it feels very strange to hear them in another voice. Original is the best.
TopGear Respect From PAKISTAN
TopGear Sound like Spain peoples no Mexicans
TopGear when you will come to saudi arabia
TopGear Turkish voice actors are terrible! In every movie they are always the same and they pronounce very strange.... German and original are the best! Spanish and more spanish sound very funny and I wonder why they need 1000 words to say somethink very eazy xD
TopGear The spanish of jammond is best xD
TopGear Voiceover is the indicator that a country is stupid and can not read subtitles!
TopGear i like the englich and the german languages
TopGear Thank God it is subtitled here in Greece, as are most foreign language shows.
TopGear pour other countries! its like yeah top gear is on, but why cant we hear their voices?oh yeah my country is too dumb to understand english. wedontdub
TopGear I am eternally thankful that they never tried to dub this in Hindi. shudder
TopGear Worlds most watched factual show... ahem... factual... Top Gear is my favourite TV show of all time and its definitely the most entertaining, but I wouldnt call it factual LMAO.
TopGear I loved the Ashes episode. One of the best they made.
TopGear Spanish from Spanien sucks and the other lenguages too. I prefer just in english with subtitles.
TopGear Common point: All translations are awful.
TopGear So far Ive watched it in french and watched Top Gear USA. Top Gear UK is still the Best.
TopGear Who needs dubbing when all you need is subtitles
TopGear And from here in south Kurdistan translate to kurdish
TopGear And you started with the Hungarian! Thats so cool :D
TopGear Subtitles are the best option. I get to hear what they really say and no translation can beat that... :D
TopGear Top Gear fans in Indonesia is very much, but why Top Gear dont have languange Indonesia?
TopGear Most Widely Watched Factual Television Programme in the World my gluteus maximus, does anyone remember their take on the Tesla roadster. Love the show but its only factual when it suits them.The High Court in London rejected Teslas libel claim, claiming the series is an entertainment programme and not an information programme.
TopGear I dont know, but the Hungarian version has a very similar voice for Jeremy. I havent seen this version.
TopGear Original voices are the best...in Mexico we love this show...jajajaja....no hard feelings
TopGear I meant Dubai is a city in UAE
TopGear German! But the BEST ones are the originals, the latest on the Top Gear Chanel on Streetfire!
TopGear What is everyone talking about. An American voice and an English voice ? Its the same language!
TopGear so glad that there isnt a dutch voiceover for it.
TopGear I think its important to underline factual :D im really glad german TV broadcaster stopped synchronise TG, and bringing the show with subtitles. Its actual much better in English.
TopGear AHAHAHA Hammond sounds so weird speaking in Spanish !
TopGear no thanks keep the real voice
TopGear happy to be norwegian... nothing is dubbed
TopGear hahahahaha Spanish was like real hamster :D
TopGear in the Netherlands they just use subtitles
TopGear hammond in spanish HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!
TopGear Its not dubbed in American? I feel a bit slighted. I know Jeremy disdains Americans but this is ridiculous.
TopGear I rather watch stuff in their original language and read the subs than dubbed. Dubbed ruins everything.
TopGear ive seen this car at nordschleife,
TopGear Jeremy has a certain way of describing things that is unlike any other host.
TopGear 5:00 The first time i drove a Mono it set fire to itself, the second time the engine went wrong and the third time it broke down before it even had left the factory. ...so its another typical British badly executed good idea...Its a bit like the Danish Zenvo.
TopGear it looks like it belongs in a mass effect game, its awesome
TopGear The song when Jeremy first drives the Mono is First Warning by The Prodigy.PROTIP Google search Top Gear songs and click on the link to the FinalGear forums, they have a complete listing of each episodes soundtrack.
TopGear is this car faster then the Atom 500?
TopGear That is the most beautiful car Ive ever seen. Coming in just above that Aston DBsomething that James May drove in the race to the Mexican border. Its like a robot and a foodmixer had a baby.
TopGear MonoMonkey in Spanish. Bac Monkey?
TopGear isnt BAC British Aircraft Corporation?
TopGear Imagine a stretch limousine version of this car.
TopGear Anyone know what Season and Series this is from?
TopGear music at 0:33 is from need for speed undercover :D
TopGear I believe the solution would be a helmet.
TopGear Just sayin Gforce has very little to do with whats happening to Jezzas face in this clip.
TopGear When can I try it in France?!!
TopGear Im watching this on an iPad
TopGear Oh look guys, its Albert Einstein :D
TopGear How is it Jeremys Face VS G Force? shouldnt it be moving air or wind instead of G Force?
TopGear they should have a racing series for these.
TopGear 6:12 well Im watching this on an iPad...
TopGear Top Gears production team reminds us why theyre the best. Great video. I wasnt expecting the car to be that expensive, though.
TopGear face like a ball bag!
TopGear Why dont the people who engineer these cars think Hey, why dont we put a cockpit type windshield on the car? Kind of like a fighter jet?Surely they can make one that doesnt weigh that much...
TopGear You dont need one. But you need one because it is such a lovely thing. Well told
TopGear Why wont you jus put on the kind of helmet that the stig has?
TopGear Pleas TopGear cz (Czech Republick )
TopGear Its called the BAC Monkey 3
TopGear 1:38 I laughed so hard !!
TopGear Id like to see him actually drive it on the public road XD
TopGear how about a drag race atom 500 vs bac mono
TopGear Come ride this in Mauritius 95 Sun all year long!
TopGear Driving without a helmet and then making an issue of his face going south. I suppose he has to cater for the wider audience. A well prepared professional wouldnt do it.
TopGear I will get the Atom first
TopGear Actually... Its the combination of Gforce and air causing it. You know G  mg  F  ma  G  ma. In this example Jeremy has a specific acceleration compared to airs mass. So in a way air has also acceleration compared to Jeremy. That plus the fact that air has its mass we can say that G  ma... Sry for not so clear explanation but just think about it...
TopGear Probably one of the best conclusion Ive ever seen.
TopGear Jeremy you old bastard you. Still kicking in the fast track as always haha. Well done.
TopGear Lol I love Jeremys face haha
TopGear Its an F1 car that have the wheel arches
TopGear The Brits have to learn how to punt their unions so they can make stuff that actually works.
TopGear Im french but I love it !!!
TopGear Check out this video on YouTube:
TopGear A drag race between the ariel and the mono would be nice to watch
TopGear All it needs is a fighter jet style cockpit and a bigger engine and it would be perfect
TopGear Jezza you can have your iPAD I would prefer the Mono any day over that iTOY
TopGear The background music is from Need for Speed Undercover on the DS Platform
TopGear I.want.one., its so.beautiful! And the gtr my dream car!
TopGear top gear in 4k anyone?
TopGear Absolutely beautiful!!
TopGear you didnt drive her during perfect road trip
TopGear the future of FORMULA 1
TopGear Hah Im watching on an iPad
TopGear 0:20The prodigy: First Warning.Yer welcome.
TopGear Thanks TG! You are my Chicken Soup, especially after a bad day at work, give me LOLs. Really was great when at home for 3 mos after roll over accident (not my fault!) Exciting motor info, laughs  real useful News. 8)
TopGear BAC Mono or Ariel Atom v8?
TopGear you forgot russian translation :(
TopGear My god... I found my dream track car! So beautiful.
TopGear Is this car comparable to the Ariel Atom?
TopGear My bladders gone! Its completely gone! Ive wet myself.
TopGear Question: for a fun racing car with a decent engine and open world experience, why should i pay 100k for the Mono when i can buy an Ariel for less than half?Im kinda missing the comparison between both here.
TopGear the ultimate track toy, but if you do the math, it has a power to weight ratio 2 times lower than the Agera one:1. i think that with the mono you get much more than what you pay, considering the price of the agera one:1 and considering that the mono is not much slower on a track
TopGear I dont want to go in to much detail, but let me put it this way: If I was a girl, I would like it very much. hahaha
TopGear With all that money, ud think he would have got his teeth fixed.
TopGear 1:47David Bowie  Hearts Filthy Lesson
TopGear This with an keoneggseg engine
TopGear this vs aerial atom ?!?
TopGear Start listening from 2:10 and onward. I loled so hard when he said If I was a girl... bit. XD
TopGear My goodness, Jeremy, please wash your teeth, theyre pretty much yellow!!!
TopGear How fast have all these tracked at
TopGear They should testdrive the new Radical RCX Turbo coming out soon :D That would be awesome :D
TopGear Why cant all these countries just let it be in english, in the Netherlands we pretty much always let the audio stay its original language.
TopGear 1:20 Literally got left in the dust...Wow.
TopGear thanks for broadcasting it in german  if you do it, when only with original (english) audio and german subtitles, not this gossiplevel wich they translate to...And lool at TG in Spain (brain overload coming :D )And btw: TG Australia has been RUINED with Season3, Season 2 was waaay better, season 1 was meh (mostly because of the primary host...)
TopGear i had a honda commercial before this video.
TopGear I think Ill just watch it in English LOL!

TopGear Scandinavia, probably the only place where we do not dub shows or movies... in the woooorld.
TopGear Actually I thought a little bit more about it and I think Jeremy Clarkson should be dubbed over with car sounds, and James May should be dubbed over with farm animals.
TopGear I couldnt stand watching top gear in non english
TopGear Spanish (Spain) sucks!!!!! definitely prefer the original version
TopGear Only heard it once in Turkish and i can say it feels very strange to hear them in another voice. Original is the best.
TopGear Respect From PAKISTAN
TopGear Sound like Spain peoples no Mexicans
TopGear when you will come to saudi arabia
TopGear Latvian !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear The spanish of jammond is best xD
TopGear Voiceover is the indicator that a country is stupid and can not read subtitles!
TopGear i like the englich and the german languages
TopGear Thank God it is subtitled here in Greece, as are most foreign language shows.
TopGear pour other countries! its like yeah top gear is on, but why cant we hear their voices?oh yeah my country is too dumb to understand english. wedontdub
TopGear I am eternally thankful that they never tried to dub this in Hindi. shudder
TopGear Worlds most watched factual show... ahem... factual... Top Gear is my favourite TV show of all time and its definitely the most entertaining, but I wouldnt call it factual LMAO.
TopGear I loved the Ashes episode. One of the best they made.
TopGear I actually prefer the original sound with sub!!
TopGear Common point: All translations are awful.
TopGear So far Ive watched it in french and watched Top Gear USA. Top Gear UK is still the Best.
TopGear Who needs dubbing when all you need is subtitles
TopGear And from here in south Kurdistan translate to kurdish
TopGear And you started with the Hungarian! Thats so cool :D
TopGear Subtitles are the best option. I get to hear what they really say and no translation can beat that... :D
TopGear Top Gear fans in Indonesia is very much, but why Top Gear dont have languange Indonesia?
TopGear Most Widely Watched Factual Television Programme in the World my gluteus maximus, does anyone remember their take on the Tesla roadster. Love the show but its only factual when it suits them.The High Court in London rejected Teslas libel claim, claiming the series is an entertainment programme and not an information programme.
TopGear Dubai isnt a country, its in the UAE well done for insulting them
TopGear Original voices are the best...in Mexico we love this show...jajajaja....no hard feelings
TopGear I meant Dubai is a city in UAE
TopGear German! But the BEST ones are the originals, the latest on the Top Gear Chanel on Streetfire!
TopGear What is everyone talking about. An American voice and an English voice ? Its the same language!
TopGear so glad that there isnt a dutch voiceover for it.
TopGear I think its important to underline factual :D im really glad german TV broadcaster stopped synchronise TG, and bringing the show with subtitles. Its actual much better in English.
TopGear AHAHAHA Hammond sounds so weird speaking in Spanish !
TopGear no thanks keep the real voice
TopGear Mexico!!!! In LOVE Top Gear
TopGear hahahahaha Spanish was like real hamster :D
TopGear in the Netherlands they just use subtitles
TopGear hammond in spanish HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!
TopGear Its not dubbed in American? I feel a bit slighted. I know Jeremy disdains Americans but this is ridiculous.
TopGear I rather watch stuff in their original language and read the subs than dubbed. Dubbed ruins everything.
TopGear ive seen this car at nordschleife,
TopGear Jeremy has a certain way of describing things that is unlike any other host.
TopGear 5:00 The first time i drove a Mono it set fire to itself, the second time the engine went wrong and the third time it broke down before it even had left the factory. ...so its another typical British badly executed good idea...Its a bit like the Danish Zenvo.
TopGear someone needs to brush his teeth lmao
TopGear The song when Jeremy first drives the Mono is First Warning by The Prodigy.PROTIP Google search Top Gear songs and click on the link to the FinalGear forums, they have a complete listing of each episodes soundtrack.
TopGear is this car faster then the Atom 500?
TopGear That is the most beautiful car Ive ever seen. Coming in just above that Aston DBsomething that James May drove in the race to the Mexican border. Its like a robot and a foodmixer had a baby.
TopGear MonoMonkey in Spanish. Bac Monkey?
TopGear isnt BAC British Aircraft Corporation?
TopGear Imagine a stretch limousine version of this car.
TopGear Anyone know what Season and Series this is from?
TopGear music at 0:33 is from need for speed undercover :D
TopGear This is why top gear is my favorite show ever awesome vid :)
TopGear Just sayin Gforce has very little to do with whats happening to Jezzas face in this clip.
TopGear When can I try it in France?!!
TopGear Im watching this on an iPad
TopGear Oh look guys, its Albert Einstein :D
TopGear How is it Jeremys Face VS G Force? shouldnt it be moving air or wind instead of G Force?
TopGear they should have a racing series for these.
TopGear 6:12 well Im watching this on an iPad...
TopGear Top Gears production team reminds us why theyre the best. Great video. I wasnt expecting the car to be that expensive, though.
TopGear Still my favorite go to the Atom
TopGear Why dont the people who engineer these cars think Hey, why dont we put a cockpit type windshield on the car? Kind of like a fighter jet?Surely they can make one that doesnt weigh that much...
TopGear You dont need one. But you need one because it is such a lovely thing. Well told
TopGear Why wont you jus put on the kind of helmet that the stig has?
TopGear Pleas TopGear cz (Czech Republick )
TopGear Its called the BAC Monkey 3
TopGear 1:38 I laughed so hard !!
TopGear Id like to see him actually drive it on the public road XD
TopGear how about a drag race atom 500 vs bac mono
TopGear Fendered at the front, Open Wheel at the back, strange.
TopGear Driving without a helmet and then making an issue of his face going south. I suppose he has to cater for the wider audience. A well prepared professional wouldnt do it.
TopGear I will get the Atom first
TopGear Actually... Its the combination of Gforce and air causing it. You know G  mg  F  ma  G  ma. In this example Jeremy has a specific acceleration compared to airs mass. So in a way air has also acceleration compared to Jeremy. That plus the fact that air has its mass we can say that G  ma... Sry for not so clear explanation but just think about it...
TopGear Probably one of the best conclusion Ive ever seen.
TopGear Jeremy you old bastard you. Still kicking in the fast track as always haha. Well done.
TopGear Lol I love Jeremys face haha
TopGear Its an F1 car that have the wheel arches
TopGear The Brits have to learn how to punt their unions so they can make stuff that actually works.
TopGear If I was a girl, Id like it very much
TopGear Check out this video on YouTube:
TopGear A drag race between the ariel and the mono would be nice to watch
TopGear All it needs is a fighter jet style cockpit and a bigger engine and it would be perfect
TopGear Jezza you can have your iPAD I would prefer the Mono any day over that iTOY
TopGear The background music is from Need for Speed Undercover on the DS Platform
TopGear I.want.one., its so.beautiful! And the gtr my dream car!
TopGear top gear in 4k anyone?
TopGear Absolutely beautiful!!
TopGear Some say that Stig is headless and Jemery wears his helmet.
TopGear the future of FORMULA 1
TopGear Hah Im watching on an iPad
TopGear 0:20The prodigy: First Warning.Yer welcome.
TopGear Thanks TG! You are my Chicken Soup, especially after a bad day at work, give me LOLs. Really was great when at home for 3 mos after roll over accident (not my fault!) Exciting motor info, laughs  real useful News. 8)
TopGear BAC Mono or Ariel Atom v8?
TopGear you forgot russian translation :(
TopGear My god... I found my dream track car! So beautiful.
TopGear Is this car comparable to the Ariel Atom?
TopGear No, i need an ipad, i couldnt watch this utrerly brilliant video without it!!
TopGear Question: for a fun racing car with a decent engine and open world experience, why should i pay 100k for the Mono when i can buy an Ariel for less than half?Im kinda missing the comparison between both here.
TopGear the ultimate track toy, but if you do the math, it has a power to weight ratio 2 times lower than the Agera one:1. i think that with the mono you get much more than what you pay, considering the price of the agera one:1 and considering that the mono is not much slower on a track
TopGear I dont want to go in to much detail, but let me put it this way: If I was a girl, I would like it very much. hahaha
TopGear With all that money, ud think he would have got his teeth fixed.
TopGear 1:47David Bowie  Hearts Filthy Lesson
TopGear This with an keoneggseg engine
TopGear this vs aerial atom ?!?
TopGear Start listening from 2:10 and onward. I loled so hard when he said If I was a girl... bit. XD
TopGear i want two...one in black on black matte
TopGear How fast have all these tracked at
TopGear They should testdrive the new Radical RCX Turbo coming out soon :D That would be awesome :D
TopGear Grazie amico per averlo caricato
TopGear Che bello! Grazie a te, riesco a vedere nuovi episodi e non gli stessi che ci rifilano in continuazione su D max. Ti voglio chiedere un cosa: esiste la seconda parte di questo episodio? Grazie ancora, ciaoooo.
TopGear Top Gear 19x03 ITA HD Prima Parte
TopGear Quando metti la seconda parte?
TopGear Christ a Brit will never pass up the opportunity to take a stab at the US just wedge an insult in there however they can..
TopGear A big thumbs up to the boys and girls who assemble the APC (behind the producer chap) at Ricardos, Shoreham Airport. My.home town
TopGear I counted 22 you knows, you know..?
TopGear Ummm, ya know, like. uhh, sort of, you know....YOU KNOW WHAT!? I DONT BLAME THEN GUY, SO PISS OFF ALL YOU YABOS
TopGear I would like to see a behind the scenes clip of what you guys did to the zenvo ?? But i guess that would make you guys look like morons...
TopGear 3:20 baha he liked it the way karl pilkington would
TopGear Reminds me of the US MRAP a little bit. This looks sleeker though and I doubt the MRAP goes 70
TopGear This video finally explains how the Ford Fiesta review was possible..........haha
TopGear You people..! You people have the best job!
TopGear well thes be on tv in aus ?
TopGear Why one You know isnt enought?
TopGear If id get a dollar for every single time he says you know, Id be millionaire.
TopGear Everyone Above and Below meloves topgear
TopGear disgusting war propaganda.
TopGear aah so this is the bloody producer P
TopGear Sounds like you put a lot of effort into something that could have been its own episode. Maybe consider releasing a top gear special with behind the scenes footage?
TopGear I wonder why everybody say Now i Know and No I dont know?
TopGear These are alright, nothing like whats in the American military, the most powerful military that has ever graced the universe.
TopGear His name is Oisin Tymon! How does the channel mess up its own producers name!
TopGear Spoiler: Its just 3 and a half minutes of this guy talking.
TopGear Cant get eyes off that P1 :)
TopGear I lost interest at about 1:30
TopGear and the guy below me is a total idiot
TopGear The real question is, do you know?
TopGear All I was looking at was that p1
TopGear I wish I had a pound for every time he said you know.
TopGear Awesome vid. Love the guy whos narrating
TopGear Jeez, he knows, you know
TopGear The show lost its flare. Probably thanks to this guy.
TopGear Only conversations. Just wanna know how the military ride made up
TopGear You know 23times in 3:30min You know!
TopGear With all the taxes taken to build all the equipment to go to war in other countries nothing should be left behind it should all come back to its country of orgin to be reused sold to collectors or scraped to build something else theres no sense in leaving it behind for the country we were at war with to profit off of it when the citizens that pay taxes payed for it to begin with
TopGear CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS
TopGear You know, I know , Everyone knows.
TopGear Looks like the Hunter from Arma 3
TopGear 301rst. I hope I play the game right.
TopGear Top Gear is UK Armys biggest recruitment ad.
TopGear even a behind the scene is better TopGear USA
TopGear more behind the scenes pls
TopGear So he is the producer.
TopGear For every: you know drink a shot :D
TopGear obama has destroyed our military,you can go to war for obama and die at eighteen or twentys,and then he will praise and fund the same people who killed you,or pull out after thousands have died and let them take back over,so your life is over for what,you are all pawns in his chess game,
TopGear Afghanistan is where the UK and United States protect our precious oil reserves and say its a matter of stopping the spread of terrorism. Also great vid, but motor trend splattered a Prius with a m1 Abrams and I thought that was  more pleasing to watch.
TopGear Im not into men but he looks quite handsome
TopGear For the love of god I dont know!
TopGear primarily I thinkthe moment I hear I think you just KNOW this guy does not know what hes talking about half the time and is just guessing
TopGear reminds call of duty ghosts
TopGear A lovely bit of kit? Really? I am of British decent I am first generation Canadian. I am so glad I dont talk like that. By the way its not a torch its a flash light!!! I am not your mate!! I am your friend. And I dont smoke fags!! I smoke cigarettes! Thats all done bitching eh!! Lol
TopGear Blimey young bloke,,you know..playin,had to do it YOU KNOW!
TopGear Top Gear should do a road trip where the presenter each pick a military Armorued fighting vehicle and they have to go from point A to point B.Dont tell me this cant be done in say Russia !
TopGear Im now convinced you know is the American equipment for like
TopGear I like this guy... Give him Andy Wilmans job.
TopGear So this is how Megaforce got started! I mean the one with Barry Bostwick, not the Power Rangers.

TopGear And dont you just wish you could drive a tenth as well as those people can! I DO!!!
TopGear I remember Top Gear Live 2009 in Hong Kong. I had no idea it was taking place there but I happened to be on holiday in Hong Kong at the time (in February), and was in the shopping centre whose upstairs floor had been booked out for the show. At a later or earlier point (I cant remember), I saw Clarkson and his (now ex) wife queuing for a traincarriage ride back down a hill of some sort. No idea why Im telling you this.
TopGear seriously why is there a top gear live
TopGear Celica chromed in gold... Not a fan of that
TopGear I have RS, ...is simpy: IS FORD!!!!!...
TopGear Paul Swift  Drives cars.
TopGear can anybody subscribe me please i have one video called kids news 1 that was a kid made it.
TopGear i cant make it to top gear live anymore because they moved it from earls court to somewhere else, now if i want to see it i might as well rent a hotel room so i can arrive a day early rather than late.
TopGear omg i cant wait till topgear comes barbados :D im here waiting !
TopGear how comes european fords are better than american fords....that shouldnt be right should it?
TopGear Post the top gear live video!
TopGear The Ford Focus badly needs a redesign. Ugly.
TopGear Drag racing implys something else, would this then be called cartography or synchroneous driving?

TopGear Top Gear 19 Stagione Episodio 2  Parte 22
TopGear Am I the only one who is getting tired of all the Loki questions? I get it  hes really good in that role and it is what made him famous, but the guy is a great actor who has done a lot more serious roles and, quite frankly, is just WAY too talented to be only known for as Loki.
TopGear He was burdened with glorious purpose
TopGear Thor VS Loki please!!
TopGear He is sooo sneakyyyy :))
TopGear Oh look a god driving.... Loki take the wheel!
TopGear He seems like a chill dude.
TopGear Vishwa narasimman The only two countries I know that goes rightsided is Japan and Great Britain
TopGear Thor is causing the rain...just some.of u would be wondering
TopGear Shame they didnt get Chris Hemsworth on as well  we couldve had Thor vs Loki.
TopGear Just imagine Loki in a traffic jam.
TopGear Does Loki drive? Its like asking does Simon Cowell drive. Villains dont drive, they have personal driver, limos, battlecruisers....etc
TopGear search for Tom Hiddleston as Thor casting video
TopGear I want to see Thor drive!!!
TopGear I dont have a smartass comment for this one....thats rather unusual.
TopGear its rainy but our spirits are not dampened hah
TopGear May as well bring in all the Avengers for a Reasonably Priced CarOff.
TopGear Its England, when isnt it wet?? S
TopGear He likes wind, but he hates thunders.
TopGear Hell...just get in me IN THE CAR. I dont even like driving in fast cars......
TopGear I like Tom in glasses
TopGear When I have to go to the UK, it takes me a week to get used to driving on the right side. And I seems to piss off everyone when I have to use any roundabouts.
TopGear I just love Tom  the umbrella. : ) I have never seen an umbrella do that in my life. I dont know how many times I have watched that part  always laugh. : )
TopGear Tom has given me a new look on life, I would really love to met him.
TopGear there should have been some thunder and lightning in this scene
TopGear He would not be a very good driver. I got to admit, I probably would do the same things he was doing if I was driving hard.
TopGear Looks like thor has strucken him down with his......rain or summet like that.
TopGear Hes so adorable with glasses on :3
TopGear Most adorable human being on the planet! I just love this! :D
TopGear 1:03 lol the umbrella! EPIC FAIL
TopGear In the description, they spelt his name Ton HiddlestonE. With an E. Theres no E
TopGear If Loki was driving hed probably hit everyone that got in his way and didnt move
TopGear he is so gorgeous. crying
TopGear right sided driving ?!!!!
TopGear Tommy... I love you, but please! I love sleeping too! Its 2:35! Lemme sleep!
TopGear I dont know much about cars and I certainly couldnt drive stick, but Tom? Well, he IS driving ME ... crazier.
TopGear The way he describes Loki as a driver is a perfect description of Jeremy Clarkson...
TopGear Yah but he still stalled on one of his starting runs, lol...
TopGear A jag driver, thats the kind of driver he would be
TopGear HAHAHAHA The Umbrella. Thats the summary of my humor. xD
TopGear A bloody reckless one, muttering and shouting through gnashed teeth and plowing through shopping centers, his only source of joy being the claret spattered on his windscreen. A reluctant grin would crawl into the corners of his face as he counted each successive pedestrian passing from sight below his front bumper.
TopGear i reckon loki would have road rage. god forbid anyone gets in his way on the road.
TopGear fake Loki drives a jaguar duhh
TopGear When is the next season of USA top gear coming !
TopGear Cowell nearly always drives himself, hes a big driving enthusiast and drives a Morgan Aero Coupe most of the time in the States.
TopGear Wait!! Loki never would drive a car.
TopGear Top Gear is a fun and informative television show to watch. I enjoy the talents of the special guests.
TopGear Morgen Freeman should be the next celebrity in a reasonably priced car
TopGear what car is he driving?
TopGear omg hes just like me!!! i also wears specs for driving on rainy days!!! we are soooo meant to be..xD
TopGear Is it weird that I keep seeing huddlestone?
TopGear Loki is cool. He just is.
TopGear I thought hed be driving a Jaguar
TopGear Thor deliberately send rain to sabotage Lokis time lap
TopGear He would have a tank anxld beibg mad with the tank.
TopGear The original driving god: Richard Hammond  I am a Driving God
TopGear there aint no E on the end of his last name. its just Hiddleston..
TopGear He has such nice teeth.....  sigh
TopGear why didnt he fly trough the track.
TopGear he sounds like hes a dj on the radio
TopGear Why isnt the assistant producer a presenter? Hes better than the current ones...
TopGear The cutie who did the introduction though.... !
TopGear Blame Thor for the rain :P
TopGear Gosh shes adorable!!!
TopGear You need to get Gary Oldman behind the wheel sometime...
TopGear They didnt even show his time... was he really that bad?
TopGear Yall should allow Top Gear world wide not only on stupid BBC which is watchable in the UK.
TopGear Loki goes need for speed?
TopGear This was one of the best top gear episode in my opinion
TopGear they NEED chris hemsworth!
TopGear lol, do Thor vs Loki to race each other :Di hope Loki wins :P
TopGear never heard of tom hiddlestone
TopGear He could just use illusion to get the best time.
TopGear Thor tried to stuff him up with all this weather
TopGear Tom Hiddleston and Top Gear together? Epicness overload!!!
TopGear He didnt really fly around that track as well as he said he did. Its Loki... come on! He tricked us yet again.
TopGear Englands great if youre a duck.Its either raining, just finished raining or just about to start raining.
TopGear Why do I not hear Americans on the Oracle team USA boat? They sound rather AustralianNew Zealandish? (Forgive me for not being able to tell the difference in accents between those 2 countries.)
TopGear One of my favourite TopGear races. With the Ford Shelby GT500 vs The EurostarTGV in first obviously
TopGear This is called 90 mile beach, because it is exactly 55 miles long. Made my day! :D
TopGear This was really fun to watch, but it still makes me a bit confused. So Top Gear go to New Zealand to race a Toyota Corolla against a yacht, but they still havent been to Australia to cover the Falcon? I hope they are planning to do a massive Australia episode because its about time they do.
TopGear Wow, Mr. May truly took a batter...tips hat
TopGear The car is blue again 5:31 what ???
TopGear love the 55 miles long 90mile beach
TopGear I could have sworn It was blue 5:31.
TopGear James, It was blue when you set off wasnt it? I could have sworn it was blue. Jeremy, No no it was red. hahaha very funny stuff!
TopGear Can any body tell me what is the name of the toyota plz
TopGear i wish someday toyota will make a super car. like the nissan GTR. just something equivalent to it. toyota is slowly getting out of the market race to me. the 2014 models are just shit!!
TopGear 90 mile beach, because its 55 miles long. LOL
TopGear this was one of the worst top gear episodes
TopGear Shame the BBC edited the guts out of this. Not really worth watching.
TopGear Could have swore it was blue wasnt it
TopGear he didnt even lift up the hood to see what was wrong.....
TopGear To much BS in this one.
TopGear I have replied to way too many comments on this post, ah well, some of you need to correctedinformed on some things
TopGear 7:51 HAHAHA the look of do my eyes deceive me
TopGear Take a look at this video on YouTube:
TopGear It was blue JamesA trater hit it
TopGear The noise Jeremy makes at 0:29 is hilarious
TopGear Im kinda surprised the Oracle team is in NZ. Do they normally train here?
TopGear Laugh out loud got caught
TopGear I was so excited when I heard they filmed an episode here in New Zealand then I watched it and was let down. We have so many amazing roads to drive and this it what they did ......a corolla... lame...
TopGear 90 mile beach is called 90 mile beach because its exactly 55 miles Im from New Zealand and I dont even know why its called 90 mile beach when its not even 90 miles long! xD
TopGear Yacht, is a type of boat, with a sail... Duh
TopGear Thumbs up for May beating up Clarkson! Not for the wind power vs gas thing. It is just that everytime Clarkson looses, I get to smile...
TopGear They call it 90 mile beach because its exactly 55 miles long.
TopGear For a car program, it kinda weird that cars hardly win these races!
TopGear James Mays reaction at the end is truly priceless. Hahaha!
TopGear 90 mile beach that is exactly 55 miles LOL
TopGear Still... Could be Worst... xD
TopGear Top Gear needs to review more rental cars, this is probably the best car vs something else race theyve ever had.
TopGear culdnt stop laughing when i saw james,s face when he saw the red car instead of blue one
TopGear Yes, because the fastest car in the world just happens to be a Corolla!
TopGear 2.47 min do u see the flying fishs ??
TopGear James May is working! xD
TopGear 5:29 the door is blue again O.o 5:39 red hahahaha
TopGear So why was it called the Fastest Car again..? Ahehehe... Call me captain obvious but, I just have to make sure hehehe...
TopGear 5:06 door frame is a red5:31 door frame is a blue.
TopGear Safety management organizations in every country should think about how to control these risks, like various traffic regulations on highway and city roads.
TopGear 7:07 microphone in top left corner of the screen. Lol and did yall notice at when he got back from the beach to gravel he said Back to gravel again was not expecting that the car was supposed to be red, was blue!? Look at the frame.... :D
TopGear where has that Serbian guy gone that called NZ boringI want to have more fun with Him
TopGear I love top gear!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear Mr Clarkson, how do you explain your door frame is BLUE at 5:31 while its back to RED at 5:40? I thought the original blue car was down at that point... Another fun but madeup episode, Im afraid.
TopGear Look at the sand around the flag 7:08 vs 7:37
TopGear the reason you dont like sailing is because you wernt getting stuck in.
TopGear Thats still my favorite hehe:Koenigsegg One:1 2014 Geneva Motor Show HD
TopGear does Jeremy have IWC Top Gun? :O
TopGear at 5:07, Jeremy flicked the wrong switch
TopGear Kkzsl.z..zllalllalllhbvbf:)v xcdfvbvcfbb,mmbccbnmmN
TopGear what the episode is this?
TopGear That is not the fastest car in the world
TopGear 5:31 the door sill is blue. Then hes back in the red car. Are the editing skills starting to get weak?
TopGear What do you mean fastest car in the world?
TopGear I thought James liked sailing? Hahahaha.
TopGear damned ! this is a super boat !
TopGear What then fast car is buggrte. Or towyoter
TopGear Classic T G they dont make them like that anymore :(
TopGear I loved this episode!!!!.......It was blue when you set off.HAHAHA
TopGear do you see the expression on james face when he sets eyes on the the car at first? priceless
TopGear OMG tractor... BAM hit the wall:D
TopGear Jeremy  o sarcasmo puro!
TopGear This is called 90 mile beach because it is exactly 55 miles long Oh Jeremy, y u so funny
TopGear If The stig is norwegian Im gonna guess its Tommy Rustad. He was the driver on the norwegian version of fifth gear a few years back and hes pretty damn good.
TopGear Stig with the umbrella.. Looks so dainty. LoL!
TopGear So this stig is possibly Norwegian...now to narrow down the possibilities. Maybe he was joking, who knows.
TopGear Boooooorrriiiinnnnnnnnngggggg!!!!!!!
TopGear Cold rain weather?This is perfect weather for a British show
TopGear BBC what the hell have you done to The Stig?!?! he is using an umbrella! its impossibile! he is The Stig he only know how to use a car!
TopGear They would NOT have aired that Stig had a Norwegian accent.....
TopGear Season 21 spoiled 2 secrets of the Stig in 1 episode:He has a Norwegian accent, and he hates the rain
TopGear SO the Stig do talk... with Norwegian accent... hmmmm
TopGear BOOORRRRRIIIINNNNNNNGGGGGG
TopGear Hmm... So my best guess then is that the Stig is a Norwegian F1 Driver.
TopGear i bet the new Stig is Mikka Hkinnen
TopGear the stig is one of the daft punk  but it s a secret
TopGear Some say the stig has a Norwegian accent, others say Norwegians has the stigs accent!!!
TopGear 00:03 the stick is a woman.
TopGear its wet, its cold....its Britain!
TopGear I love the Kia Ceed. We cant get it here in the US any more. So, alas, I drive a Hyundai. Not bad, but not as cool as a Ceed.
TopGear Surely the Norwegian accent bit was a red herring, just like all of the Some Say intros.
TopGear Review the mercedes a45
TopGear So.... Where is Stigs umbrella at the start?
TopGear Looks like the Stig hase some small Boobies..so it could be Sabine Schmitz aswell...:)
TopGear Mr Enormous Stiffytown is trying to mislead us about the sticks origins, like the mighty bondvillian that he is..
TopGear Maybe it wasnt actually Norwegian and the stig is actually Hekki Kovalainen
TopGear Love a man in lippy haha
TopGear So... Stig is Pal Virik Nilsen.
TopGear Guys...the Norwegian accent is misleading. If it were true, they would have edited it out..
TopGear Hugh is like an older version of Dan Hardcastle
TopGear Youre all idiots, the stig is Chuck Norris
TopGear You lost me at top gear people
TopGear THE STIG IS MIKKA HKINNEN OMG
TopGear It would be cool if the Stig is Jay Kay, but i think he isnt.
TopGear You, guys, do realize that hes an ACTOR and he could have said the Stig has an Indian or Chinese accent with the same straight face (and then act like he wasnt supposed to say it).
TopGear The Stig has a Norwegian accent?!?!
TopGear I like how the Stig had an umbrella when he wears an helmet.
TopGear Stig is former formula 3 driver. Thats all I know
TopGear Super Light Cars and Ryan Ellis on Gearzput the Stig in this.
TopGear wtf is this? howbout you show some episodes... dont get them here in germany
TopGear so the stig is from norway?
TopGear Norwegian accentdisinformation,misleading statement...The Stig has lost his neck,now appears to be shorter than he has been in the past...
TopGear 3:41 a wee bit of agricultural racing.
TopGear soo..Petter Solberg? that would be great!
TopGear Wheres the road? Oh that will do. I was rolling when he said that.
TopGear I love how in the second interview bit, Stig had gotten out of the car like: Norwegian accent? Screw you, im gonna stand outside and someones gonna put an umbrella in my right hand so i dont melt.Since we all know liquid metal Terminators tend to melt.Or is it a Terminatrix? All we know is, hes called the Stig.
TopGear Some say Stig is Mika Hakkinen
TopGear He was joking about the accent, otherwise they wouldnt have let it in.
TopGear Hugh Bonneville Behind the Scenes  Top Gear  Series 21 http:ow.ly2DTQlFtopgear
TopGear Why doesnt the Stig have a white umbrella? And I thought Stig was waterproof...
TopGear meanwhile in top gear usa, the wind blows xD
TopGear why do so many people believe that what this man says about stigs accent. are you so daft? Obviously they wouldve editted out that part if it were a truth. They just told him to say that for entertainment.
TopGear GGGGGRRRRRAAAAAZZZZZIIIIIIEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!
TopGear Ma su discovery channel c la serie 20??
TopGear ciao, come fai a caricarli senza farti rompere x il copyright? a me lo hanno fatto
TopGear grande, continua a caricare le nuovi stagioni ti prego
TopGear Da dove le prendi le puntate?? :D
TopGear Ma la seconda parte ?
TopGear Da dove le prendi le puntate?? :D
TopGear Watch a behind the scenes video of this stunt here: INFERNO  Porsche 911 vs Flame Thowers  Top Gear Live
TopGear I totally believe in setting fire to our lives, 911s included!Good day, mate!
TopGear Why are they using bad replicas?
TopGear Is the Stig in there? Wouldnt be surprised, THE STIG IS IMMORTAL.
TopGear ugh... the slow motion ruins everything about this illusion.
TopGear I clicked the Dislike button simply because, as an exPorsche owner, I couldnt bear to watch a supercar being torched.
TopGear i would love to believe a certain brit filmed this, a certain superhero, Vav, i hope you filmed this
TopGear Well heck Top Gear, if youve got spare Porsche 911s to set fire to, you could alternatively give them to me?
TopGear Kind of ironic how the GT3 has been delayed because it keeps bursting into flames
TopGear a burning porche ..... reminds me of paul walker .hope he enjoys his new life in heaven .
TopGear its very entertaining to watch compared to the dry auto shows that we get in usa and Canada, but the reviews are not correct, still funny to watch though.
TopGear This is pretty cool...all the mods that would have to be necessary to make this possible must be incredible.
TopGear Epic. Insanely epic. Slightly useless, but still epic.
TopGear I think people need to get over their feelings over inanimate objects. : Dont get me wrong I love cars too, but I wouldnt get too caught up in emotions over a flaming car.
TopGear That was beautiful....
TopGear Who is the chick!!! She can light me up any day!!!
TopGear Why use a 911 when you can use a nonmodified Gallardo? HAHA WINKWINKNUDGENUDGESMILE
TopGear this is more slowed down than I expected. Look at the monitor in the background  you can see the individual frames, running 2hz. Assuming that theyre standard 60hz monitors, that means that in real time, these cars would appear to be going about 30x faster. Even if theyre 30hz thats pretty damn impressive.
TopGear Need the Nickelback song here (Burn it to the ground).
TopGear Dear top gear cameraman,stop using slow motion in coming top gear episode.
TopGear Richard must have been crying.... And i bet this was Jeremys idea
TopGear The best kind of 911, one on fire :)
TopGear do the lights flash at that speed in slow motion?
TopGear I feel as though Jeremy had something to do with this...
TopGear REST IN PEACE PAUL WALKER 3
TopGear I brought some brats!
TopGear i could watch this for hours ... all the small things look so amazing ... the slowly updating screen, the stage lights, the tyres spinning, the way the engine sucked in the flames in the end ... amazing. oh and the music is perfect for it too  btw anyone knows what it was?
TopGear This video is pretty hot
TopGear This reminds Paul Walker Death.They shouldnt made this video.
TopGear My eyes are burning, I wish I could just save the rims.
TopGear I was at Top Gear Live in Amsterdam, but those Porsches werent really on fire. You could see some special parts placed on the roof and front, which caught fire, but didnt let them burn down so calm down Porsche fans...
TopGear let me guest, jeremys idea, i bet he some where in the back rubbing his hands and an evil laugh, burn porsche burn..................
TopGear That girl is so hot...because of fire I mean.
TopGear Porsches in flames? Too soon junior!
TopGear pointless waste,i used to like top gear,now all i see is ego fueled presenters who get paid for thrashing,destroying cars people in the REAL world could only dream of owning,its gone from being a fantastic show which was informative to this show of meaningless excuse of entertainment

TopGear neat watching the big TVs in the BG and noticing that they are stuttering from the lower frame rates compared to the slow mo camera!
TopGear That girl is so hot...because of fire I mean.
TopGear Look like another ghosh riders car
TopGear pointless waste,i used to like top gear,now all i see is ego fueled presenters who get paid for thrashing,destroying cars people in the REAL world could only dream of owning,its gone from being a fantastic show which was informative to this show of meaningless excuse of entertainment
TopGear hope you bring it Out the south Africa this year
TopGear Does Hammond know youre doing this???
TopGear did the car burn to the ground ?
TopGear Obviously Jeremeys idea...
TopGear Inspired by the dreams of Jeremy Clarkson.
TopGear And they are still exploding
TopGear You can tell when the rating start to slip. Its when they waist money destroying beautiful thing in the name of entertainment.
TopGear Can I have that 911 now ?!!!!
TopGear I imagine the thought process behind this went something like, Cars and women are too mainstream. Lets do cars, women and FIRE! Thatll knock em dead!
TopGear CoolBeautiful.Nice Art.Thanks.
TopGear your video is so cool
TopGear TheoreticallyHamond drives and Clarkson is the pyro.
TopGear They shouldve used a red Carrera GT.
TopGear Commercial for Porche! Their sales fell due to Paul Walker accident
TopGear Its like being into one of Jeremy clarksons dreams :p
TopGear 291 people are Americans who, for some odd reason, have a problem with associating flames and 911...
TopGear CALL 911!! THERES A FIRE
TopGear ghost riders, porsche
TopGear Here is a idea. Put a shoot out of home built super cars to the test!!! then put them up against the big boys of the industry. I know that at least 2 kit cars that can do this. the RCR superlite and the Ultima GTR. I think the Factory 5 company could do it as well.
TopGear Damn cool stunt! But how do you keep the audience from suffocating?
TopGear Looks brilliant is slow motion.
TopGear Only flamers drive Porsches
TopGear It looks very pretty in slow motion.However, you can also see very clearly how the car has been setup with jets near the rear exhaust pipes spraying burning material onto the floor. You can also see that ALL the fire on the car is generated by gas jets setup inside various openings in the car.Sure its done as a pretty stunt, but whats the point?
TopGear Is this what heaven looks like?
TopGear I would have liked it better if there was an extreme close up.
TopGear Im a fan of this show and I think this is pointless
TopGear So if your car is all of a suddenly ambushed by a flame throwing lady while your driving on your Porsche 911 you just start doing donuts.what happened to stop drop and roll
TopGear Paul Walker or too soon?
TopGear thats getting a bit desperate TG. next they will have cheese parties and giant tins of soup and shit.... i mean come on, its pretty... just not what i need as a viewer, from TG, to be entertained
TopGear Wait Whaa did he just do!
TopGear HEY IM A MILLIONAIRE AND IM BORED LETS GO SET MY LAMBO ON FIRE!
TopGear Truly.. AMAZING..  fine a piece of CRAP !! ..Looks SObad ..I AM Gonna vomit FOR your honour.  SALUTE, britIDIOTS.
TopGear Coming down the the first corner ..... BIG CAR SMASHES ....
TopGear you called david tennant gay!!!!! i fucking hate you!!!!!!
TopGear The funniest 20 seconds of Top Gear ever!!!
TopGear I used to bike a lot before my bad feet, but some of the people I see out there nowadays makes me want to atomic wedgie their stupid lycra pants.
TopGear Im sorry, cyclists of London, but Top Gear really did get this spot on.
TopGear This is a bloody good one from TopGear BICYCLING magazine topgear
TopGear Top Gear  Finally saying it like it is
TopGear I do come to a stop, or a very slow crawl at reds even when theres no traffic to be seen.
TopGear Dear cyclists of Toronto: PLEASE WATCH THIS.
TopGear To all the Dutch people that are going crazy about this: I like you Dutch guys but chill out about the cycling.
TopGear Car drivers. 30 and 40. Learn the bloody difference. ha ha ha
TopGear Jesus christ, more people who have no idea how he law works. If it does not have a motor it does not need to about traffic laws. You wouldnt stop a bike for speeding. Stupid misguided crap.
TopGear MOTORISTS. RED AND GREEN.LEARN THE BLOODY DIFFERENCE.
TopGear I think this is the funniest thing Ive ever seen.
TopGear Le Reddit Army is here!
TopGear The word red was written in orange.
TopGear im a cyclist and this is true hahaha
TopGear cyclist learn the bloody difference!
TopGear So it seems theyre the same all over the world.
TopGear Awesome! Very suggestive :)
TopGear I did only cycle when i had no car (last time was when i was 18)
TopGear Stupid idiot English cavemen. Bikes and cars are not the same. Build bike paths. Learn the bloody difference!It doesnt matter if you go through red or green. You will be killed anyhow no matter how fucking green the light is.
TopGear Cars drivers, this: (    ) is not 1,5m
TopGear Stupid joke. Cycling rules!
TopGear Its funny because it is true.
TopGear First the awesome run out of alabama episode and now this. If I was suppose to start watching top gear without really being into cars would I enjoy it? And if so which season should I start on?
TopGear CYCLISTS. RED AND GREEN. LEARN THE BLOODY DIFFERENCE.
TopGear More bad drivers than bad cyclists.
TopGear You guys, its urgent that you accept salvation from hell fire!All humans have sinned, and all our sins added together equal eternity in hell, on the other hand you can believe in Jesus Christ alone and he will save you.Jesus is the son of God Totally God and totally Man) who never ever sinned, was brutally killed on the cross for our sins, (each bad thing we do was left in a tomb, and recovered from death back to life.At the exact moment you believe in him alone, Jesus will add eternal life and forgiveness of sins to your life.
TopGear They should also do a PSA on FLs law needing at least 3 feet to pass a cyclist. Considering Ive been sideswiped twice since January Though, I cant complain. I have an open lawsuit with the city bus, so Ill make a decent settlement of that for not being able to lift weights for 2 weeks
TopGear Funny cause its true.
TopGear I dont get it. Were not bomb experts.
TopGear As a cyclist, I find this hilarious. It could be that I follow road laws, but either way its funny.
TopGear This is wonderful! hahahah
TopGear One of the best safety ads ever, as for the Westminster councillors they should be sacked for not taking heed.This ad gets the point across, until there is legislation and compulsory registration with a number plate certain cyclists will carry on being reckless as they cannot be caught.
TopGear Im a cyclist, and I absolutely love this video.I got one better:  Police, nab the bloody cyclists who violate. We are not pedestrians.
TopGear Any auto advert about the difference between 50cm and 1,5m?...
TopGear Its not nice to make fun of colorblind people.
TopGear Fuck anyone that rides a bike on the roads. Get the fuck out of the way you cunts. I always run them off the roads when I see them
TopGear Yeah, learn it lycrawearinghippies
TopGear As a cyclist, spot on. Too many people run red lights. Numpties.
TopGear As a cyclist, spot on. Too many people run red lights. Numpties.
TopGear XD ahahaha! beautiful!
TopGear highway code specifically stated that cyclists MUST STOP at red lights. Cyclists are breaking the law and getting away from it. I laughed at this commercial because cyclists are dumb and are dangerous.
TopGear I totally agree :)Fellow Trontonian :)
TopGear Had that happen to me yesterday, a cyclist who just drove out into the road, I had to slam on the breaks, and she had the nerve to say watch out, guess what... she had a red light.
TopGear The funniest thing I have seen in years!! I do wish this clip included a bit of the panels reaction to this in order to put in context.
TopGear Im offensive and I find this visually impaired!
TopGear Being both a cyclist and a car driver, I cannot agree more with this public safety announcement by Top Gear (copyright BBC).Top Gear Bicycle Advert
TopGear haha this should be run as a safety ad in Vancouver
TopGear but not pedestrians? Thats not really fair. I think its OK for a cyclist to go thru a red if there is no one coming. Anyone who is getting to where they are going using their own energy and not being lazy in a car should be allowed to get there as fast as they can, safely of course. Hell a lot more drivers go thru yellows and reds than cyclists.
TopGear Some traffic lights dont work if you are on a bike. They detect the cars with the sensor, but they dont detect you on a bike, and dont change from red to green.
TopGear Good one. But I still think it totally misses the point. As a cyclist I am really aware that in case of crash its me whos getting the worse part, and believe me, I dont want to get run over by two tons of steel and plastic. All of the cyclists I see running red ligths are at intersections where it is totally safe to do so (you could even just get off your bike, cross the street like a pedestrian and get on your bike again). In many countries bikes are only obliged to yied on red lights, not stop and in many others bikes can go against the sense of circulation, may sound ludicrous for drivers, but if you are a cyclist it totally makes sense.
TopGear Everyone We all need to check top gear! Top Gear: Series 21: Episode 5
TopGear Be safe. Take risks. In that order.
TopGear The best part about cycling is no traffic laws.
TopGear Okay, as long as Car drivers observe the minimum safe passing distance. (I dont run reds BTW)
TopGear Funny... Every time I hear about a bicyclist being injured at a controlled intersection, its because a CAR ran the red light. Every damn time.
TopGear Hey Zog, we continue to watch your progress in the media with fond memories of the little guy you were when we first met. Your Dad would have been so proud!
TopGear Im a cyclist I wholeheartedly agree.
TopGear This from two guys who treat roads as if they were a playground. Roads are for getting places, tracks are for racing. Topgear...learn the difference.
TopGear Lmao ive had some issues with cyclists both as a pedestrian and driver. Green and Red is definitely a big problem. Also illegal attempts to overtake :D
TopGear Could someone post please full clips of whole cyclist bit including the screaming men set on fire? ta blesses Arek
TopGear hahahaha nice one i stop when its red .. but not when the road is clear
TopGear Shit was that Frank Underwood with the double knuckle tap at the end?
TopGear Absolutely nailed it. Cyclists are a menace. www.SpareTheRoad.com
TopGear Soooo which wire was it again?
TopGear I am a van driver, a car driver and a cyclist and would love to see Clarkson, May and most smug drivers, attempt to cycle though the London traffic.Like most people who bully others, they belittle cyclist because they are too frighted of doing it themselves. They moan about the very problem lazy buggers like them create. If you dont like traffic get up 10 minutes earlier walk, cycle or take the bus or train and leave the cars for those who really need to get around in one. I use other forms of transport and only drive when it is absolutely necessary, so I can appreciate what a luxury driving is.If you do drive pay attention to the road and use your indicators, instead of listening to the radio, texting, drinking coffee or adjusting your heated seats. Pay attention and you WILL see cyclists and pedestrians, who are the heros who dont create traffic, pot holes or take up parking spaces etc .If you find that you keep moaning about other drivers, you are most probably the problem.If you dont understand why cyclists do what they do try bursting your lungs out in the cold and rain instead of depressing your big toe on the accelerator of a nice warm car, and you too will also learn the difference.Road Bullies or Road Heros
TopGear Brilliant, Short, Simple, Effective.
TopGear The semaphore are god lets obey!
TopGear hehee. We love Top Gear in our house, I especially like reading Clarkson  Gills vacation articles.Those damn cyclists though, holy shit theyre a lot worse than those speeding, red light running, fast lane hogging, cell phone yapping, stereo blasting, face stuffing, tailgaiting, make up applying, misaimed headlight blinding, reading(!), cant stop crashing into each other, 1 million dogs a year hitting, 4000 pedestrians a year killing, literally couldnt stop behind the crosswalk or keep it in their their own lane if their very life depended on it automobile drivers.Well, they annoy me more, at any rate.
TopGear You see, all the ignorant foreigners asking why should you stop for lights, thats why the UK has far superior drivers and one of the smallest traffic fatality rates in the entire world.
TopGear Cyclist are really fucking stupid, they ride in the middle of the road thinking all cars will yield to them and they dont stop for traffic light. Fucking idiots
TopGear Was hoping to see the planning of it. Christ on a bike! I thought it was just a metaphor but then Jesus comes riding a bike past them, rofld.
TopGear Disliked, promotes the stupid Us vs Them mentality.
TopGear I wish all cyclists got blown up to be honest.
TopGear Unless youre redgreen colourblind  then youre fcked.
TopGear An important lesson for cyclists: Top Gear Bicycle Advert
TopGear Drivers. 30 and 40. Learn the bloody difference!
TopGear Hammod dyed his hair! :P
TopGear must see full episode!
TopGear this is one of the greatest cameos ever 8D
TopGear Richard, Jeremy and James on Phineas and Ferb, AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! :D
TopGear TIL TopGear is making a cameo in Phineas and Ferb
TopGear Love Top Gear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear PPPPPPOOOOOOWWWWWWEEEEEERRRRRRRRRR !!!
TopGear get the top gear guys to commentate Formula 1 hehe
TopGear Omg. They totes made them look younger lol.
TopGear I love the fact that Disney got Jamess shirt right.
TopGear this is the only reason why Im watching the full episode
TopGear Them pronouncing Heniz last name lol
TopGear Shouldnt the stig have been somewhere in the background?
TopGear Permission to say oh cock
TopGear Shouldnt there be someone in a white fire suit in the background, with a fedora on top of his white helmet? That would be Agent S. (Some say he works for an organization without a cool name. All we know is...)
TopGear I just watch this on TV just now an decide to look it on TV. Disney never put any adds saying these people were even going to be on this show.
TopGear Uhh.. Thats utterly ridiculous
TopGear Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond y James May,
TopGear I bet they Complained about the standing start
TopGear Now I have a reason to watch this show.
TopGear Doofen....Disch.....Koenigseggsegegseeessgsgggsggs?
TopGear Some say, that he moonlights as a secret agent platypus,..And that his primary mode of transportation, is a shark equipped with tires...
TopGear 0:33 lol agent shark LOlolOlol
TopGear Two of my favorite shows (Top Gear and Phineas and Ferb) in one?? MUST WATCH FULL EPISODE!!!
TopGear Oh this ought to be good! Has the episode come out yet? Thanks for sharing this with us and Jesus loves you! For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16
TopGear you know its gonna be awesome when Jeremy, Richard, and james are in this
TopGear If Dr. D was the next guest star in a reasonably priced car, his name on the board would be Heinz Doooofffeennnnnshhmmmirrrriiiiirrrrrrrttttttttszzzzzzz :P Just like how the spell Koenigsegg.
TopGear Found it entertaining straight away so I stopped the video. Now gonna watch it on iPlayer before its taken down. :P
TopGear Lee Mack banishes some very famous faces to the depths of Room 101! topgear room101
TopGear Yes, another reason to hate Lee Macks guts!
TopGear Gutes Video bitte mach mehr knntest echt gut eine Talk Show leiten.Wrde mir die Talk Show immer anschauen hehe :D
TopGear Top Gear hat einen Youtubekanal, bei dem Sie sich gut und gerne 420h aufhalten knnen. Alles auf englisch und um Lngen schner als auf deutsch
TopGear irgendwie hrt man dem typ verdammt gerne zu...
TopGear hem, ich schau das immer im Original. Falls es Fragen gibt wie das geht, einfach melden.
TopGear 10:31 Schwachfuchs den Ausdruck werde ich mir merken.
TopGear aber nur nen TATAdiesel...))
TopGear Leider senden die besagten Sender Top Gear nur mit deutscher Sychronisation aus... das kann man leider nur noch als furchtbar bezeichnen.
TopGear MchtegernRennwagen? Naja, wenn man bedenkt, dass Peugeot zur Zeit nach AMG die zweithchste Literleistung bei Serienwagen auf die Beine stellt, wrde ich diese Aussage an Ihrer Stelle noch mal berdenken ) UNd der 208 GTi ist mMn ein wrdiger Nachfolger fr den legendren 205 GTi.Und dass der AmiAbklatsch kacke ist, sollte klar sein. Machen nur scheisse und knnen nur geradeaus fahren, objektiv zu bewerten ist denen Typen nicht mglich... Die sollen erstmal ihre eingenen Schrottkisten verbessern, bevor man ber die europischen Autos meckert
TopGear Auer dem Namen haben die beiden Sendungen mMn eigentlich nicht viele Parallelen. TG UK hat fr mich(!) unglaublich viel Charme. Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond und James May sind drei Charaktertypen, mit denen sich jeder irgendwie auch identifizieren kann. Ich finde es unglaublich unterhaltsam, wie die Drei mit smtlichen verfgbaren Klischees und Vorurteilen spielen. Egal ob sie sich dabei nun auf Personengruppen, Lnder oder Automarken beziehen. Klar, es geht der ein oder andere Witz etwas unter die Grtellinie, aber nach so etwas gieren die Zuschauer. Es bringt schlicht etwas Abwechslung in das sonst sehr weichgewaschene und sozial korrekte Fernsehprogram. Die deutsche Synchro ist allerdings Mist :)TG USA hingegen ist fr mich nur ein schlechter Abklatsch vom Original. Die Protagonisten sind schlicht langweilig und die Sendung dreht sich letztendlich nur um das Hochhalten der amerikanschen Flagge. Es gabgibt brigens noch TG Russia, South Korea und Australia. Sehr erfolgreich scheinen diese allerdings nicht (gewesen zu) sein.Auch in Deutschland hat man sich in der Vergangenheit um hnliche Formate bemht. Die meiner Meinung nach beste Umsetzung gab es mit DMotor. Leider wurde diese Sendung mittlerweile abgesetzt. Die drei Protagonisten hatten aber immerhin einen Gastauftritt bei TG UK in einer Sondersendung.
TopGear Top Gear UK find ich klasse, danke fr das Video.Herr Lning, ich wrde gerne ihre Meinung zum aktuellen SUVBoom wissen. :)
TopGear Unfug  Schwachsinn  Schwachfug
TopGear Richard Hamdon und James May  Captian Slow
TopGear Es gibt auch Top Gear Australia
TopGear Topgear ist reine Show. Der Zuschauer soll unterhalten werden, mehr nicht. Und das machen sie auch recht gut.Dass die Rennen die sie da machen nur Spa sind, sollte jeder wissen.
TopGear Herr Lning, wie wre es mal mit einem Video ber Prepper? Sie selbst legen doch auch Vorrte und hnliches fr den Ernstfall an. Mich wrde mal ihre Meinung dazu interessieren, in Amerika scheint es weit verbreitet zu sein.
TopGear als Clarkson damals den 911er maltrtierte und schlielich vom Kran fallen lie warsfr mich gelaufen
TopGear Top Gear gucke ich mir immer online auf der Website vom BBC an. Da man sich die Sendungen mit einer deutschen IP nicht ansehen kann, muss man sich jedoch ber einen UKProxy verbinden.Ich habe mir letzte Woche erst die aktuelle Staffel zu Ende angesehen. Die beiden BirmaSpezialsendungen waren auf jeden Fall sehenswert!
TopGear O que meu vdeo est fazendo ai sem as devidas fontes?
TopGear Even when its not used seriously, this song always gets me a bit tearyeyed.
TopGear hahahahahahahahahahaha they could have put a Prius at the end too
TopGear Spot on  well done Top Gear!
TopGear 4 people who think theyre always right
TopGear I need a .... motherfuckers. at the end :D
TopGear personally i think thats one of the best PIFs ive ever seen....it gets the point accross in a hard sharp way....1010 to the lads for this
TopGear Take a look at this video on YouTube:
TopGear LOL! I watched this on the show last night and laughed so hard.
TopGear LOL! This is so hilarious!
TopGear huh 12 cyclists also watched the video
TopGear Ha ha this is sooo funny... Even though Im a cyclist.. A car driver and a bus driver!!!
TopGear Car drivers that concern you too look both sides anyway dont assume i cant see anything its clear in evry secound you can hit a kid who runs on street do you really want to be a child killer becouse you was to cocksure you have clear path?
TopGear Jako rowerzysta codziennie obserwujcy innych rowerzystw na ulicach, podpisuj si wszystkimi czonkami.

TopGear This is one of your best vids
TopGear 1 of your best Archie!!
TopGear dat face at 3:18 about the Panarai, hahaah classic.
TopGear Haha! Seems you thought as much of it as I did! Like I said in my letter there were only around 5 watches in the whole thing that I would actually wear. Its publications like these that make people think that a shit watch is actually a good watch. Guess Top Gear did ok out of the advertisement revenue though so dont really care!
TopGear I love it....hahaha....
TopGear ...and he wants an Oris diverWHAT THE FUCK? NO ONE WANTS AN ORIS DIVER!!I find Archibald an overbearing, pretentious prick most the time (not that hes trying to be anything other than exactly that) but I have to admit, I had a good laugh at that one. Sign of hardship at Volvo I suppose  head of design aspires own a watch that costs a few hundred quid.
TopGear This has to be Archies all time best rant. LOL funny all the way.
TopGear You should stick to food reviews you fat neck bearded mouth breathing aussie wanker. You are sweating sitting down you disgusting reprobate. You say you are a watch expert and then call maurice lacroix, morris when it is pronounced mooreeeceYou degenerate prick
TopGear Tell us how you really feel Arch!(This vid is one of your best!)
TopGear Archie if you ever come down south (Adelaide ways) I would love to have a drink with you and chat about watches!
TopGear Agree 100, they, like 99 of the population, know nothing about watches
TopGear The presenters probably dont even know anything about the magazine, let alone write for it (well...maybe a foreword). Marketing...yuk!
TopGear From what Ive seen on the show Omega is a big sponsor,Ive the guys wear Bond SMP 300s,Railmaster XXL, Planet Ocean and Speedmaster in professional and Dark Side flavor, also Submariner.
TopGear Archie youre tha MAN. But I really like this dumb fuck Clarkson.
TopGear Haha!!! Classic shit!!
TopGear nice archie! great video
TopGear all marketing analysis... ) 25 of TopGear readers own a Rolex is their reasoning. So looking at it from a albeit nasty marketing POV  perhaps it will make som cheap watches flog
TopGear Thanks Archie!!! One of your best vids...this is the old Archie shit that put you on the map...A...more please.
TopGear I cant believe that theres no mention of an Oris in that magazine.....
TopGear absolutely fantastic, and a really truthfull and funny review!!
TopGear well what did you expect from them )
TopGear I like top gear but that watch magazine was a joke...almost seems like TG needs some extra money to keep going because they obviously sold out to who ever would pay for ad space.
TopGear Classic Archie love the way you talk about the top gear watch book hahaha
TopGear 100 support to my man Archie!
TopGear Agree  Best video yet. Judgemental Archie at his very best. Thank You !
TopGear great vid archi keep em coming knowledable And comedy genious fuk thr haters
TopGear love this video, your the best. The guru, the one, the only, Archie. fuckers. big belly lmao keep up the good work.
TopGear Wow archie in Fire :) love ur comic sense :)
TopGear What a fat load of shit!
TopGear ya need to cut down on the cold cut meats.......
TopGear Was watching top gear right before this. While they know cars they have no fucking idea about watches.
TopGear What a book of fucking LIES!. fucking disgusting book you have there archie!
TopGear I thought a Jazzmaster was a guitar. Must be for jazz musicians. Scraping the barrel for appropriate watch names me thinks. The Speedmaster, GMT Master, Seamaster and Yachtmaster are already taken you fucking arseholes! Whats next, the fucking Bicyclemaster?
TopGear Loud, obnoxious Clarkson, hahaha that is the most hypocritical thing I have ever heard in my life. Strangely enough I agree with you Archie about the quality of the magazine as it was terrible but the way you go about saying it is childish and further proves to me that you are a pompous, undereducated fat prick who spends all of his money on second hand watches and begging for cash on Youtube because he has lost his job as a Waste disposal manager (essentially a bin man).
TopGear Are you aware that people can only afford watches in the magazine? It doesnt claim to be a watch guru magazine. Snobbery. Cheap doesnt mean shit. And by the way, 200 pounds isnt cheap for some people to spend on a watch.
TopGear I dont agree with what you call dog shit but that was still a funny vid.
TopGear Classic rant  nice one, Archie! Pretty impressive to sustain a rant like that over 10 minutes. Go play with your sandtray now.
TopGear Nice one Archie! And thank you Craig )
TopGear Great vid, that dog shot mag is only usefule to wipe the ass after pooping.
TopGear Horrible watches in that magazine Arch, just horrible POS.
TopGear Wow, one of Archies maniacal rants that I actually agree with!
TopGear They advertise dog shit to people that know nothing about watches because most people wont spend over 300 dollars on a watch. People think they will get a good watch when its in fact, like Archie said its dog shit haha.
TopGear GREAT point at the end there, Archie. Top Gears gone to the shitter.
TopGear I hope top gear get you on star in a reasonably priced car :D
TopGear Ive seen Richard Hammond wearing a submariner and a top gun
TopGear Actually not as bad as most mens magazines watch recommendations. At least there were some priced for less than 1K. Sometimes its all 10k fashion watches.
TopGear The guides dogshit then?
TopGear No matter the topic Archie always brings the passion. I love these posts. Keep up the great work Archie. PS. I would love to hear you critique anything with a few drinks in you. Youre the best!
TopGear brilliant :) am gonna make a fresh coffee and zoot for this one :) top man craig !! see you at triplicity ? your on the guestlist )
TopGear Lol, classic Archie...pure gold
TopGear This just has to be Archies best video!
TopGear Jeremy Clarkson is too busy making fun of Piers Morgan getting fired to care about some watch book. Besides I think Ive seen Jezza wearing a Omega most of the time on top gear.
TopGear The good thing about Clarkson is that he punched Piers Morgan in the face. ANYONE that punches Piers Morgan in the face gets a lifetime pass for ANYTHING. I would pay a years salary to box Piers Morgan
TopGear HEY! Dont badmouth GM V8s like that, let alone compare it to an ETA Movement!, V6 though fine that would make sense but they made some pretty awesome V8s over the years.The Buick 455 and the 454, the versitile and long lasting 350 CI V8 that allowed the Corvette to survive the 1970s despite them trying to kill it off and short changing itBook Club: Corvette Sting Ray  Jay Lenos GarageAmerican Muscle CarS1E07Buick Gran Sportand there was alot of love and tender care that went into it from Bob Lutz in 1976 after Zora left in 1974 with a Blue 454 Convertible, that he kept for many years afterwardsand all of those great all around crate motors they make nowadays, so if your gonna bad mouth some GM motor, pick the right one, namely the V6s Of which I had one crack on me, the engine block cracked right through, straight in half!I mean of all the damn things you could pick on, you choose the ONE solid part about an american GM car, the damn V8!hell even on that Holden the V8 is probably the best part of it!
TopGear if you think a GM V8 is cheap and nasty, you havent driven a Corvette
TopGear This is one of your best vids! I almost peed myself! NICE ONE ARCHIE

TopGear Did they all inhale a bunch of helium?
TopGear Its amusing how the voices are sped up just enough to make them all sound ... adolescent. :)
TopGear Hate the new tundra. But man they can take a beating. I own an 05 and that thing just wont quit :)
TopGear mmmm...... i think the tundra did pull the endeavor but im not sure?
TopGear the tundra is the best pick up truck it did actually pull the endeavor
TopGear is that the same stig as in the uk top gear? or is he an american stig?
TopGear why are their voices high?
TopGear dude whats with changing the voices it makes it like shit man , just stop acting smarts and upload proper videos .dickhead
TopGear I dont know what it is but its not the real voices kind of makes it suck
TopGear what happened to the voices????
TopGear Why all video quality so shitty? Either the image is off focus, the sound is too high of low pitched or both
TopGear I like all your videos man i wonder if you still make any more
TopGear Something is wrong with the audio it is like a minute and a half off
TopGear whats with their voices?
TopGear they sound like they shit trough their mouth hahah!! topgear gb is so much better
TopGear Why the voices are so weird in your channel? Youre retarded?
TopGear Its because the copyright
TopGear Wtf do u make the video quality sooooo bad
TopGear I cant explain how awesome you guys are.
TopGear Why is this such a crap recording with crap sound and visual noise all over it?
TopGear Rutledge won the gas battle
TopGear You should do this to star trek
TopGear Thanks for narrating Alvin
TopGear is it only me getting this kinda uglyfunky sound???
TopGear yes all us English lie!! I love the usa and everything it stands for ) why if your car goes up to 190 would that be the end of your speedo
TopGear Every top gear us they have the voices changed in not great
TopGear Nice. I have seen this video but now i cant find the original one anymore. Thanks.
TopGear They copy Top Gear UK on everything, so unoriginal.
TopGear The roads in Burma are bad enough, never mind having Fisher Price roads that baby children have made!
TopGear This was the best episode ever! This show Is my no.1 show
TopGear Babies are no good at building roads. Ha!
TopGear I dont have BBC America in my TV, solution?
TopGear I enjoyed watching this special but it definetely wasnt the best special ever as Hammond says.
TopGear its was a very good episode. good job BBC america. good job top gear guys :D
TopGear The funny thing about Richard Hammond rocking that ring beard is that he looks like Steve Pizzati, one of the Top Gear Australia Presenters
TopGear Pro Australan ? .. wtf kdy to ml bt dj wich :) .
TopGear i fucking burst out when he called him tesco
TopGear haha James: auauauau D
TopGear What does self reliance have to do with riding a Horse? Knowing all that you can from ancient civilizations  ways of doing things. Do I know Latin? A dead language? Some....It is not by any means dead to the Scientific community, just not common as it once was.You dont know where your going, if you dont know where youve been.(Forgive me, I dont know if that is the exact quote.)
TopGear Hello horse! I shall call you Tesco! ROFL
TopGear I waited so long for Top Gear to ride ponies, i died from laughter XD
TopGear What the horses must have thought...
TopGear My whole family was dying with laughter at this part
TopGear OMG, My sides hurt from laughing so hard. How can a grown man not know how to ride a Horse?....on a most basic level? Perhaps this is the definition of Metrosexual?....Human males so far removed from their past as to be so inept? Glue? Horses were moving man  materials thousands of years before the internal combustion engine was even invented!
TopGear At this point, Richards stallion decided to get amorous with Jamess mare.
TopGear Sexiest facking horse ever! I mean... you know when they Mustang was drifting all hardcore and for as long as it could? I got nothing
TopGear Jeremy looks so funny on horse with a tie and all :DD
TopGear Ive seriously hurt my testies
TopGear Clarkson : HOLY MOLY!
TopGear Clarkson is bigger than his horse.
TopGear Bad move putting a stallion in with mares, as they found out but fck that was funny, I think they should stick to what they know before one of them gets killed?! Watching Jeremy  James on those ponies...Pissed my sides laughing but I hope that the Hamster is ok, thats another series knock on the head hes had but Clarkson tearing a ball, Mmmm, could it be Karma for the insult???
TopGear One of the best top gears in years. Havent seen 2nd part yet just hope its has Gd as the 1st.
TopGear now the stig will Tesco around our track,, some say ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TopGear A toyota hiace super grandia van near the end???
TopGear May: aw, aw, aw, aw, aw, aw .LOL
TopGear I feel bad for the horses..
TopGear I shall call you tesco
TopGear Haha 5 legged stallion.
TopGear Spoiler AlertThe best part where they finally found out that they build the bride over the river named KoK
TopGear Jeremy:  Ive bought a reversing horse!Me: laughing so hard
TopGear 1:15  Im creasing!!! :)
TopGear Hello horse, I will call you Tesco
TopGear Isnt Burma called Myanmar now?
TopGear Im no expert but those look like some small horses
TopGear Jesus....I mean Buddha :DDD
TopGear Tesco the reversing hirse :D
TopGear ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, i have watched this clip too many times now, but i still crack up every time.
TopGear wish top gear uk will make an episode here in philippines !hehe
TopGear Thats a pony yet with a penis size of a human arm? :O
TopGear Top Gear goes horse back  Top Gear Burma Special: https:youtu.beQ5qSHXvqXDg
TopGear I couldnt stop laughing XD Hahahahahahhaha
TopGear Lol ....capt. slow is so funny
TopGear These werent horses they were ponies. The only one not too big for them was Richard and even he looked silly on them. Still it made me laugh. Just the sight of enormous Jeremy on that little pony brought tears to my eyes. Hilarious!
TopGear the only fucking reason he thinks they should be glue, is because the horse isnt a horse, its a pony and he could fucking flatten it cause hes too fucking big for it!
TopGear Just cant stop laughing. Its hurts..but its still so funny. maybe its to milk itself!..man, the more I think abt, I just start laughing all over again. Brilliant, just brilliant .
TopGear I can see why they should be glue these things haha
TopGear Hello horse. I shall call you Tesco
TopGear Jesus!  I mean Buddha!James May will be reborn as a turd.
TopGear Omg every freaking part if this video has my dying XD XD
TopGear Good thing theres only one horse power so the ride wont be bumpy.
TopGear I feel so sorry for those horses.
TopGear I am dying to see the full episode of this.. I couldnt stop laughing this was bloody hilarious!
TopGear goddd ,me laughin like an idiot,,and my dad,,,,,is like what the fuck are you doing!!!!,,,,,and offcourse me laughin moree and moree
TopGear James: Jesus... I mean Budda!
TopGear such fucking idiots, they arent fighting, they love each other...
TopGear You guys r so stupid, its cuz stallions get exxcited just like humans do, dont u ever get a boner?
TopGear 3:47  Prius in the background. :P
TopGear They had a good approach. And then they started cycling.
TopGear May I use your restroom, my scrotum is on fire The woman probably thought he was asking to go in there and rub one out lmao
TopGear topgear still the best thing on television.
TopGear I know I always count on the boys!!!!
TopGear lol their PSAs were hilarious. topgear is the best
TopGear 4:50 Richard clarkson is hella funny
TopGear Holland is the best, drove there once, I nearly ran over 10 cyclists.
TopGear i wanna see the Full James May bycycle maintenance video
TopGear why did you get city bikes those things are worthless they dont have suspension and only 3 gears
TopGear Road tax for bicycles, problem solved.....
TopGear What episode is this?
TopGear hashtags on youtube. gee thanks Obama.
TopGear As a cyclist Ive had 3 traffic accidents, since I got a car I didnt crash at all!Except for that one time I thought I could drift round a corner hmm
TopGear topgear awesomeness :D
TopGear James almost hitting that guy in the face, hahaha
TopGear Toothpaste on my privates so she can brush her teeth. ..I wish.
TopGear Wankers! The tags were left on to make them, as cyclists, look stupid. I bet JC even suggested they wear their helmets backwards! JC whinged about his arse cause, after realising how fast it is to get from WC2 to W1 on a bike he couldnt think of anything negative to say about biking around London. Isnt it strange how in the final cut they never showed Tweedles Dee and Dum passing the 3040 cars which EVERY cyclist does when they go biking through London for twenty minutes.How long did it take JC to stop, park up and get his scotum sorted? 30secs on a bike, fuck knows how long that would take in a car. But he wouldnt get sore balls in a car, so there. I hear you carlovers say. Yeah, yeah, whatever. The bloke is such a lard, he gets sore balls waiting behind a bus in his 125,000 6.3litre AMGengorged penis.Please search out Stewart Lee, Why I hate Top Gear for a somewhat accurate appraisal of the Tweedles.
TopGear yes, it is dangerous if you ride on wrong side of the road.
TopGear Bumps... am there is a sulotion well actually 2 !  Well Suspenchion  BMX(bad Spelling :P )
TopGear i love when they still have tags on clothes
TopGear Lance Armstong LOOOL!
TopGear Maiq tried to cycle once, but Maiqs tail got stuck in the back tire. This was very uncomfortable to Maiq.
TopGear hahahaha! napaka antipatiko lang talaga e
TopGear Toothpaste on your scrotum must be a generation thing
TopGear Take a look at this video on YouTube:
TopGear Getting worst every year
TopGear the best of Jeremy Clarkson...
TopGear Waiting for series 22. Burma was good too.
TopGear The boys REALLY need to invest in some serious protection for their gentleman sausages. They always seem to complain about their packages. I hate to see poor Richard loose his chance of having a son.
TopGear Work Harder get a car!?! Ha sad fact, my bike cost more than my car.
TopGear As a cyclist, I endorse this message.
TopGear I like Jeremy and James had the clothing tags on their jackets, still.
TopGear Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
TopGear I seem to see the worst drivers on the road cyclist or car driver alike. Ive seen a cyclist drive on the right side of the road where cars drive on the left, the cyclist almost got planted in my windscreen, didnt see him until I pulled out of my road.
TopGear Toothpaste on your scrotum? I thought I was the only one...!
TopGear Random question: Ive noticed that in some top gear clips the clothing on the guys (in this video the bike helmets) still have their tags on. Anyone know if there is a reason for this?
TopGear As a cyclist I would just like to say that this was bloody hilarious. The amount of people that jump red lights and generally dont have a clue what theyre doing is ridiculous. Cycling in the city isnt hard, just show where youre going and people are lenient. Apart from the odd bus and taxi driver, most people are fine
TopGear This was funnier when they were making the advert for the Scirocco.
TopGear 4:40 And James May makes grimaces..........
TopGear You British people dont know what cycling really is... Come to the netherlands and we speak again
TopGear Whats the name of the song of Jeremys clip?
TopGear ....toothpaste on your scrotum?.....?....I am laughing so hard, I cannot breathe
TopGear Just get bicycles with shock absorbers,solves your scrotum problems
TopGear Sharing this rather funny TopGear episode ...
TopGear So what did we learn today?!  get a car!!
TopGear these guyz r simply awsome :) topgearlover
TopGear They wanna make it safe?Like we have in HollandCyclepaths! SOLVED!!!
TopGear Mr. HOPPY! I hope you all get the reference.
TopGear i hate cyclists, germany and china.
TopGear Like how they kept the tags on so they could return them :)
TopGear Really good clarkson Hammond sucks at driving
TopGear Whilst I just... insert this in the machine...I want to see the uncut version, where James goes on a long lecture about how DVDs work.
TopGear LOL I saw this episode yesterday.
TopGear Best show in the world
TopGear Ok, I always drive to opposite lane so I can leave a big gap between my car n the cyclists which can put myself to danger when some cyclists are very considerate to drive in the middle of the lane or during holiday time, they like to cycle side by side with friend s, so why asking us to be considerate when the problem is actually on them?
TopGear Act your age get a porsche
TopGear 3:42 Thats a really nice 500 :)
TopGear How to keep cycling safe in England? Keep Clarkson and May off of bikes XD
TopGear 4:40 everybody..i just cant XD ...breath!
TopGear Jeremy, what on earth are you doing, ...Sigh... looks so wrong... 4:33 i know hes applying the cream to his bum but still LOL
TopGear I nearly hit that bloke in the face
TopGear I use my bicycle everyday. Going to school, training and nearly everywhere else by bicycle. If you do that and for one day e.g your parents drive you to school with their car you realize what a luxury this is... :D
TopGear Why do people think lanes for cars are lanes for bicycles? Its YOU that chose to live in a city, were you surprised when you saw cars driving in car lanes?.. Stay off the road and leave the cycling to country getaways.
TopGear James: Look at him, hes wearing normal clothing the lunatic!Jeremy: YOULL BE KILLED!!!!!
TopGear make cycling saver by driving a car instead lololol
TopGear OMG the videos is just a slap in the face to all those people its so funny!!! Top Gear is the greatest show on earth.
TopGear So what did we learn today?!  get a car!!
TopGear 1:20 what did Jeremy say?
TopGear Great special but doesnt feel as special as previous ones, shame that they have to script most of it makes it look very cheap. Like the scene where hammond is showering with james and jeremys piss and you expect us to believe that really was for real??? People arent that stupid
TopGear The thumbnail is adorable XD
TopGear I love the last part where they build the bridge on River Kok
TopGear Do people even know about BBC iPlayer?
TopGear ohh come on!! wheres the full version :(
TopGear So far...A second comment I have made :D
TopGear hopefully this series is gonna come to germany soon :)
TopGear sir alec clarkson hehe
TopGear Seen the whole series......better than season 20
TopGear is it just me seeing them dressed like michael,trevor and franklin from GTA 5?
TopGear Whats the ending whistle song?
TopGear what name song from 2:18 ?
TopGear Hammond looks like one of the village people.
TopGear what mustard Hammond have on his shirt ? :D .. u could watch these top gear episodes all day long! Best entertainment !
TopGear This has to be the funniest segment theyve done in a while. I so love this show!

TopGear Learn how to pronounce the name of the river. The way you are pronouncing it has a meaning that will make the Thais smile even harder when you say it:)
TopGear that is so weird! i just saw for the first time the old movie bridge on river the kwai like last week
TopGear Where is top gear al of a sudden?! Its not on bbc anymore!
TopGear The Three Comrades, I love them, I swear.
TopGear Do they buy trucks that are nearly broken on purpose so they can complain about them?
TopGear I wanna see more, where are the rest of this, awesome piece of film
TopGear People think this is hilarious. For god shakes, theyve been pulling off same crappy stunts for the last decades...
TopGear this will always be one of the best shows
TopGear Note to self..To a Brit a wife beater with a mustard stain is a vest with egg on it.
TopGear Burmas long distance lorries  Top Gear Burma Sp: https:youtu.bevyPYarCidxM

TopGear )         ,         Marussia b2      ,  Lamborghini Aventador  McLarenLooked totally loved this series) I do not know you read this post or not, but I would like that you tested Marussia b2 along with other sports cars such as Lamborghini Aventador or McLaren
TopGear What kind of old isuzus are clarkson and Hammond driving? I suspect old TY series trucks but Im not sure
TopGear I bet 90 of the things that go wrong on Top Gear are staged.
TopGear Great job guys. I would love to have youre job. Even the miserable parts are a adventure
TopGear if the Top Gear british show is showing in BBC America, what happened to Top Gear America?
TopGear staged or not, its hilarious.
TopGear Great job guys. I would love to have youre job. Even the miserable parts are a adventure
TopGear So Richard only hurt his wrist yes, nothing else?!?!?!?
TopGear 1 horse power..this is rare..lol..
TopGear Well they say youre not a real rider until you have been thrown off at least once. So congratulations, Richard. :) I do hope your wrist gets better soon though. And just for the record... it is SO cool to see some real horsepower on TopGear
TopGear music music music music....concert of music.......

TopGear Did you see sennas 1988 f1 car
TopGear Aw this makes me miss your dad haha! Looks like you had lots of fun. Stop being so perf P
TopGear Check out Darren Maule racing with The Stig
TopGear In Finland the oldest taxis are from 2011. Mostly E:Class Mercs.
TopGear Staged show, auto sitcom for housewifes in pants. Pffff
TopGear This show is so scripted and staged it may as well be a sitcom and a lame sitcom at that.
TopGear Where are the Crown Comforts, Crews and Prii?
TopGear NO! Not the top gear production office!
TopGear In Austria, we have AMG, and SClass Taxis. :D
TopGear Damn, US cab drivers need to step up their fame. We need Eclass as taxi here too instead of the Toyota Prius and old Crown Victorias. In Europe they drive them because those diesel engine last forever and the structure is as strong as a tank.
TopGear What episode is that plz reply?
TopGear Why Captain Slow wasnt driving the English taxi? It would be more appropriate.
TopGear when he crashed to the limo that was fake
TopGear no bigbody toyota cab? its Manilas finest!
TopGear thanks but only they drive like that here in south Africa I would be safe on the roads
TopGear Yeah I think the Indian taxi  the hindustan ambassador modeled off the old morris wins the race.
TopGear Lol..dubai has lambo taxi.
TopGear Why havent Thailand Taxi?
TopGear Whats your thoughts on 3D printer and will you be reviewing them in your channel in the future?
TopGear The vochos us the better
TopGear Its the Indian ambassador that won !!
TopGear Most Crown Vic cabs are retired police interceptors
TopGear you guys forgot the best taxi in the world along with the best drivers, for forgot the great South African taxi, goes any where on road off road at any speed and no road signs or traffic rules apply to them. simple the best !!!???
TopGear When he said chickens are being molested, he sounded like John Green!
TopGear Who uses a stretch limo as a taxi? What would they use as a limo to step up the game from taxis? Maybachs? And to be honest America doesnt just use crown vics anymore, lately Ive seen more Scions and Escapes and Camrys and... well they seem to just use anything nowadays to the point we just dont have a steady taxi anymore.
TopGear Hahahahaha lol Taxi ? TAXI !
TopGear Ive driven the manual for two weeks as a demo but glad I plumped for the auto. I use the paddles on the twisty stuff as I like to engine brake a bit and be in the best gear for pulling out of the corners. Love the car as most other road users just assume its a 120d or something then you pull away when they are doing 70 like they are stationary
TopGear Omg was he driving it in auto?
TopGear That was slow, could have used a faster car. Isnt the automatic 1 series faster than the manual?
TopGear that was a good lap. gotta love the m1
TopGear FIA on stigs suit! 0:45
TopGear The a45 would of won top gear gone so shit
TopGear donald, somebody might know the answer youre looking for , but you turned the reply function off you dip stick.
TopGear That lap could have been improved
TopGear 8 speed automatic.... EEEWWWW! What the hell! Wheres the stick and clutch? You losing your touch Stigie?
TopGear U know what i always wondered. They mentioned that bump on the corner next to the tires before.. said every car has to hit it in order to take the corner perfectly... Why dont they just put tarmac in the space so the cars shock absorber doesnt have to take that unnecessary hit...
TopGear End across the line!)
TopGear You can actually see some skin in his neck :O
TopGear Im really glad theirs a series 21
TopGear Its not a real Stig. Real Stig would have listened to Chineese language lesson or something...
TopGear Stig has proved that the paddleshift buttons on an automatic vehicle are totally useless.
TopGear When I watched this video about the BMW M135i, BBC America had 1,350 video, this video had 135 likes, and the length of this video was 1:35.
TopGear I like the idea of this film angle. Now they need to show what its like in something actually fast like a Ferrari.
TopGear Its not a real Stig. Real Stig would have listened to Chineese language lesson or something...
TopGear Its Burma, not India !!!!!!
TopGear OMG I WANT TO DO THIS!
TopGear I was there on 1st day of the Top Gear Festival in Sydney when Jules doing a car bungee and Im a HUGE fan of Top Gear
TopGear lol he pronounces koenigsegg as koniseg
TopGear Only 1 Hour and 6 Minutes left until Top Gear Series 21 Episode 6: The Burma Special Part 12 airs at 8:00pm on BBC Two in the United Kingdom!
TopGear This guy almost burst my eardrums today when he set the track record. An Aussie hero!
TopGear Something different for us today, we went to the Top Gear Festival and loved the drifting and the fender bender action!
TopGear haha, thats epic. pretty burnouts, who would have thought?!
TopGear i havent seen the dragster on youtube yet :(
TopGear cheers, couldnt make it this year!
TopGear Great work mate, thanks for uploading.
TopGear Its already finished? Wow that was short!
TopGear Top Gear Series 21 is the last Series in the current Top Gear? Thats surprising, I am sure this Studio will be missed.
TopGear I hope they test the Corvette in the next season.
TopGear Koenigsegg one:1 review please :)
TopGear Why are their seasons getting shorter and shorter? only 5 studio episodes. :(
TopGear hey, just to let the britbongs know, Im america a series is the entire run of the show. for us a Season is a Series for you. so us americans heard them say last shoot of the series, makes us think that the show is ending forever.
TopGear Why is everyone crying? Theyre not stopping and there will be a season 22
TopGear I was really hoping for a corvette and gt3 test (among others but those namly)
TopGear They never let James finish a sentence, do they? Hmmm.
TopGear Is this the actual series finale ? Noooooooooo! I love you guys and dont quit top gear! Im crying now :,( :,( :,( why are you closing the doors and turning out the lights and saying we will never be here again?
TopGear Jeremy put your foot down in the Agera R already !! it doesnt get any faster than that. MAKE IT HAPPEN !
TopGear they didnt make a review of the ferrari laferrari yet? what the heck?!
TopGear episodes 6 and 7 are in Burma hence not a studio show
TopGear This one made me laugh the most lmao
TopGear this one is the best i think :)
TopGear Ahhaha. Very good. Also get fat!
TopGear If you cannot read the description then is it fair to abuse the uploader for your own lack of ability to read the description?
TopGear Check out this video on YouTube:
TopGear Its full hd images from Top Gear series21 episode05. The one with the Porsche 918. I have the full video also but naturally posting the full hour long episode would break copyright laws. :)
TopGear This video is not what the title suggests. Simply still images to music. Waste of time.
TopGear 10:21 of wasted time.
TopGear This car does NOT get 70mpg. It gets 30mpg after the battery is empty (any trip longer than 20 miles). Youd be betteroff buying a Prius or CRZ that get around 50mpg no matter how far you drive.
TopGear That is just hilarious. I am sealing the gaps, so no radiation comes in :D
TopGear One questionHammond was pulled over by police,used to stop and accelerate to waste fuel and time and still at last Clarkson was behind him.Staging Failed!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear Jeremy is dead...anyways xD
TopGear I was waiting for the engine to blow. Jeez, thats like 5k miles they put on just in that short stretch.
TopGear A american gas guzzler will do this job easily, own one myself and am proud of it.
TopGear Another boring episode of plain stupidity.
TopGear They are now in hell now the Ukrainians
TopGear Top Granddaddies. And I still love to see them in action.
TopGear Why did you edit out the part where they went into chernobyl and jeremy ran out of petrol near the amusment park?
TopGear where can i see the ending??
TopGear Dear BBC. What Series is this? So that I can buy this when it comes out :D
TopGear The trouble in Ukraine was cause by top gear and top gear only... Its Syria all over again
TopGear Hummer H1  towing a Boeing 777  1 mile per tank!
TopGear I wouldve1) Turn all the lights, radio, aircond to maximum2) Roll down all windows to create wind drag3) Drive with the handbrake up4) Fill the car with a jackshitload of sand, dirt, rubbish
TopGear I thought my trip, by Atlantic City Rail Line, Riverline, Riverline And Bus 407 to the Moorestown Community House, for the Moorestown High School 35th Reunion... and back... was interesting... Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May on their final part of their journey  to Chernobyl in Ukraine, with only their cars as protection against troubling levels of radiation.
TopGear I think radiation is the least of the worries in Ukraine right about now.
TopGear major error on their part, thinking its still dangerous there... In fact the background radiation in the exclusion zone is no more than in the rest of the country, except for a few small hot spots.And those are easily avoided, especially if you stay on the roads.
TopGear Ok, is it just me or didnt Richard, James,  Jeremy go through Syria just before there civil war? Now Ukraine and Russia takes Crimea? I think Putin may be a producer on TopGearconspiracytheory
TopGear Crap cars!And when u have to save fuel, according to them, u must hit the gas and highest revs to be there as quick as possible instead of driving between 20004000 rpm?
TopGear They should have opened the windows
TopGear Whats the song at 6:43 ?
TopGear Top Gear extended thier play yeard to Eastern Europe!! now try that in Syria lol
TopGear They actually do visitor tours to Chernobyl nowadays, its not that dangerous if you dont stay there for too long.
TopGear what happened to Jeremy and James?
TopGear Is it just me or is Hammond short?
TopGear ford transit :((())))))
TopGear Am I the only one that wants to listen to Jamess lectures?
TopGear Whr are all the Protesters?Sorry If any1 is Angry !
TopGear lol ignorant prius owners should hate this episode. :P
TopGear HalfLife 3 Confirmed by James May.
TopGear They are crazy! Ukraine is almost under a brink of war with Russia. Driving towards a ghost town that is filled with radiation. I will tell the producers that they are fired. Putting their lives in danger and the possibility of getting cancer from radiation poisoning. The correct expression to say for this episode since they are from England. HAVE YOU GONE MAD??? Cheers, Flood!
TopGear where can i watch the sequel
TopGear try taping the air filter half way
TopGear WW3 is coming soon. Loads of conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Why not we just set off to Winchester, have a pint of fosters and wait for all this to blow over.
TopGear Anybody know the music at 06:24?
TopGear Captain slow had the right idea.... get the computer to switch into limp home mode... all injectors start injecting fuel all the time, no switching... very clever
TopGear These Video are just too good i love these Guys.
TopGear poor cars.. they are going to break those engines using the rev limiter the whole time
TopGear Aww dacia sandero, luv you May
TopGear Wheres the rest of it!!!!
TopGear As an American who drives a V8 Muscle car, this cars have better fuel efficiency at there worst. My El Camino gets like 16 mpg
TopGear Jeezer, Hamster, and Slowly are the Three Horsemen of the Apocalypse! They go to Syria, the place immediately breaks out into civil war! They go to Ukraine. World War III is about to start there! Stay in Britain, Top Gear, before you kill us all!
TopGear Why didnt they just get the car stuck or crash it so it wont move
TopGear No, Ive changed my mind, it pretty much IS war now.
TopGear F1JunGT they arent trying to save gas theyre trying to use it all. Did you even watch?
TopGear Why dont they just drive laps around the high way, just keep getting on and off
TopGear hands down fukushima is worse.
TopGear Good news! The Dacia Sandero.
TopGear I have the same Ford Fiesta, only in silver. :)
TopGear Am I the only one that is bothered by James terrible description of a half life?
TopGear Song starting at about 4:50 ???
TopGear Roll down all the windows and blast ac that would have made em run out sooner. Bad for sound quality but who cares.
TopGear I loved this episode!
TopGear LIES. Its all setup and scripted. I would love to see what would happen to three regular guys on this kind of road trip, instead I have to watch something which has been scripted back in an office in London then badly acted and trying to pass it off as real and spontaneous but its such obvious lieing BS.
TopGear Why not fill water jugs and carry them. Or bags of concrete. Easiest, just grab a shovel and fill the inside up leaving just enough room for you. You will be lucky just to get it moving,. LOL
TopGear What happened to Jeremy, once he ran out.
TopGear Why not just shift into neutral and rev pointlessly for hours?
TopGear Is it just me, or does a visit by Top Gear increase a nations likelihood to experience domestic unrest? They went through Syria in 2010, civil war broke out in 2011. They visit Ukraine in 2013, and...
TopGear what a pathetic program...dont they understand we need to save fuel ?? what a shit program !!these brits and americans teach us all sorts of advices we dont even ask for....and now what r de doing?? fucking hypocrites
TopGear Good job  well done to Hammond!!!! The look on Jeremys face was priceless...
TopGear I have a feeling that he wasted a ton of gas high revving it and sitting there waiting for the police
TopGear Low speed, high gear, foot flat uses more fuel than low gear, high revs, half throttle.
TopGear That radiation detector was WAY to sensitive....
TopGear I heard a certain Vladimir from Russia is also playing this game with a few of his friends, in military fatigue.
TopGear Lol... Is int it Open for tourist and i head you can shoot at radiated hogs whit a ak47 there
TopGear Great video, as always from Top Gear!! And I want a Fiesta like Hammonds!!
TopGear Turn on the air con. 15.. 25 right there.
TopGear In Ukraine? A total coincidence....Im sure...
TopGear Their cars are the colour of the Russian flag
TopGear where can i watch full episodes if im not from UK?
TopGear BBC pls stop posting some of TopGears videos on BBC channel and some on TopGear channel, its confusing.
TopGear 4:08 the music is new seeds by boards of canada
TopGear disabling the engine management system is the smartest thing he could do.my corsa b guzzles 35 l per 100 km instead of 7. nearly run out of fuel due to air mass sensor problem.
TopGear richards idea is pretty effective! :D
TopGear I LOVE the sound of those 3 Cylinders!!!!!!! Almost like a inline 6, but half. That volkswagen has got good potential. I love the sound of it
TopGear 2:53 OMG i never thought that song would be here,I heard it in GT6 so this is a super surprise!
TopGear good thing they went to Ukraine before SHTF , in the same fashion as the Syrian tour
TopGear 6:26  why was he only at 1500RMP??? what happened to the 6200RPM tactic
TopGear 1:07 Brace yourself winter is coming
TopGear What happened next? Did the other two die of radiation?!
TopGear Fun car, gimme that! :D
TopGear very nice...how much?
TopGear i must say the sound design on this particular clip was amazing
TopGear Surprised they didnt give Hammster a 5pt harness. The man is truly fearless (remembering the Nardo run in the Noble as well)!
TopGear i just booked 2 of these
TopGear Mercedes should never ever change the classic design of that model.Never.
TopGear Like that very much. How much?
TopGear in Indonesia, a lot of flood happened when its rain season..pretty sure that car would be the shit if someone drive that when its flooding xD
TopGear In these conditions, this Mercedes Gwagon suddenly makes a lot more sense than a Range Rover.
TopGear TC9700Gaming You need this mod on SpinTires.
TopGear just going to throw this out there....it was probably absolute hell on the paint haha
TopGear i going down i yelling timber lol
TopGear 1:20 music? I know Ive heard it before.
TopGear 4:20 music? I need to know..
TopGear Its good to see TopGear hasnt sacrificed its ideal of pointless stupidity in favour of the mindless pursuit of viewing figures.
TopGear In conclusion: this car is FREAKING AWESOME!!!
TopGear that reinflation trick is pretty key. no more use for the cigarette adapter air compressor!
TopGear tehs cantre is saudiArabia no abudabe

TopGear What Nathan Drake shouldve used to cross the Rubal Khali in Uncharted 3
TopGear how the hec did this vid get 197 dislikes?? And wonder if could climb up that Dune?

TopGear Richard Hammond tests a 6x6 SUV in Abu Dhabi  To: http:youtu.beQaNk116b2kw
TopGear Look Im up against some crummy pickup truck. This is going to be deeply embarrassing for him.
TopGear TG sucks big time and Hammond tells exactly why. They are simply bunch of stupid oafs.
TopGear He just...sodded off! XD
TopGear I dont understand the attraction to those hideous drag cars, and I am American.
TopGear I would like to see Top Gear do some real drag racing in a pro stock, pro mod or top fuel car. Or even better team up with John Force for some lessons, that would be entertaining to watch!
TopGear that mustache what the f.. youve decided to get older, Richard?
TopGear That was in Las Vegas not Reno
TopGear Jezzas FACE .. Priceless :D !!
TopGear Richard looks really creepy on the thumbnail.
TopGear of course... those ugly cars are modified and if you take it on a track it will blow up...
TopGear Something these Brits need to get in their head when they race on a drag strip in America.If it looks like crap on 4 wheels... there is a big chance its gonna be FASTER.
TopGear Ill upload more Top Gear Video on my second channel :https:www.youtube.comchannelUC9lIU4gWUztUURQzRp8hWeQ
TopGear That car is 4x6 so only rear axles are driving
TopGear Is Richard going to build a 6 wheeled porsche 911 with all 4 rear wheels with dual rear axles being drive wheels? That would be hilariously awesome!
TopGear I live in the western u.s. the six wheeler is perfect for the terrain. Of course, Id add a fifty gallon auxiliary fuel tank.
TopGear I guess hes never seen the 6 wheeled cars that used to race at Indy. 4 steering wheels in front and 2 drive wheels in back. Looked weird, but cornered great.
TopGear THE BEARD MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE A RAPIST.
TopGear He looks like an old man with a beard
TopGear in your face hummer !!!
TopGear HAHA! That W116 monster truck... :D
TopGear With four wheel steering maneuverability would be comparable... I just want to see a Lamborghini body on a monster truck. How hard could it be?
TopGear Why no V8 turbo diesel? Range helps when youre offroad.
TopGear Richard looks ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooolllldd... XD
TopGear Richard looks like Robert Downey Jr.
TopGear Weird how Dodge made a concept 6x6 and when the German company bought them said it wouldnt be viable, pointless and no one would want it....now they make this...bs all the way! Good looking though
TopGear Some spam from a dude hustling. Im sending out my referral link to join this website. You can do surveys and many other different task to earn points. These points can be cashed for giftcard instantly or a check. Its definitely worth the look.http:www.instagc.comstarbardpearceBest in none mobile view.
TopGear Unfortunately the engine is over the front two wheels. The weight should be pushed back. If you could mount the engine in the back? Then make it float!!! Id better stop now.
TopGear Funny.... Also awesome hehehe :P
TopGear This car looks like something a Mad Maxvillain would drive.
TopGear Weird how Dodge made a concept 6x6 and when the German company bought them said it wouldnt be viable, pointless and no one would want it....now they make this...bs all the way! Good looking though
TopGear Me vejo pilotando essa mquina!
TopGear Crazy to race with such a sensitive car in rain.I would be doing donuts!
TopGear second i saw it was wet, with this car, i knew it would be an oversteery lap.
TopGear 1:05 the Stig has skin!
TopGear Nice style bro amazing
TopGear 0:55 if you look closely there is a convenient stand on the camera mans tripod. Its a great place to rest his ginormous balls when filming slower cars.
TopGear That must have been a practice lap. for how fast his wet lap times normally are, that was really bad on some of those corners.
TopGear Thank you for a complete onboard lap !!
TopGear Looks like a handful. Can we see a dry lap?
TopGear That drift out of Hammerhead....0o0
TopGear 1:00 That understeer though
TopGear I have to agree with May, windshield... Please....
TopGear I love the autoblip when he or she down shifts .
TopGear This is the best outofthebox drift car EVER. So long the track is wet. But its England, so most likely XD
TopGear Only on BBC America...ahahah
TopGear One hand steering trough the rain with a car as fast as a lightning bolt, this is incredible! What a true legend!
TopGear I wonder who the Stig is this year, since poor Michael may never recover from the skiing accident.
TopGear Hed do much better on a dry track.
TopGear Le Stig test la mchante 620Rrrrrrrr caterham 620r
TopGear Check out this video on YouTube:
TopGear why it has to be screenshot with shit music?
TopGear Work Harder. Get a Car.
TopGear brilliant just wacthed it, starts 20 mins into s21e05
TopGear does anyone know the song in the background of this advert??? wud really like to kno
TopGear Getting a drivers lesson from Top Gear  Id be terrified. Im like Jack, I quit my driving lessons because my teacher kept shouting at me
TopGear oh my god, cannot wait for this! :D
TopGear OMG Im British so I see the American behind the scenes
TopGear JACK WHITEHALL Behind the Scenes On TOP GEAR  Leaning to Drive!
TopGear I rather prefer a special road trip episode with all 3 the guys in supercars, but this one should be fun.
TopGear Watching this now on BBC America.
TopGear Just finished watching this, it was brilliant :D
TopGear The specials are awesome, particularly Vietnam, Middle East, Bolivia and India for me. This one will be great.
TopGear The song is called Fortunate Son  Creedence Clearwater Revival
TopGear What happened to the cool wall?!!! I saw it last episode.
TopGear more powerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
TopGear I love the special episodes
TopGear fortunate sons HAHAHAHAHAHA
TopGear OMG THIS IS GOING TO BE AWSOME
TopGear loved it, another epic journey with a finale that left me on the edge of my seat! :3 :DD The best show in the world!
TopGear I prefer these ones when they get cheap basic vehicles and go around the UKWorld doing challenges, I find new superhyper cars a bit boring and the guest in the reasonably priced car! lol.
TopGear Na russian language yes? no?
TopGear Song in this trailer is Fortunate Son by Creedence Clearwater Revival, Pink Floyd also features in this episode.
TopGear YES BRING THE PAIN! :D
TopGear Love these episodes!!!!!, Super cars are boring especially the star in the reasonably priced car!
TopGear Sorry I dont get it sending 3 guys  a film crew to Burma  film a staged set up This is being payed with tv licence fees  the same for the American trip completely staged
TopGear What was the song in the background
TopGear Cant wait! Top Gear specials beat any comedy movies!
TopGear oh god this is going to be funny
TopGear They should do one across Australia next.
TopGear I hope top gear will never end!
TopGear what day will this be on cant wait
TopGear Did Richard trying to become Bruce WIllis or at least american ? :D
TopGear The Africa special had to be the best episode by far. I hope these 3 live forever so Top Gear will never end.
TopGear FINALLY! This special is so late.
TopGear Looks like theyve learned nothing from their previous truck challenge. Looks like funny fails are imminent already.
TopGear When is this episode?
TopGear Good special cant wait
TopGear Have you been enjoying the Top Gear Unseasonable Seasonal special?
TopGear Will this just be on DVD or TV ?
TopGear Nice, cant wait to see this upcoming episode
TopGear What is the music in this video ?
TopGear Errr, unsure about this. Way too soon since the trouble over there. Ill be honest, after watching the previous Top Gear specials, they do make it tempting to visit those countries. But Burma? Just three days ago there was an article on BBC News about Rohingya discrimination being policy, not sure if this is the best time to be promoting that country.
TopGear You are right but this one is extrem And making episode there is unacceptable iam taking about agovernment that is killing theme by its army
TopGear best special ever so far in my opinion LOVED THE FIRST PART
TopGear omg ! did james may hair cut ??
TopGear Christ I cant wait for this...
TopGear Anyone know when this is airing or if it has been aired yet?
TopGear Love Top Gear,This one looks amazing
TopGear Looking forward to this
TopGear Please visit the Philippines guys and try driving the jeepney in Manila
TopGear Looking forward to this
TopGear I still maintain that a trans Canada, Trans Russia and Trans Australia might be good ideas, e.g. Here in Kaliningrad, you will attempt to do what the Germans failed to do, reach Moscow in under... days
TopGear I wonder how top gear makes episode in burma while in this country they are killing humanes because they are muslim this is country based on rasism search for burma and happen to muslims there
TopGear India was the best because of hey jude hahahahahahahahahahaha
TopGear I also believe Ryan Dale enjoys being dominated.
TopGear Part 2 of this Burma Special..excellent beyond thoughts!! never have I laughed as much as I have tonight!! Top Gear is the best show...........................................................In the world! :D :D
TopGear i see the showgod and jesus
TopGear my big favorit moment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear things to come? drones attacking cars?
TopGear They should wait for dry day anyway.
TopGear Looks hard to drive.but i guess is fun
TopGear just watched the video of the hennessy venom break the world speed record not bad from the americans huWorlds Fastest: 270.49 mph Hennessey Venom GT I post the video because they have been in talks with top gear to bring it to the legendary test track and have the stig put it through the turns to see what it can do. check it out it brought a tear to my eye I think it will do the same for you.
TopGear cant believe it caught on fire...
TopGear Looks killer, but performs poorly.
TopGear Have to say, I really enjoy the Stigseyeview of a lap. You really get the idea of how hard ol Stiggie works, especially on a wet lap like that one was, as well as the line he takes and how he sets up.Grazie, Top Gear.
TopGear Driving this car around can spell more doom than Hercule Poirot visiting Midsomer.
TopGear An RPM gauge and speedo would make this cooler. Also in the turns it looks like he pulling Gs lol
TopGear The car was offthrottle most of the time even on the followthrough Stig had to use the brakes.The way I see it is this  all the power in the world is useless unless you can control it and put it into good use.
TopGear Its a supercar! Its supposed to catch on fire!
TopGear What Top Gear didnt say: unofficially the fastest car on their straight (300 kmh), 060 in 2.6 sec in a car with manual gear and rear wheel drive. The car cant put down more than 400 hp in those conditions. And as for the fire: even highly engineered Porsches catches on fire these days... Just felt like defending my countries only car :)
TopGear REALLY liked the view from the inside! Work it Stigy!
TopGear it looks bumpy as all heck!
TopGear Its a shame a BMW M5 is faster than this in the wet.
TopGear That steering wheel is ugly as hell.
TopGear FINALLY a StigCam with corners!
TopGear As Big, Daft, Orange monsters go that is a big one.But it looks so great.
TopGear He never went any higher than 3rd gear! Get that car on a dry track, I absolutely love it! (even if it spontaneously catches fire!)
TopGear Car looks like a wild animal. Damn danish!!!
TopGear After watching s21 ep4 now you know its normal for supercars to go on fire
TopGear what a crappy car, it sucks on corners because its traction control sucks so much its like it doesnt work.
TopGear Show more like that!!!
TopGear you can hear dat turbo:)
TopGear Looks like a crossbreed between an R8 and an ISF.
TopGear The design and styling of this car is amazing but the drivability and control are terrible .
TopGear That thing is a handful. Id like to see a dry lap.
TopGear you have to test it in the dry you stupid idiots! you would not be satisfied if this was a bugatti veyrons lap because everyone wants to know a dry time and not a wet!
TopGear THe StigCam is really cool
TopGear The weather conditions look horrible for a car that has 1000 hp. I guess the Zenvo isnt the easiest car to drive either.
TopGear To much power for a shit setup and Chassis, no grip even in the dry cant put the power down. Might as well restrict it to 200bhp
TopGear Many unrefinement. So no quality. Much denmark. Very fire. Wow
TopGear he slows down on purpose!
TopGear Vaya coche... es inconducible
TopGear como sopla el turbooo
TopGear They should wait for dry day anyway.

TopGear Its quieter than I would have expected, from a supercharged twin turbo

TopGear I cant even drive my dads regular ass clk55amg in these conditions. Es no fun mane. Raptor when its wet! That being said I dont mind them driving in these conditions because its legit. Es real life mane lol
TopGear Vaya coche... es inconducible
TopGear This sounds familiar.... I dont know why
TopGear Anyone know the song they used at the end of the review for this car?
TopGear I dont like this car as much as I should. Later on in the show they end the Disco Volante scene with the end song for ME3. I died a bit inside as disappointment engufled everything from my intestines to my stomach.
TopGear As soon as I heard the music I jumped straight to my computer to see if it was real or if I was just imagining it :)
TopGear ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL.WE ARE HARBINGER.WE ARE ASSUMING CONTROL.
TopGear If only the car have red and white stripe...
TopGear Mass Effect 3! Awww! hahaha
TopGear Top Gear  Mass Effect... the reapers has no chance
TopGear Lol, I just caught this Episode on BBC Canada, they changed the music. Guess EA Decided to be a dick about the copyright on that music
TopGear Ah yes Top Gear a British tv show about cars and they used a song from Mass Effects soundtrack. We have dismissed this claim.
TopGear Annoying review. He describes the car as Striking, intelligent, and unusual. Well Ill give him the last one. Though strikingly offensively hideous, pompous, and unusual looking are probably more fitting of this particular... Thing. It more closely resembles a lugi, or some sea creature youd expect to see only at great depths where the dark of the ocean would conceal is misshapen nose.Really dont like his offensive references to Jesus either. Great show, bad review.
TopGear MASS EFFECT!!!!! I flipped out when the soundtrack started!
TopGear If while youre driving this car you start hearing voices in your head drive it off a cliff, because you just got indoctrinated! If it turns into a squid shaped killer robot  run for your pitiful life :P
TopGear The headlights are from the Ferrari 599!!! Thats awfull... The car is beautifull, but that killed it...
TopGear I am SO glad that they went for an orchestral soundtrack for ME 3, the music for the first two games were alright, but 3s blows them out of the water.
TopGear hehe awesome use of music! also. Nice profile pic. actually hit my screen trying to get what i thought was a spider off it :P
TopGear Oh good, I am not the only one who noticed they used the ME3 music on Top Gear.
TopGear soooo did they pay for the track?
TopGear I think most of the people who came here are Mass Effect fans. like myself :D
TopGear When you look at this astonishing piece of art in form of a car and the music makes this more important than it is then you understand that this game was not just the best of all time but an emotional landmark for most of us!
TopGear My name is commander shepard and this is my favourite video on the entire citadel
TopGear Im Commander Shepard and this is my favorite vehicle.
TopGear Thanks for putting up the intro, but none of the actual driving, which is the only part I actually wanted to see.
TopGear Goosebumps all over when I heard it... Lot of wrong with ME3 but the music is just epic and fits so well to this piece... well done topgear . Love the car too!
TopGear THIS IS COMMANDER SHEPARD AND THIS IS MY FAVOURITE SHOW IN THE GALAXY :D
TopGear I jumped out of my seat when the soundtrack started.
TopGear they removed this track from the US broadcast :(
TopGear Most of the music from Top gear and Mass effect is called Stock Music. Basically music that is made for general use with cheap licences
TopGear Im Commander Shepard, and this is now my favourite car on the Citadel.
TopGear What can you tell me about the reapers?
TopGear you know what this means....half life 3 confirmed?
TopGear Uptake perfect music for the presentation of the car ... Great Job Top gear
TopGear Shepard its a dooms day reaper devise
TopGear NO YOU BUFFOONS, THAT MUSIC IS FOR MASS EFFECT ONLY!
TopGear Sounds like disappointment
TopGear Some say he punched a reporter in the face ...twice. All we know, hes called Commander Shepard.
TopGear Where is the full video??
TopGear I would kill someone just so they could haul me over to jail in one of these :)
TopGear EA needs to make a Hot Persuit: Dubai. They dont have to make up any fancy police cars either. Its all laid out for them.
TopGear Bet you a 6x6 after hes seen it, he went on to buy one for himself too.
TopGear FYI everybody police chases are banned in Dubai these cars are for display purposes only, I am born and raised there so yeah.
TopGear The Dubai police force must have hands down the coolest fleet of police cars of any police department on the planet
TopGear He should be grateful for actually getting pulled over by a lamborghini. I wouldnt mind. :)
TopGear Hes driving an Aventador police car and yet he thinks a 6wheeled truck is unusual?
TopGear Love his reaction when the FF and SLS are driving up
TopGear Dubai Police Need for Speed.
TopGear Im so happy Im Emarati
TopGear 00:02 the siren answers him
TopGear I like the design Top Gear  Richard Hammond gets stopped by a Lamborghini Aventador Police Car
TopGear The cars are for you people to go and visit dubai.. They are not for actual police work.. Its a marketing decision, not a security decision.Its the guys who market dubai as a tourist hub that came up with it not the chief of police...
TopGear lol Dubai is a joke. They just want to have the largest this and the most expensive that.
TopGear 0:14 is that an Indian Bajaj Pulsar Dtsi that crosses in the frame ?
TopGear dude your fucking spider looks awsomee hahahah is fucking real!
TopGear Just big children playing with their toys...!! Enjoy...
TopGear Crikey! Its the Arabic rozzers!
TopGear It will be interesting to see what will happen to Arabs economy when the oil runs out.....
TopGear This is clearly advertising!! :Dnot topgear though.. )
TopGear yes offcourse we can do that, in times that oil is plenty!!! NOT
TopGear Maiq would be questioning how his taxes were being spent if he seen those rolling around.
TopGear Please what does he sat at 0:22 ?
TopGear We need cop cars like that in the US!!!!!! no more crown Vics
TopGear AFTER SEEING THIS I WANT TO BE A ARABIAN COP NOW
TopGear Was no one else creeped out by this guys profile pic?
TopGear Yeah why not spend some money on a bit more classy uniforms as well, no?
TopGear Does the Dubai Police have a Veyron??? An Agera??
TopGear My middle name is Arabic and Im not Arabic, hmmm all these years I thought my mom was weird maybe she knew something I didnt. I need to get that job pronto
TopGear I want to be a police man in Dubai now.
TopGear Thats such a waste of money that you could spend on something that your country could actually benefit from
TopGear The only reason to be a police man over there
TopGear Hammonds reacton to those rozzers are EPIC!
TopGear So the million skyscrapers arent enough to show off the wealth?! They also have to give highend sports car fleets to the police?! I bet even Dubai has povertystricken people. Why not spend some of that money on them.
TopGear Policia de Dubai esa va a ser mi profesion... jaja
TopGear the thing is that its never going to work with an automobile because they pull to the side. the trick to doing the trick is to pull the tablecloth down.
TopGear Wondering how an electric car like a Tesla would perform with max torque from zero speed.
TopGear what if this went wrong
TopGear James what are you doing?
TopGear Near the start of mass effect 3 where the Normandy leaves earth to get help :)
TopGear what if this went wrong
TopGear James what are you doing?
TopGear Near the start of mass effect 3 where the Normandy leaves earth to get help :)
TopGear Thats a great toy to play with! Would love to have one! No, not speaking about the Alfa!
TopGear Stupid and borong show. A rave between two vehicles that noone actiually bys to race. Bloody idiots
TopGear Best line ever:Cue the Bond!
TopGear That Quadski is one of the coolest toys theyve ever used for a race :D
TopGear Still, could be worse..
TopGear Why dont they upload the clips to Top Gears own channel?
TopGear I cant stop watching this, its so freaking cool!
TopGear Dammit, I wanna see the rest!
TopGear Fuck theyve dumbed this show down over the years. It used to feel spontaneous and fun, and unscripted even though it probably was. Now they treat their audience like theyre total fucking morons!
TopGear came here cuz of the bond theme...and cuz i love tg and alfa romeo
TopGear How much is that jet skicar?
TopGear what the name of the song .
TopGear Shit that Alfa is sexy.
TopGear I rather have the jet ski
TopGear jeremy clarkson as james bond...hmmm...
TopGear Nice video..I do reviews on cars too. Check it out )
TopGear haha, stupid smoke face!!
TopGear I thought jet skis were cool. I thought quads were cool.
TopGear damn, alfa 4c is really beautiful
TopGear I cant wait to see what happened next
TopGear Around 5:43 is hilarious, lol
TopGear Around 3:15 theres a Ferrari passing Hammond
TopGear I just watched it on tv
TopGear Fuck that Alfa is bloody sexy
TopGear this is wauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!!!
TopGear Bond theme song just makes me smile.
TopGear I love Top Gears challenges.
TopGear Hate it because who won?
TopGear Jeremys film knowledge is pretty good, recreating that scene from the spy who loved me where Roger Moore speeds to Atlantis on a jet ski
TopGear hold on a sec...... I just noticed something I didnt earlier. At around 3:14or so, passing by the Alfa, is a red Ferrari.
TopGear A kidney belt, for the swells in the windy part of the lake , eye protection for anything that flies skips and jumps, helmet for same in ATV mode and maybe life preserve r ? Just for fun how many things might be wrong in picture :) seat belt for Alpha driver ?
TopGear Top Gear has 100 Jumped The Shark! This is such a far cry from what made the show great. Compare this crap to the Audi A8 single tank of fuel from 10 years ago. Time to hit reset button Boys.
TopGear I absolutely adore this car. And Italy in the background? Perfection.
TopGear By now.. lotus elise sucks..
TopGear And another good new...Alfa is preparing a hotter version with 2.0 liters engine and about 320 hp.
TopGear If they tried this in the states, Clarkson would have to be wearing a helmet and a life preserver. Plus the atvjet ski would be slower with all the required smog controls.
TopGear What is the music at 1:27 and 1:36 ?
TopGear Who else notices the Ferrari 360 on 3:15???
TopGear What is the name of music at the beginning with the awesome beat?
TopGear Hammonds smug face at 4:04 :))))
TopGear 4:04Thats the most perfect impersonation of Clarkson I have EVER seen in my ENTIRE life!!! XD XD XD
TopGear why do they only put op half of the clips D:
TopGear At 3:15 theres a ferrari 360 modena and a porsche 991 911 pulling out:)
TopGear Wow, such a beautiful car... for just 45k quid ?? That is definitely worth buying.
TopGear Alfa 4c is porn on wheels. In a good way
TopGear We have to love Alfa, its the law !  true.
TopGear The 4C is simply a Diamond! Love Alfa Romeo!
TopGear quentyn73 are you stupid .. this is the best show on tv .. and if you dont agree youre an idiot
TopGear Hammond complains about the Alfas width,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,short arse specific!
TopGear Fuck theyve dumbed this show down over the years. It used to feel spontaneous and fun, and unscripted even though it probably was. Now they treat their audience like theyre total fucking morons!
TopGear Mitico Jeremy!!! ahahahah, fantastico......
TopGear Guarda questo video su YouTube:
TopGear che gioia che mi d Top Gear!
TopGear top gear  il piu bel programma riguardante il presente e le auto
TopGear siiii! togliete quel cavolo di dynamo!
TopGear Finalmente, inizia con gli cinesi al posto degli inglesi. Aspettiamo con onore la 18 stagione. Top Gear
TopGear Finalmente! Ilprogrammapibellodelmondo sul canalepiubellodelmondo topgear
TopGear :Qnientaltro... finalmente mi rimetter a vedere un po di tv...
TopGear Omgawsh Tamanna is soo perfect
TopGear There is nothing better in life than sharing and seeing passion. This is why they are Top Gear.
TopGear So, whats the big deal again?
TopGear h3 and that porsche have nothing to do with the word supercar
TopGear The tractor at the end :Depic win :)
TopGear This is very common in Los Angeles
TopGear anybody know the soundtrack
TopGear Fendt simply the best
TopGear The Fendt is a 250000 Machine, Id go for it over the Others :)
TopGear I would want the Fendt tbh...
TopGear Knowledge is everything
TopGear Lame. Done 100x times. And lame.
TopGear That Fendt 936 Vario is worth more on the market then other three vehicles combined.
TopGear Great Idea by Top Gear!!
TopGear the best automotive tv show on the planet. :)
TopGear Ok, ferrari is a super car. A little old, but still a nice supercar. But the porsche and especially that HUMMER? I would rather go by bus, which is maybe faster and more fuel efficient then that useless hummer.
TopGear i think supercar owners in london should do this once all together!!
TopGear Hamars are shit they wast patrol and has a low amount of horse power
TopGear TOP GEAR go to croatia
TopGear Ey BBC that is NOT a tractor you should have used the New Holland t 8 that is a tractore
TopGear Supercars are not sports cars like in this video, Supercar are worth millions, like bugatti,koenigsegg,mclaren etc...these are just middleclass sportscars
TopGear Something Ive been part of, and it felt AMAZING!!!! :D I loved it!!
TopGear I thought the last big surprise was Bugatti Veyron!!!
TopGear WOW. Please do this here in Singapore too. I would gladly help.
TopGear Uhh... are H3s considered exotic in Europe? I drive a H3x Alpha (with almost 100hp more than the I5 version in this video) as a daily driver and I would call it the antithesis of supercar. I love it, Ive owned two, but even I dont think its anything worth getting excited about. Haha. Very strange to me to see it highlighted like this. But thats cool I guess! Maybe Im spoiled.
TopGear Next time in Finland?
TopGear Great job Top Gear! For making other peoples day!
TopGear Man that fendt is worth more then a honda ciciv wow
TopGear i like the music can anybody tell me whitch band is playing the music?
TopGear Chevy Camaro is better looking than both of these terrible looking cars the Ferrari is gay and the Porsche looks tacky
TopGear Then the corvette pulls up and everyone takes a pass haha
TopGear Nice bit of posing boys, lets show those poor ex communists what our life is all about?
TopGear When are you coming to Mxico :D
TopGear I hope there is gonna be a Top gear Romania
TopGear Hummer H3? A supercar? Hah!
TopGear Does a H3 cost 100k in Slovenia with all the shipping cost and taxes?
TopGear So, whats the big deal again?
TopGear kot da bi kloarjem kampe daju hahaha
TopGear Man that fendt is worth more then a honda ciciv wow
TopGear Muy buena onda ojala todos pudieramos llegar en un auto de estos a nuestro trabajo
TopGear Fendt 936 Vario :) najboli
TopGear It will be very nice to ride a Ferrari. I can imagine it. I like it, especially the Red Ferrari. Very nice
TopGear This was seriously the funniest episode yet! I couldnt breathe from laughter. :D
TopGear Brilliant. Im laughing as hard as Matt Damon and Bill Murray!
TopGear First commenter and lol
TopGear His whole face is red! lol
TopGear I didnt know what a jumper was until I watched Harry Potter! ....this was hysterical!
TopGear Brilliant. Im laughing as hard as Matt Damon and Bill Murray!
TopGear The 24 hours at Silverstone was great because all that exhaustion allows us as viewers to get past the TV personas, especially of Hamster and Jezza, and really SEE who they are. I still remember the end of that race, where Jeremy is beside himself with emotion (YOU BRILLIANT LITTLE CAR!) and theres a quick shot of Richard sporting a smile which would shame the Cheshire Cat. That smile positively screamed relief, exhaustion and yet accomplishment, all in one moment.I really felt like I SAW them in that moment ... and one way or another, Id like to see them again, something like that.
TopGear Cheer up, when we where kids we would of loved toO of driven a Cannonball car or Smokey and the Bandit car accross the U.S.A. pulling laughs and eating truckie food getting to drive KKnightridder or Airwolf.Or even just driving a junker up the Bonneville salt flats.
TopGear 3 of the oldest school kids on the planet please America keep them over there
TopGear Lovely. Ill take one, please.

TopGear Down vote for profile picture, you clearly know how some people react to spiders and i assume you are intelligent enough to realize that this is not a conscious choice. So on behave of everyone, fuck you so very much.
TopGear The best part is Tom  the umbrella. I have never seen an umbrella do that before in my life. : ) I have seen umbrellas ruined by the wind, but not like that. : ) I can always laugh at the umbrella part. : )

TopGear Already watched the Top Gear Mwahaha the perks of being English )
TopGear I usually dont watch Top Gear but I watched this one. Only the part with Tom. Im not a car fan and the only reason I know of the show is my family watches it. XD It was amusing.
TopGear Did he gain weight his cheeks look kinda chunky, of is it the helmet, either way hes still cute
TopGear kissing the screen atm O
TopGear TOM HIDDLESTON Behind the Scenes On TOP GEAR  Feb 17 BBC AMERICA  YouTube
TopGear He wears glasses and theyre adorable!
TopGear Loki in a reasonable price car!
TopGear They crack up at Hugh in that sweater but dont even break a giggle for Matt in that pic dressed as Liberaces boi? He looked 100x more faggy than Hugh did in that sweater. Ill mannered, liberal idiots.
TopGear Theyre all drunk out of their minds, but that makes this show so good.
TopGear You can tell theyre all good friends in real life!
TopGear Those three are bril. Hugh especially I didnt know he could be funny.
TopGear Bill Murray is fucking riot! lol
TopGear I dont think I have ever seen Bill Murray laugh that much
TopGear Lippy? What does that mean in America?  I dont know... ! LMAO haha xD
TopGear bill murray is absolutely sloshed
TopGear Did he just say Mark Wahlberg at the end??????
TopGear Hugh is such a poshO but a good sport. Brilliant
TopGear Why does Bill say Mark Wahlberg at the end?
TopGear Ah, this was so much fun!
TopGear Only Americans go on a British show and laugh their arses off at a Brit using his own Britishisms.Murica.Lol!
TopGear at did end did Norton say Mark Walhberg, ladies and gentlemen?
TopGear I just love Bill Murrays uncontrollable laughing  that alone would have set me off even if I didnt know what the joke was.
TopGear mark wahlberg, ladies and gentlemen
TopGear Matt Damon the best chat show ever True..
TopGear Hilarious, but poor Hugh! I actually think hes quite dashing in his woolly jumper!
TopGear Its a joke right?. Its matt damon not mark wahlberg?
TopGear Cant remember when I laughed so much. Matt Damon and Bill Murray were just superb as was Hugh B. Its such a lovely show  yes, Graham can be bitchy, but you just know hes a great chap and really brings out the best in his guests. I loved it at the end of the actual show when Matt Damon said that he had never had more fun on a talk show  and he meant it. Bravo Graham!
TopGear Was there water in the glass?
TopGear I want a favourtie wooly jumper :D.
TopGear he looks like mrs doubtfire.

TopGear omg this gave me stitches from laughter
TopGear Kdo by nechtl mt svj oblben wooly jumper
ZONEofTECH Oh..I didnt know that. I mean...I know that partners have custom thumbnails (which I do not have at the moment for some reason). BUT I do have a Store option, which is kinda weird, because I thought only full partners have a store option. Anyway, how can I become a Full partner? thx :D
ZONEofTECH Im sorry to say, youre not fully partnered, you areonly branded, which means you have some of the same options as a full partner, but you can not get banners on your view page, or on your youtube channel, you can not create a show and you can not make any money of it. Have you even signed anything with anyone? And btw, its not illegal to say what youre earning, nobody just talks about it, I gues.. Anyway, have a good day :)
ZONEofTECH normally only full partners get thumbnails and store and those things, but Im also not a full partner but I have custom thumbnails and store, I dont know why but Its awesome. One way you can become a full partner is signing with full screen network, but youll need around 500 active subscribers, and 70,000 video views, so I think you just need to work on subscribers and then contact them :)
ZONEofTECH Yeah, I figured out that I wasnt a fully partner a couple of days ago. It seems that I need more subscribers to become a full partner. And yes, I agreed with Googles terms and conditions which forbade me to say what my earnings are. :)
ZONEofTECH can you put my name on this?
TopGear Want great audio when filming cars? Hear our results with the VideoMic Pro  VideoMic GO that we took to the Top Gear Festival in Sydney.

GameSack what an idiot, 131 divided by 1!!!!!!!
GameSack I have it on good authority she is pursuing an offer to do a full spread in Penthouse. Naturally this didnt sit well with LoL execs so away she goes.
GameSack LATER. Im sad that shes leaving (
GameSack later was the last word
GameSack Be sure to watch to the end of the video, and comment the last word you hear to be entered in a contest for 1,000RP giveaway!
GameSack haha i heard later, but i was like this must be a trick so i, in all my retarded glory, listened to the end of this video about 7 or 8 times, thinking there was some hidden word in the background noise...
GameSack CHACHACHACHACHACHA...CHAAAAAAAAACHAHCHACHACHA. Thats what i heard....can i win the RP? :(
GameSack 1131, had to bust out the calculator for that one i see
GameSack Thanks, for the question I just added it to the description :D

GameSack What was that... 113 devided by 1? Lets see what the calculator has to say about that :D
GameSack Do you....seriously divided 113 by 1 on the calculator?
GameSack 113 divided by 1  113? Holy fuck, math.

GameSack Well, false tags are truly painful when no hot chics appear. But Check out my videos with real league content and no false ID tags. Cheers!
GameSack Wheelchair is in the tags
GameSack hot girl hot chick stripping on cam Nice tags xD
GameSack music was surprisingly fitting
GameSack its actually brilliant strategic marketting, all relevant to getting more views through the search bar.
GameSack i give him props. it probably took at good half hour to think of those and type them all out.
GameSack Wanna play a game?  1 sec LOL.
GameSack MRN rapes I happen to go to school with one of their members.
GameSack Malphite ult actually knocks people up and disables them, Zac is just jumping around doing small amounts of damage.
GameSack why dislikes? this is awesome
GameSack Zac knocks people up and disables them. Then he ults and does it again, and keeps them slowed for a good three seconds. Then he qs and keeps them slowed for a few more seconds. At this point his E is probably coming off CD.
GameSack Although doing that is against the Youtube Terms of Use.
GameSack Wow, dude.. I gotta disagree. I thought he had no dmg and was meh, then i played some games with him... his ganks are SO fkin good. like, one of the best in the whole game, and his teamfighting power is SO OP His ult is just too fuckin good in teamfights.. you can just wombo combo a team easily. Plus you do a lot of dmg even without offensive items, so...
GameSack I honestly think mrn has a lot of potential, just that theyre kind of a new team and people get replaced so sometimes bad plays are made :
GameSack Using a trollface as an avatar is not against the Youtube Terms of Use last time I checked.
GameSack Renekton baits too strong
GameSack Dude why didnt u mention Valor in your tags ??

GameSack He forgot Lyssandra XD
GameSack zed khazix khazix Yes, but what about KhaZix?

GameSack Ziggs has carried this tf imo.

GameSack Kann es noch einfacher gehen einen Penta einen Penta zu machen(trotzdem like)
GameSack whats the name of the song?
GameSack Ingame footage would be really good, especially when discussing the skills. That way we can see visual demonstrations of what youre talking about.
GameSack i watched this when i was really shit with renek and used this build, IT SUCKED HARD, i made my own build practised in tonnes of bot games then was persuaded into a pvp match, i did ok, so i kept at pvp, now im brilliant with the guy and hes my main :D long story short this vid is pretty useless
GameSack By the way there really is no perfect guide for any champ, really you have to analyze the enemy team and counterbuild with your items.
GameSack Songs are: Marilyn Manson  Tainted Love Slipknot  Vermilion pt. 2
GameSack lmfao, cant believe this has so much views, the build is horrible in a lot of aspects
GameSack Berzerkers suck on renekton, he isnt rightclicker.
GameSack lol is it really that hard to make an HD video?
GameSack Omg i suck donkey nipple cock balls, Wow is so much better.. HATERS! COME AT ME!!!!!!
GameSack my build is boots of cooldown dorians blade frozen mallet sunfire cape madredz bloodrazor bloodtrisher and last wisper im selling at finish the dorians blade (: and skills im use first ruthless predator and before slice and dice and before cull the meek and before again x2 ruthless predator (: thx im started with 22 atack i know renek is armor penetration but im love the full power sonick aris add me (:
GameSack This guide isnt really all that indepth, its just an item build with explanations. Theres also a really rather large difference between Renekton and Nasus ultimates in that Nasus ultimate gives him a good percentage of the damage he deals as bonus AD for the duration of the ultimate. Thus is it not unheard of to see Nasus with 1700 AD. This makes Renekton a lot less dangerous in comparison.
GameSack i go dorian shield. CD shoes, than sunfire cape or brutalizer depending ow how much they stck armor. if too much mgc i go Taht armor with more regen cdr, ofc i go max armor pen runes, defens masteries 921, haven quite figure out 2 last items, sicnce this is sick build usualy ends with resign :) Warmonger obviusly not helping since ulti insta heal, revive armor is good vs like khrtus (with zenoia and other with this armor) all rest is dead on actualy def build (or you can escape).
GameSack U gonna do a dr.MUNDO
GameSack are u swedish cuz thats a swedish hamburger resturant
GameSack really useful in my opinion to max e first cuz the cool down takes less time and if you need to escape you can dice through something FLASH and then dice again. Ghost is good and all but only to a certain extent. frozen heart on him is really a maybe, if your team is wrecking shit then yea get it lol. otherwise very nice guides id say. really depends on how you want to build renekton. oh and by the way building him like a carry, doesnt fucking work. build hp resist and cd.
GameSack After all thats done then buy some elixers and there ya go lol. Oh and early on I think you should get oracles before building your quick silver sash if the enemy team has a lot of stealth. believe it or not this actually worked pretty well for me. we were pushed into our base turrets and i had to carry the morons doing this build....good thing they had akali vayne and lux. 3 easy kills lol. One last thing id like to mention is the skilling order. I think it should be e before w, its just.
GameSack at the runes is it Cool down or cool down per level?
GameSack hottible music.... and a baaaaaaad build
GameSack Why do you chose to upgrade Ruthless before Slice N Dice?
GameSack Nice builds and all, but I think you should first try dorans blade merc treadsbrutalizer spirit visage atmas impaler yomumus ghost blade quick silver sash and warmongs. note that this wont work for every team, and if they have a lot of squishies on their team, then you should get last whisper instead of atmas impaler, or if they have a jax, instead of yomumus get sword of the divine just in case. usually youll want to trade spirit visage for frozen heart later on for more cd and armor.
GameSack so this is why its true dmg now...
GameSack now thats a big Cockroach (ChoGath)
GameSack Lol, i guess you did not play LoL back in 2010...
GameSack it sounds so with the programm he uses to speak with friends
GameSack you guys are talking about  10 mins into watch?vzlhMvbUwQfeaturerelated right?
GameSack Well, but I thought one Warmogs gives you 1000 health so 3000health in extra plus generation. Shouldnt be like in this vid 50000 health for Heimerdinger? o.O
GameSack it does and always has done true dmg so ur armor is useless...
GameSack better do this on yi meditate :D
GameSack Hey! u know that this was back in the old days, and if i think back the pool turrent didnt do true damage on that time. but now it does so thornmails did help back then.
GameSack spam? is you a retatrd?
GameSack Note: This video was made in 2010 maybe it reduced dmg genius ...
GameSack someone was playing pong in background :D
GameSack thank you too bro!! )
GameSack LOL kill the shopkeeper
GameSack waaay back in the day Heimers grenade damaged turrets
GameSack dominion is ad though :)
GameSack When I stopped its because of what I said, but also the hidden reason that I couldnt figure out how to fix the rest of it in a relatively easy way... So I took the lazy way out.
GameSack you COULD kill the pool turret, i remember a while ago the pool turret had a HP bar...
GameSack BEEP ........................... BUUP
GameSack And then there was Veigar.
GameSack Mother of god, What a fountain dive.... HOLY SHIT?! I bet thats not possible anymore
GameSack The Sion in the video didnt use heal, it was his ult which gives him 100 lifesteal.
GameSack lol who would dislike this?
GameSack New bronze V players cant remember :D
GameSack Its Ventrillo stupid version of skype xD
GameSack Is your freind a duck? all I hear is QUACK, QUACK
GameSack This comment made me literally laugh out loud
GameSack it does true damage now i think
GameSack beep, blurp. beep, blurp. beep, blurp. Its the sound of you not having friends to play LoL with.
GameSack Too bad it doesnt work like that anymore, laser turret does true damage or something now.... op
GameSack see this is before turrets do 1000 true damage..........
GameSack thats prob the dumbest ive read in a long long time....
GameSack Thanks for saying that. I couldnt read it :S
GameSack no but it seems like you are because u cant spell retard
GameSack I played in 2012, but i didnt know that LoL was from 2010... damn.
GameSack it does true damage now i think
GameSack BTW, you can turn off Key Clicks at the setup in ventrilo!
GameSack Too bad it doesnt work like that anymore, laser turret does true damage or something now.... op
GameSack see this is before turrets do 1000 true damage..........
GameSack Get Back in my Kitchen!
GameSack thats prob the dumbest ive read in a long long time....
GameSack Thanks for saying that. I couldnt read it :S
GameSack Almost as fake as ur moms boob job. But hey... whose complaining?
GameSack no but it seems like you are because u cant spell retard
GameSack I played in 2012, but i didnt know that LoL was from 2010... damn.
GameSack Loser 1.there are no cheats for LoL 2.Sion can do that shit with 4 bloodthirster and 2 phantom dancers
GameSack i can only understand the first 2 words
GameSack This gives a new definition to the phrase Tanks dont die.
GameSack you people dont know how to search for videos eh? lol
GameSack Ventrilo is not worse than skype. Ventrilo chat is hosted on a foreign server, which makes it a lot easier on your Internet than Skype.
GameSack This is possibly the greatest YouTube insult Ive ever seen. You deserve an award made of cookies.
GameSack wish it would be back would make things much easyer
GameSack Did you see the trollface at 3:16?
GameSack i like how its cooming blood out of the inhibitor when you hit it
GameSack the pool turrets on dominion do physical damage which is very odd
GameSack I guess Jimmy is the hater here...on his own video...
GameSack I have seen a video with a glitch where poppy was pushing baron nashor to the fountain, he attacked it xD
GameSack who buys boots???? boots are for pussies!!! lolololololololololololololololololol
GameSack I see someone likes Ventrilo.
GameSack wtf did i just watch? : never mind. I think i have to hurry, theres important work to get back to
GameSack Pro tip: Warmogs gives hp5
GameSack What is that in 2:52 ??? heimer putted something next turret O.o
GameSack lol U idiots dont know u cant hit pool till u break all other or all the mid turret with the nexus ones
GameSack i heard it breaks through hourglass, trynds ulti and kayles ulti
GameSack My thoughts exactly. Those good old days.
GameSack at 2:33 that Alistar walked through the inhibitor :D
GameSack Thornmail. Its made with Cloth armor and Chain armor.
GameSack on the 2013 on march. u cant attack or click on the pool turret. its deal 1000 true damage per hit, ignores all armour and magic resistance, tyrn ulti and all the other champions abilties and spells.
GameSack This is real but a long time ago when the obelisk deals physical damage.
GameSack Year ago everyone could it did like 100 dmg now it does 1000 true dmg
GameSack I would be scared shitless if a Cho Gath was spawning killing my entire team.
GameSack Its now, but it used to be xxx amount of PHYSICAL damage.
GameSack Beep boop fuck the turret :D
GameSack You know, three archangels, zhonyas ring, lich bane and rylais scepter would be so much better to put on veigar? I had 1200 AP and that was rape.
GameSack HHahahaha well... tell me if you have reached 1025 ability with veigar! i am still n1 in our team!
GameSack its not that much. i was Kennen once. i had 1200 xD
GameSack Pro way to win is play pantheon or TF so you can ult into base and BD the shit outa the enimies during a team fight when you have 2 tanks and support champs just slowly taking and healing any damage. Its fun to BD on noobs. Won a game by pushing a tower, inhib, and last 2 towers all in a minute on Sivir, cleared all their enimies super easily p
GameSack my record: 1400 AP with veigar )
GameSack imo u really shudve killd the pantheon and not let the tower die, but eh lol
GameSack tunamifreakje k i l give it a try i think i ll add voidstaff )
GameSack It was called Zonyas ring, fuckface.
GameSack moneybagz131lol Karthus had over 1000 in one game. Fricken destroyed my face every time he used his ult or AoE.
GameSack Amazing how good players fail using hotkeys. And wow, listening to your voice one gets the feeling you are dead  no emotions whatsoever.
GameSack moneybagz131lol by level 18 on veigar you should have 1k.... deathcap, deathfire grasp, archangels  1100ap
GameSack TheDarknessOfVoid Push to talk...
GameSack DragOzze i got there before LOL. well if the games go on long, get full stack mejai Soul Stealer, and yeah i got to like 900 when iuse elixer of brilliance it wentup to 1k AP XD
GameSack 2:45 in chat (enemy) WOOHOO I WIN lol
GameSack Opteryx ecstatic over a video game isnt a common trait for normal people im afraid
GameSack Yeah, stack Archangels(for straight mana since its unique) and grab a Zhonyasduring an hour long game, you can easily get 1400AP. Personally, Ive made it to 1420 or so in a 65 minute game.
GameSack Artanis186 Sounds about right you would usually get that much after getting zhonyas and a few other items. But Ive had 1016 ap before it was extremely funny watching people run
GameSack lol? i roffledd in this video. atlesat it was 6 month ago ryt? x)
GameSack are you guys talking on a fucking walkie talkie?????
GameSack ewol192 ty let me write that down so i can sticky note it on my pc.
GameSack afk pant or just suicidle for tower
GameSack i watched half the video, and all i saw was a noob that somehow got 20 stacks then tried to make a video and ended up losing almost all his stacks, and playing really bad, had to close the video to not suffer anymore.
GameSack gawd Ezreal still healed back then . he got hella nerfed since then.
GameSack A little extra penetration didnt hurt anybody... hehe
GameSack Colin4316 um maybe because its seriously almost impossible to be bad with him since unless you are a complete retard no matter what he will have a lot of ap. They should take the ap gain out of his skill and only get the ap from kills I would say thats fair .
GameSack just did first real game as veigar i only had time for like 100 ap and went 5 0 7... we kept raping them in team fights early on lol
GameSack mani2putz0sf09 haha yeah it does. it was 6 months ago (april) however, i was just happy to belong to a clan in my noob stage of LoL development.
GameSack If you used it, you would have lived btw at 1:30 maybe? (terribad grammar right there. RELEASE THE GRAMMAR NAZIS)
GameSack Jimmy593 ok well it was a question and I didnt play beta, so saying it didnt exist would have been good enough you fucking douche.
GameSack not really a fed veigar, especially with 3400 AP, but still goes to show he can rape with 2 items
GameSack yes it did you fucking noob. Ive played for 2 years and rabadons has always been available
GameSack should i buy veigar? i like far ranged champion that r op mordekaiser is a favorite but he doesnt do tht well far ranged just his R and his E
GameSack ...time. He can lower tons of hp fast but if u learn to focus ull survive a lot longer
GameSack Jimmy593 veigar is still really good... amazing counter pick to ap stacking teams
GameSack BTW how did u get feed, they are playing 5 times better than your team :p
GameSack dont talk like a retard man
GameSack except of pantheon everyone was a tank ...
GameSack youre not a very good veigar at all...
GameSack did you mid in this game? were u carry?
GameSack joemcintyre94 If you infact get more than one archangels yes. You only mentioned one. I know how to play veigar.
GameSack dude that was the BEST i love how u 2 shottd annie and panth :D and completel OWND there garen rite in the end
GameSack i was playing with a veigar with 1.1k ap ownage oo
GameSack j0hnnyguy Veigar gets 5 extra ap when killing champion with any source of damage, even with auto attack, if Q is maxed.
GameSack lol this cunt a scrub
GameSack veigars pro i use him right now and barely loose any games
GameSack hristo7777 It only takes 1 noob feeder...
GameSack LoLwanker anyone with good items  Fed. thus the title of this video. it is not titled Pr0 Ve1g4r z0mg hax. take your shitty comments elsewhere
GameSack rimiko86 agreed. that is the ONLY pro rotation
GameSack Jimmy593 He still is i went 19212 with him
GameSack paladiii They did nerf it a while ago, you can only use the skill Q to last hit minions and get 1 ap a kill. You only get AP per kill if you kill Champions, its not ANY unit.
GameSack cheecheepong dude the ap ca is 30
GameSack lol, i was like fuck, the meteor is taking forever to fall. I forgot this was before they patched it. At this time you needed at least lvl 4 stun to keep them there long enough to meteor
GameSack rimiko86 Did he say hes pro..?
GameSack rimiko86 Actually its W before Q so the prep time has time to hit. Learn to play.
GameSack jongreenepwns q will at least add more ability power per champion kill
GameSack lol all says no ZRIng lol tards no need
GameSack Ive played against veig who had 1k ap !
GameSack heh this was uploaded in april. looking back i see how noob i was  hey, we all thought veigar was good at one point right?
GameSack LoLwanker Are his items really THAT good? An archangel, boots, and a soulstealer. He just has them a bit early.
GameSack I have to say, you suck! Standing there, clicked 3 things and then died with a horrible nooo fucking retard. Just went out clicked 3 things and died, scrub..
GameSack Jimmy593 he IS good...
GameSack why u no use rabadons ()
GameSack rimiko86 lemme see your match history scrub
GameSack omfg this pantheon trying to backdoor scene shows how crappy u are. why not hit with cage? O not that hard? no you let him kill ur turret... great play :D NOT
GameSack Jimmy593 oh... hes not..? fuck man I just bought this guy perm.... :(
GameSack sigiproductions Sorry to hear that.
GameSack To bad you didnt have deathfire :(
GameSack Jimmy593 How about the guys who commit to telling everyone their character is OPeasy to play and theirs is not?
GameSack Legenday ! YEESSSS :D
GameSack LoL gameplay videos always have terrible ratings. Fuck the LoL community.
GameSack klizarid18 I may be a noob but at least im not subbed to RWJ.... hahaha. nice uploads

GameSack Tank team ?  Garen, Shen, Alistar .
GameSack AzianKokazian i agree. its interesting how many greatgoodpro players are around, yet everyone complains that everyone else sucks.... hmmmm.....
GameSack rimiko86 use q after meteor.. to get 5 extra ap for the kill..
GameSack Well fed but not played that good ) nice vid
GameSack i just played against a veigar with 1008 AP!?!?! fcking unbelivable, he had 3 archangel a zhoynas and boots and another ap item ( dont remember) i had 200 magic res and his dark matter hit for 781!... he raped our team..

TopGear hope Automation adds crazy engines like rotary, i5, v16, w16, and maybe motorcycle engines
TopGear Fun car!I recreated this engine in my game and if you want it to be a factory production car, I recommend using the IBeam Steel conrods rather than the Titanium ones. Second I happened to notice it can run on Super Unleaded just fine, allowing it to run on gas you can buy at corner gas stations. Both changes result in no loss in horsepower whatsoever. :)
TopGear 062 mph in 2.5 seconds... Dang
TopGear Id like to see you build something silly for the fun of it. turbo v8 in a mini FF or something. lol try to kill the test driver with as bad of a car that you can make.
TopGear This game keeps getting better ! Please get it on steam ASAP
TopGear If this is wanted this much I Will make it a Special for 3000 subscribers:) Hows that sound?

TopGear Please do a review of entity (koenigsegg ccxr or Agari)
TopGear I love 60s racers, they are crazy and cool looking.
TopGear I love this car but would have rather had the Chaparral Fan car though.
TopGear Ok so we got this, wheres the 2J?
TopGear How many gears does it have
TopGear Its crazy how real forza 5 looks
TopGear Meh I dont particularly like this car pack very much. However the Nissan, and the Xbox One V8 Super Car are pretty nice. I would love to see a car pack with brand new GT cars or F1 cars. Cmon turn 10 only the Lotus F1 car!! You can do better lol.
TopGear Because its automatic in real life.
TopGear tommykaira zz vs lambo gallardo lp570
TopGear Would have been awesome and hilarious of they added the 3 wheeler Robin car from Top Gear :D
TopGear Lots of potential drift cars, Im very enthused! :D
TopGear Its like they want to piss of their fans...
TopGear Make the Car Pack cheaper!!!!!! :D
TopGear FUCK YOU TURN10, BRINGING THE VF NOW WHEN I CANT AFFORD AN XBOX ONE FUCK FUCK FUCK
TopGear Give us back the c9!! Tired of only using the Mazda, why have it where theres only one car thats competitive
TopGear April Car pack still not many new cars most of these are from pervious games
TopGear I hate you Turn 10. You and your braindead fans.
TopGear yeah. Audi rs4 and subaru impreza
TopGear Hey all dlc cars are free no in game credit :)
TopGear It looks great but we really need a drift pack soon. Please bring back the S14 and S13. :D
TopGear Turn 10, why didnt you add these songs from these trailers as soundtracks in the game? Theyre actually pretty good.
TopGear Why so many dislikes? This looks good!
TopGear Turn 10 cant just go out and pick any car they want and put it in the game. They need licences from the car companies to do it and some car companies sometimes dont give them permission to use some of their cars. Turn 10 arent doing it to be lazy. Its licencing issues.
TopGear As long as gamers, racers and true Forza fans are buying anything that MS throw with T10 on market, Forza title will be worst and worst.Simply stop moaning and buying this crap. I understood it somewhere around Horizon and famous forza physics lie. Dont get me wrong, i wish one day Forza would be again worth naming MOTORSPORT, but till then dont buy this 40 of Forza 4 contend in omg 1080 60 fps....Anyway, thanks T10 for pushing me to explore amazing content of pCars, Assetto, GSC, R3E, DTM, Formula Truck, F1 and many others.
TopGear Forza is an amazing game! Like people said, im not hating, but Turn 10 should really start coming out with ALL new cars, maybe 1 or 2 from Forza 4 per pack, but not 10 completely RECYCLED cars from Forza 4. This game is just basically next gen Forza 4 cuz like some guys said, theres only 1 or 2 new cars per pack and the rest are just recycled from Forza 4. T10 really needs to get their game faces on when it comes to DLC cuz this isnt going to be very popular unless NEW DLC is realeased. Not hating, I hope some of you guys agree
TopGear Yet another shitty car pack..but atleast the new Holden v8 is in the game.
TopGear why is it that turn10studio always makes the same dlc packs for forzathis is all most the same dlc pack as in forza horizon and forza 4im not going to download this one if I have a xone
TopGear Pfft.. People these things are remodelled! Brand new models, Id rather have new models than recycled crap... That Holden looks interesting, though. I will definitely be buying this pack.
TopGear Aaaand, the pack has actually been out since yesterday.
TopGear Oh my, Ive never seen these cars in a Forza game before! Good job Turn 10! No! This car pack is a joke and makes Call of Duty Ghosts Spectrum camo look like a good idea.
TopGear Turn10 you just had to add the Commodore didnt you, now im going to have to buy it
TopGear Hey thanks Turn 10! For once again pissing in our faces.
TopGear Where is the Huracan? :( Please turn 10 add some new cars other than 2. I feel bad for the car pass owners
TopGear Glad i bought the vip pass and not the season pass lol these car packs are rough ..
TopGear And what is on it top gear?Only the transit and that holden...
TopGear Come on turn 10, give us some more gt cars. People are really like the gt mini endurance events. The game is crying out for cars like the gallardo gt3, mp412c gt3, bmw z4 etc. Please make it happen.
TopGear Ferrari 458 speciale, Mclaren 650s, PORSCHE(911 turbo,911 gt3, Carrera gt, 918 spyder...) , Alfa Romeo 4c, BMW M4, Mercedes SLS Black, Ferrari California T, Koenigsegg One:1, Lamborghini Huracan, Corvette C7, Corvette Z06 C7, Camaro Z28, Jaguar FType V6 and V8 S, Aston Martin V12 Vantage S, Maserati Ghibli, Zonda R, Ferrari 599xx, FXX and others PLZ!!!!
TopGear Yes! Finally we Priaulx and Ekstroms green hoonwagon.
TopGear umm wernet all these cars included in Forza 4??
TopGear Only season pass holders can get it now i already have downloaded the pack and im in the middle of somewhat impressed and somewhat disappointed i wish you guys added at least a couple of supercars in each car pack
TopGear WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
TopGear Anybody know what the song in the trailer is?
TopGear Hey guys, can you watch some of my videos and leave a feedback, please? I would be glad :)
TopGear Forza 5 is such a disappointment.
TopGear Leave it to Turn 10 to add a new DLC with 1 new car that everyone still has to pay for. Now im glad my game and console got stolen, so i dont have to waste money on F5 dlc
TopGear T10,I understand that you have to remake every car, and that you arent just recycling or copy and pasting them.BUTIf you really do have to remake every car, why not make those cars new to the series? Whats the point of remaking cars that have already been driven by 7080 of people playing this game?Id actually buy DLC if it was new. So would a lot of people. And we all know that youre money whores  you and MS  so you should probably listen to your fans when its about DLC.I know that nothing will changed for the rest of FM5 DLC. All we can realistically do is hope that some sense is knocked into you in future games.
TopGear Worst car pack to date.
TopGear Forza 5 has no salvation, seriously this game is lame, the amount of cars are ok, but the amount of tracks...also no auction house, the new storefront is terrible, this game has everything wrong.Turn 10, if youre doing Forza 6 or Horizon 2, PLEASE! made everything like forza 3 or 4! bring back the auction house, bring back the OLD STOREFRONT system, bring back the car clubs, you just did this game almost to make people to throw real money even after buying this game, youre destroying your name, I can tell you this because I have been following you guys since Forza 1 on the original Xbox.Im a Forza fan and I can see when shit its done, and Forza 5 its shit done. dont listen to the blinded Fanboys. listen to the Fans.If Forza 6 or Horizon 2 are like this game, people will start to leave...
TopGear Oh look, another pack full of cars from FM4.
TopGear At least they gave us 1 V8 supercar Car Of The Future knowing forza though it will probably feel the same as the current in game cars :
TopGear Not sure what these have to do with Top Gear
TopGear Absolutely dreadful. Where is the C7 Corvette? Please, get with the times.
TopGear Racing Holden, Nissan R390, original Elise, Audi RS4... yeah, Im JUST cool with buying this. Still want the Alfa 4C though...
TopGear Turn 10 why do you add the Hummer to almost every Forza? It is slow as Maple Syrup and you guys never make a proper track for the Hummer
TopGear bring the 2000 Jaguar xk8xkr
TopGear When theres an FC rx7, ill buy some dlc
TopGear Another solid pack keep up the good work!
TopGear April car pack lol! I got it today!
TopGear Sorry, but this is boring. TG have so much more interesting cars.
TopGear Really? Like really?? This is im not even going too bother getting Xbox one or Forza 5! Same cars?? Cime on!
TopGear Cant wait for Forza6 and getting the back log of cars from Forza4
TopGear The reason F5 has less cars? It was rushed for a launch title. Thats it. The car packs are bringing back some of the old favorites with new cars. If MS hadnt rushed F5 as a launch title, T10 probably would have had more time to model cars.
TopGear Idea: add some cars most people actually want Ill name a few C7 stingray, Ftype14 M4M3, Lamborghini veneno, Porsche 918 spyder, Porsche 911(any),etc. now dont even get me started on tracks. Just please for lack of a better way of explain it be more like GT6
TopGear Again cars that only should of been there in the beginning. Iracing is better a lot less cares but more excitement and real simulation
TopGear Come on so basically 1 new car again
TopGear SHOULD HAVE MADE FORZA 5 FOR XBOX 360!!!
TopGear Lmfao at T10, what a joke.
TopGear If it supposed to be released on April 1st, how come I got the pack last night?
TopGear Different month, same crap... Way to go T10
TopGear Monthly Track Packs would have convinced me to keep playing Forza. Ill wait to see how Horizon 2 is and FM6. Hopefully both of those keep me engaged for more than 5 hours.
TopGear Hover van Time to show wincup whoes boss
TopGear This game is garbage compared to Forza 4
TopGear No C7 corvette.....dropping the ball turn 10.
TopGear Call of Duty has more original DLC than Forza Motorsport 5. Dammit Turn10 get it together. Whose grand idea was it to bring the H1 Alpha back? Like seriously?..... Thats just giving people a massive roadblock for drifting lobbies. This DLC should be free.
TopGear It says available april 1st i got it yesterday, (March 28th). I am not sure if this is a glitch or not.
TopGear Wow this pack is kinda gay add something nice like 79 skyline ke70 s14 Honda integra and re add rims like work equip 03
TopGear For the people saying these cars are remodeled please stop repeating that lie. The technology when they first scanned the cars in forza 4 probably have more polys than the cars in Forza 5 have. They just tone down the poly count to where the hardware and render engine would work great. The license issue may be one of the factors holding some cars back. They are doing this dlc because they have been working in the actual new cars and will start releasing them when the season pass ends just watch
TopGear A.CarmineB.CarmineC.CarmineD.CarmineNotice How It Goes A,B,C Order
TopGear As much as I really want that Chaparral, I absolutely refuse to support this DLC system! Ill probably pick this up when it inevitably goes on sale. If this is the future of Forza, I think I need to start looking for a new racing franchise. I understand that this is a launch title, but its lost the passion that made previous Forzas so enjoyable.
TopGear Ford Transit SSV? Shut up and take my money!
TopGear clubs next update right?
TopGear Could you please also remodel the drivers needed for using Fanatec Wheels? I mean, if this is about bringing all the stuff we liked about FM4, you might as well let us use the wheels. Otherwise you still wont be getting my money.
TopGear Just my personal list of cars I hope to see Turn10Studios : C7 Stingray, Jaguar FType, Ayrton Sennas McLaren MP44, any Porsche, 2015 Z28 Camaro, MB SLS AMG Black Series, some of the Tudor USCC racecars, Shumachers Ferrari F2002, 91 MB 500E, 55 Chrysler 300, 57 Jaguar DType, Lotus25, and the Williams FW14,
TopGear Hummer ?? WHYYYY ????? Dont you understand T10 that it is completely useless in a ForzaMOTORSPORT ? Once again another DLC full of Fm4 cars
TopGear Was leaked in forums few days ago :p
TopGear Hey guys id you look closely they are the same fucking cars from FM4!! Not good T10, shame on you.
TopGear silly me thinking the new cars i suddenly got were actually a free pack.all it was was a season pass pack that came early for some reason. this so called big suprise early april better make up for it.
TopGear oh look more cars you have to pay for that you got free in forza 4
TopGear Wheres the rest of COTF V8SC..??
TopGear Uhhh I doubt top gear would have selected the hummer. Maybe as a joke car.
TopGear I thought this was Top Gear Pack?! Wheres my Hammerhead iEagle Thrust.
TopGear We dont want a lame XBone logo
TopGear Forza and Turn 10 please consider adding the Australian Manufactured ford falcon (factory model), you have the Holden (HSV 427), why not Ford?
TopGear Available April the 1st? I already have these cars and can use them? eh?
TopGear renault 5 turbo, wheelies incoming?
TopGear Get ready for the fanboy vs. troll war...
TopGear Still waiting for the new Corvette C7 Stingray which GT5 had that over a year ago. Or just give us another track to play on (Suzuka, Road Atlanta, Nuhrburgring). If not, then give us some of the fictional tracks from Forza4 like Camino Viejo or Sunset Peninsula.
TopGear Best racing game on the planet.And just look at dem graphics. Beautiful
TopGear Its funny, because I won one of the wheels from the xb1 v8 supercar

TopGear Dont understand how this is a top gear pack...having seen every episode.
TopGear I cant tell weather this is an April folks joke or not.
TopGear xone is killin it. i dont need anymore games until watchdogs.
TopGear These should have been in the original release.
TopGear Pls give us the top gear time track!!
TopGear man....i think im just gonna wiat for the next, more finished and riefined version of this game, the game that should have been the first forza title for xbox one....forza 6........i really do love what they did with the game but man the lack of content is such a huge bummer every time i play it. the amount of cars we have now should have been in the game already, and there should be more tracks. i know its not turn 10 fault. microsoft pushed them to realese it for day 1
TopGear we want more tracks, specially rally tracks. why you put rally cars and force it to drive on circuits?
TopGear 10 cars built for the next generation!...9 of which were in Forza 4... and 5 of which were in Forza 3...
TopGear Why is there no geoff
TopGear I dont think its a problem we see most of the past cars, because some of these cars are great and a lot of people like them. What I think is really stupid, is that they now have openwheel and they dont even utilize it... theres barely any open wheels in this game.
TopGear the only thing is.... no P45 or GEOFF on it
TopGear Turn 10! I want Russian cars! Like VAZ, GAZ etc!
TopGear Even though weve already had the majority of these cars previously, for the first time its a good group of cars
TopGear I love the shot of the hummer
TopGear They need to add the chrysler pt cruiser and the range rover sport
TopGear They should put Richard Hammonds GT3 in the pack lol
TopGear So pedestrian. A real Top Gear car pack would have such vehicles as the Alfaab or Geoff.
TopGear Sencit Music (Tenth Dimension 4)  No Questions Asked
TopGear Ummm WTF no Alphas? At least a Reliant Robin or a Tacoma?
TopGear BEST RACING GAME IN THE WORLD!!!!
TopGear what is that song?????
TopGear Where is the hover van.

TopGear HOW ABOUT THE GOD DAMNED NURBRGRING !!!!!!!!
TopGear Am I the only one that can buy them now?
TopGear This is good bad on timing almost six months later couldve been sooner ( just because i love this game)
TopGear graphics can NEVER get better than this.
TopGear Aint played forza since last year lol
TopGear any car that was free in forza motorsports 4 should also be in forza motorsports 5.... complete bull. Take out a bunch of cars that were in the previous game and release them again as dlc car packs...
TopGear Meeh... All my cars are better than that but that van, oh that van would be sick to drive
TopGear Check out the new cars the will be coming to Forza Motorsport 5 on April 1st. This pack includes the 2013 Audi RS4 Avant, 2008 Subaru Impreza WRX STi, 1999 Lotus Elise Sport, 1980 Renault 5 Turbo, 2011 Ford Transit SuperSportVan, 2013 Lexus GS350 F Sport, 1998 Nissan R390, 2006 Hummer H1 Alpha, 1966 Chaparral 2E, and More.

TopGear Just found this video... wanted to say thank you for the publicity on my IROCZ paint job. I was wondering why that particular paint was getting so many more likes and downloads compared to my other Yenko fantasy paints. Now I know. Thanks again for downloading it and unknowingly advertising it for me.
TopGear I really think that your friends are kind of annoying Sounding like i u think so to
TopGear wtf. the syclone is awd. damn mexicans
TopGear Add me gt: mexican visitors

TopGear just a hint with drag racing you need as much grip (rear wheels) and torque as possible
TopGear CivicIntegra circuit challenge!
TopGear Sorry for being a dick but you shouldnt of have laughed a full RPM becuase it makes the starting torqe a birch lol
TopGear Can u play gta 5 with Big Dx10
TopGear Whats with the audio? U answer their questions before theyre done saying them
TopGear All about the fucken tune
TopGear Why do you hold down your accelerator when changing gears
TopGear and also you can get the gmc cyclone way way way faster
TopGear It wasnt 4 wheel drive I swear
TopGear 100k is too much for top gear so dont put top gear in the title
TopGear now I want a gmc cyclone now
TopGear Great video... Always loved your videos and always will!

TopGear So..is the Syclone not awd in fm4?
TopGear Nick just next time before you drive it remember to check if the last victims clothes are in the back
TopGear i want them to put in authentic drag cars
TopGear Tune it so you dont get wheelspin and you will do better
TopGear it could be faster in real life in a 14 mile can do 7 sec. so you can make it faster
TopGear I got to test drive a Bugatti veyron :d
TopGear Why didnt you do a classic Camaro?
TopGear I have a buggatti drag car and it sometimes does wheelies because it has 1.5k horse power and only weighs 3000 pounds
TopGear Solid track. Never played the game so it certainly doesnt hold as much meaning to me as it would if I did but hey, still a solid track nonetheless.
TopGear Reminds me of the KKND 2 soundtrack :)
TopGear Same as LucJenson. Dont care about racing games, but damn fine music.
TopGear Great track. Reminds me of the old time demo tracks one traded at big LAN parties.
TopGear Good track. Keep rocking Sir NutS
TopGear Notice how his info said playing from Canada. This is because no one knows the provinces if I spelled that right
TopGear some of them you might not have know bcause the where from very earlie ones
TopGear the koeningsegg ccx has really bad handling in nfs hot pursuit.
TopGear Also try out cars in general its pretty fun too :D

TopGear I guess 3:50 was referring to the Vietnam special when theyre trying to pass their scooter tests and the instructor keeps saying Jeremy Clarkson...fail. XD
TopGear Looks like a instance of a Temple Runalike game with no interesting and nocharge twists.
TopGear how can i partake in your online community races, they look like a lot of fun.
TopGear please can we have more gt6 online with you
TopGear You didnt show my car rolling :(
TopGear I can recognize almost all cars.. that isnt a good thing i suppose
TopGear Why dont u just record while playing???
TopGear the classic volvo saloon in the first race was has never been used in a top gear challenge so i don t know where they got that idea from
TopGear My car may have over taken you on the last race if it wasnt damaged :P
TopGear Just sayin, but that car racing against the Aygo in the last race is an AustinHealey.
TopGear I have an idea for a failrace va the community on GT6, similar to the nascars in the rain one. My idea is to have 1000hp rwd cars in the rain at night. I think it would be very chaotic and alot of fun.
TopGear Great video, keep up the great work :)
TopGear HAHAAAA, THE CLOSEST FINISH IS STILL MINEEEEE!!!! :D
TopGear What if you made everybody use hellaflushed vehicles I feel that would be a fun thing to watch
TopGear I always wished I had a Porsche 944
TopGear Finaly, you decided to use SAAB 93, looking foward to see how my car is going to be on the track in Forza 4 :)
TopGear my fucking golf was spun whaaaaaaaaaaaa good racing though
TopGear would be awesome if someone could use a maurader
TopGear FailRace I have a vs the community idea do a budget not a high budget like 200k do something like the Ariel atom challenge however their is a flaw as you would never be sure if people actually spent the budget but its an idea that I hope you use in some way
TopGear Old white jag is an XJ120 from the 1940s used in a race between things from the 40s: the car, a bike, and a train
TopGear You should do a gymkhana track
TopGear More dihatsu racing on gt6?

TopGear The cameras on forza r shit
TopGear didnt they use a volvo 240 in like series 3 to jump with the caravans?
TopGear When do you race? and who do i add to race with the FR Community
TopGear Does anyone remember the top gear 100 car challenge??
TopGear Alexander Thompson Its called Failrace. We expect a Lot of fails
TopGear I never knew top gear ever used a mr2.

TopGear Top Gear 20x06 ITA HD Prima Parte
TopGear Do wish the BBC would stop messing about with mobile games and produce a Top Gear game with some merit rather than a shameless cash in. This is Top Gear Race the Stig...
TopGear If youre looking for a great new innovative Android game to review check out Smash Hit, one of the best Android games Ive played and more people need to know about it, cheers!
TopGear Top Gear Race the Stig Android Review well it looks like the Top Gear and The Stig are back with a new free to play game, this time an Endless Runner. Sadly the game is about a year too late for that craze.
TopGear Top Gear race the Stig on Android
TopGear Anyone tried Top Gear Race the Stig?
TopGear This is Top Gear race the Stig, an endless runner that feels a bit like a cash in.
TopGear Looks exactly like Subway Surfers
TopGear Top Gear race the Stig on Android

TopGear How do you get so many credits?

TopGear is the ferrari f12 considered a sedan?
TopGear how it can be Best Sedan Challenge when two cars are coupes
TopGear Why not use a BMW M5, a Lexus ISF and a Benz E63 AMG? That would make more sense right?
TopGear You may want to use manual and clutchYet they have 3 cars with flappy paddle gearboxes xD
TopGear c63 black is not a sedan

TopGear Funny love c63 AMG I own one and its fun setting random car alarms off
TopGear oh yeah no m5 but c63 is better
TopGear And the demolition derby?
TopGear You should do a challenge like that with old muscle cars
TopGear Every Mercedes sounds retarded? I laughed at that. I hope he was joking.
TopGear but nick... the c63 is a sports coupe not a sedan...
TopGear TEEEEEEAM LAAAAAAADSSorry what? Huh? What just happened?

TopGear Im I not in RadicaL anymore
TopGear I played this a lot back in the day and I remember it being the most unremarkable game Ive ever owned. It was the racing game with the hot dog car that was all I could remember, I actually realized that this was the game about two minutes into the review...Oh shit, I just realized I didnt own this, I owned the sequel Top Gear Overdrive.Okay, I guess I dont have memories of Top Gear Rally. Oops.
TopGear I have a memory of get it in my birthday, play, hate it....Funny is when i sold the system i so didnt care about that game that i couldnt find it cart so i sold without it.... yet 1 year after i sold i found it....fast foward 12 years later the cart still in my shelf.
TopGear Never played it, but lit actually looks really fun!
TopGear No, but I have memories of Beetle Adventure Racing! Srsly, you should check it out!
TopGear A new review this time, subscribers! Hope you enjoy!
TopGear I remember not knowing how to unlock stripminetook foreverwhich made me love the game even more
TopGear love your videos, man. thanks for posting them!
TopGear Oddly enough, the graphics are the one thing I remember most about the game. The car reflections were neat.
TopGear I still love N64 snow to this day.
TopGear I use to own this game and the sequels but I did enjoy the original the most.
TopGear I have seen a dude who spent 100 on raw materials via itunes game. I just dont get it
TopGear Thanks man! Now its time to play.
TopGear Do a drag race, has to be rear wheeled stocked muscle car and has to be under 200,000 dollars.
TopGear You chose Spyders. The SLS AMG for example is a Roadster.
TopGear Do a challenge with only Japanese cars. That would be cooool
TopGear fwd Hondas drag do those
TopGear They did make a 599 convertible, its called the SA Aprenta and is extremely rare and expensive
TopGear The NORMAL MP412C it NOT CONVERTIBLE it would need to be the MP412C SPIDER
TopGear In car view too hard for you guys?
TopGear HEY DO DRAG RACE, CHALLENGES AND MAYBE DERBY STYLE GAMEPLAYS
TopGear Hey nick in the future I plan on getting an xbox one and I would like for u to friend me on the list cause it looks like fun
TopGear But the ferrari is still more exciting and better looking.
TopGear Why your video is so bler
TopGear Eating while commentating.
TopGear If you want to watch the latest episodes of top gear, go to streetfire.net
TopGear the fastest car is the mclaren
TopGear if u wanna roll your car, go handbrake it in the corner after the second straight, you get more rolls.
TopGear Do a suv challengetruck challenge
TopGear Can u do a dodge srt4 build it can be any type of build but can you keep the visuals the Same apart from slamming it and removing the rear wing and it can be orange and just max everything out but keep the stock srt4 motor but fully upgrade it and give it black rims but dont increase the size much I dont like them that big and can you also do a range rover jelly car plz that would all be SWAG
TopGear do a race with all Bugattis
TopGear I watched the full video and that was 35 minutes well spent. 1010.
TopGear ferrari won the sound
TopGear The top gear track was designed by Lotus
TopGear Nick at 2:05 you said that there was no 599 convertible but there actually is it was called the GTS SA Aperta and was a limited edition variant of the GTO.
TopGear Its Lexus or Mercedis Benz who has two reverse gears
TopGear In real life the mclaren goes 205 while the Ferrari goes 202
TopGear whats the intro song?

TopGear You should do this on horizon because it has 458 spider and r8 gt spider
TopGear See who can get a hundred mph and break to 0
TopGear AR12Gaming can you please make a rangerover drift tune....funny as hell plz
TopGear ziJustin It doesnt help, it wont revved up fast enough and you just go slower and your RPMs are just lower ,but if you tuned down the gear so it would rev higher where its in the peak in power so that would be a useful gear. As a stock car it is just a gear for better gas mileage.
TopGear For the rolls you should have done less is better as it shows the car is safer at speed
TopGear Plz do more cause there so good plz do more ur awesome
TopGear I run 1:13s in my lightly modified 2004 subaru wrx sti haha

TopGear Whats the difrence between spider and roadster?
TopGear Best cheap drift car stock
TopGear It was a awesome livestream and Im preety stocked that you speak German :D Can you take a look at my paintjobs? My GT is FrancescoPaulke
TopGear The car with 2 reverse gears was the Mercades Benz 7G Tronic
TopGear On Top Gear the Mclaren won but they said not to get it because it didnt have pizaz or something.
TopGear The mclaren sounds like the hover bike from jak and daxter
TopGear The First Mercedes CLS Concept, as shown on Top Gear, had 2 reverse speeds and the 2006 Lamborghini Muira Concept could do 130 MPH in Forza 4
TopGear Part 3 should be with the Vestra planes (new dlc) and then instead of the Bifta, use bicycles.
TopGear this is like subway surfers copy.
TopGear Its just like Subway Surfers
TopGear cant find it on the app on play store give the link please
TopGear Loving these, hope you keep going with these!

TopGear I got an alright challenge idea for you topgear presenters buy test and prove that you can get a good car for 16,000 or less I only ask as im interested to see what you guys pick to help me choose a reasonably priced car thats 16,000 or less cause I cant decide and I think you guys would be able to make an awsome episode from it not that all of em arent awsome :) but yeah just throwing the idea out there
TopGear Heres an idea, get 3 people, meet up at the airport. 2 people get in a plane and the other gets in any car of their choosing. Race to mount chillad but the plane users have to land at sandy shores airfield and take a car to the top of mount chillad. Hope you havefun!

TopGear Learn to shift before you drift!
TopGear Is the volvo 242 in this game
TopGear Obviously when u switch from high powered drift machine to low powered drift machine is hard to drift because they both use different technique,if u watched the drift bible low powered car needs to drift on a high toque band so u can get the wheel spin
TopGear Can I please do it with you?
TopGear When you twerked in the beggining you used alot of tourqe so would it be tourqed?

TopGear Where do I watch the live streams?
TopGear Can you do it in tdu2 and Forza horizion
TopGear I thought it was top gear but all I get to see is a lame ass game
TopGear Hold on, Did I hear you say drifting with 200bhp is hard? Really? Well, I think you need to work on your techniques, using momentum and such, because if an 86 with 200bhp is hard to drift then either you arent running the right difficulty setting or you arent shifting the weight in the car correctly. You should be able to shift the weight with a feint or braking drift in an 86 easily.
TopGear 2:56 I dont care what youd be driving anyone will die.
TopGear xbox record that...xbox record that...xbox record that...xbox record that...xbox record that LOOOOOOOOOL

TopGear ATENO: ESTE VDEO  UMA REPOSTAGEM!
TopGear Gahhou o Inscrito numero 1.005
TopGear se eu podese eu dava 2 likes tipo: DOUBLE LIKE
TopGear I love the original game and find it very enjoyable and have to say I need this s I gotta be honest I totally prefer the street car racing over rallying! Also as you said its a fantastic looking game, off to Ebay I say! lol
TopGear i used to play this round my mates house was fun. My fave ever top gear episode is vietnam
TopGear I have many many fond memories of top gear rally and the paint shop! Great racing series!
TopGear Not the best N64 racer, but it was certainly a fun game, especially with friends.
TopGear I definitely loved the box art of this game, so cool!
TopGear I agree this is an impressive racer on the N64. A must have racer on the N64.
TopGear top gear rally is the best in the series for me top gear overdrive was ok but i much preferred ridge racer 64 but i think il give it another shot if i can find it cheap cool review glenn
TopGear Did you know that Grindstone was made for this game? I would love to have this one, but its too hard to find.
TopGear There are so many good racers on the 64
TopGear they could make money off the name if they decided to make a game for ps4 or the new nintendo
TopGear the thing I hate about this game is the instant explosion when you bump against a wall or something, it feels so riduculous. fun game though, but not a great racinggame
TopGear Great review as always! This one is on my list :) hehe
TopGear wow the graphics look pretty good for a N64 game, I never heard of this one before... are there any hiccups in multiplayer or does it play smoothly?
TopGear Have a great weekend everyone! My first review of a top gear series game...cant believe it took me so long to get around to this one as its one of my favs!
TopGear Can you review roadsters its a cool racing game withy good graphics but no one reviews it with a good review can you?
TopGear I have this one crakin little game and even crazier im currently watching initial d second stage haha
TopGear I did own this as a kid and did love it. The two things I hated was the music and it was too easy to explode and thought it was too easy to fly off everything. I loved the secret cars though and i too wanted it because of the Expansion Pak.
TopGear i love that box art. it would be sweet airbrushed on a n64. I might pick this up ,looks fun. would be better as a combat racer i think.
TopGear Looks smart, another reason why I need to reacquire an N64.
TopGear Top Gear Overdrive totally beats Gran Turismo! (I really hate that game!)Anyways i dont know why but i really like the floaty controls of the Top Gear games ... it kinda gives the games a really unique feeling.
TopGear Here is a link to download the amazing soundtrack of this game (plus some more). Its really hard to find even on the internet https:www.dropbox.comsrp0ghqug7a067unGRiNDSToNe2020GRiNDSToNe.rar
TopGear Wow this channel needs more subs
TopGear I remember the shortcuts in this game were hard to find and I spent hours just finding them the time trial mode then trying to remember when I started the actual race
TopGear The retroware opening is even cooler now!
TopGear This is a game I really didnt get into. I think its coz I was a Ridge Racer fan and cars in this handle so differently I didnt really give it a chance. Ill either have to dig it out from under my bed or download it and try it on an emulator. I think the latter sounds like less agro.
TopGear not one ive played tbh glenn, it looks pretty decent and the sense of speed I can tell is there
TopGear How does TGO stack up with Diddy Kong Racing and Mario Kart 64?
TopGear This game was pretty good for a racing game on the n64 the backrounds of the tracks did look pretty good great review glenn
TopGear yeah.  I think Im gonna pass on this one.  I dont like to brag, but Im really good at racing games.  I can breeze through everything from Burnout to Fzero GX within a few hours.  With the way you built this game up, Id probably finish it in one sitting.
TopGear Top Gear Overdrive still cant quite live up to the legacy of the original, but its the best Top Gear game since then. With gorgeous graphics, excellent track design, fitting original music, fast and frantic races, great multiplayer racing, and a cool cashupgrade system, Top Gear Overdrive stands on its own as one of the N64s best racing experiences. Only the few problems of not enough tracks, lacking features, touchy control, and a difficulty setting thats a little too easy detract from the game. Otherwise, its a great game for both arcade racing fans and for those looking for something more akin to PlayStation racing games. A tremendous first effort by the small group at Snowblind Studios.
TopGear Why making a Gran Turismo like game for the N64 would never be impossible?N64 actually had some racing simulators, like some F1 games. In fact, in the 90s, if you wanted to play a F1 racing game simulator, you would need to buy a N64, because the PS1 just couldnt handle those games. The best ones were on the N64.Theres also World Driver Championship, which is a simulator just like Gran Turismo and, in terms of visuals and technology, is also far superior to any other racing game at the time.
TopGear I think the game was mostly graphically focused on instead of playability. As you can see, the game has stunningly solid frame rates and wonderfully designed graphics and other visual features, however its lacking deeply in design and playability. Its a transcendent above other racers and it clearly is N64s most beautiful racer for its time.
TopGear ROFL!!!!!! Duck Song!
TopGear What did you think of the Partnership Opportunity that I sent you in your YouTube inbox dude?
TopGear Hey! This is an absolute amazing video! Your channel is absolutely amazing!I just started Youtube, and could use some comments and likes, do you mind checking out my channel? Thank you so much bro! I appreciate it, and keep up the excellent work!

GameSack That music Where is the loop button for when I jungle? hahahaha
GameSack alternatively...go to a YouTube converter....although not recommended as well...youd be stealing it... (not saying if LoL  Riot has it for free download that its stealing, but it would be better just to get it from the source rather than from another website)
GameSack as long as we dont have to relive the day the matches kept getting dosed
GameSack 1 user have login problem lol
GameSack Try looking at soundcloud, it should be at leagueoflegends. If its not, maybe Riot will put it up there sometime soon. If not, you could have found it in the location I indicated in the description of this video (this only applies to when the login screen was present though).
GameSack people that are watching football are the same guys as we, its just that we are watching e sport and i cant wait for the season 3 final :D
GameSack Its better than season 3 championship song
GameSack where can i download this song?
GameSack type in youtube to Mp3, you will need to copy and paste the youtube link and then poof
GameSack Whenever I lose a game, whenever I feel disheartened, I listen to this song and go back to kick ass!!!
GameSack racism has no place in our society... grow a pair and start acting more mature instead of like a 11 year old kid
GameSack I love this login screen so much p
GameSack I wasnt that into lol by season 2, first time playing during lulu login but played only 1 game, started around late zyra patch but only played now and then. Then in december I fell in love with LoL and I started watching every gambitEG lcs game, I aint gonna miss season 3 :)
GameSack Man this brings up memories, there was sooo much hype around this. S3 championship is gonna be awesome too if riot uses this kind of music, builds up so much hype.
GameSack i miss the s2 tpa vs af  Clg eu vs WE
GameSack Well this wont be spoiler since you should be playing this game for 9 months. Everything is awesome about game except players.
GameSack Dude i raised my Division with playing to this song
GameSack Nice loop. Probably one of the best LoL login screen songs yet.
GameSack Smooth transition into loops :D Will be using this for my draft mode champion selection untill I get sick of it, if thats possible :D

GameSack More like meets tron.
TopGear Add a message to your video
TopGear ,   .    .           !
TopGear What the fuck is this ?
GameSack What happens to this channel I cant find it anywhere
GameSack the other guy is so fucking annoying
GameSack It was not a giveaway. Everyone who subscribed to the RiotGames Youtube channel or has already subscribed to it, received this skin! And you could just unsubscribe again after you got the skin, no problem at all. If you dont like this YT channel, you dont have to be subscribed, you can still get the skin!!!
GameSack They still havent been banned, and I got my free unchained alistar skin.
GameSack Lmfaoooooo at the end
GameSack Will. The music is fine and low enough. Dont listen to the haters. If you lower it any more, you wont be able to hear it.
GameSack I love it when Steve goes crazy!
GameSack Great ep.! You two are really funny together!
GameSack last 30 seconds of video were freaking hilarious
GameSack Steve is so hilariously crazy at the end xD
GameSack Its a way for RiotGamesInc to make money without taking it from us directly. If people want skins, we buy them and RiotGames gets money, this is just another port to please the people and earn money. Pretty sure Tobuscus has a similar tendency to giveaway. I do enjoy your usual sassyness to large companies though, Will :)
GameSack Dat drunk guinea pig tshirt
GameSack Excellent point, i would like to donate that money for you to get a nose job. You have a jew nose.
GameSack TheWillofDC I think the volume is a pretty good level now
GameSack Riot FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GameSack I see youre wearing a Charlie Shirt :D
GameSack stop bitchin bout the damn giveaways do people really care?
GameSack Will, please ditch the music. Or lower it significantly. Its really distracting.
GameSack the new thumbnails look really unattractive to click on
GameSack jacie87 I feel like the monies made off of the videos are like their royalties for their work on the production and therefore they are entitled to keep those profits. And honestly, some of it is likely going to go back into their future production budgets just like most content creators do, so as I said, I think theyre entitled to keep that money and use part of it toward future projects. :D
GameSack will... if riot chanel disappear... omfg... you will get so many
GameSack The contributors of the project should each be compensated. Why? Because they are investors...and investors should collect from what they invest in..especially when its not possible without them.
GameSack On the topic of Video giveaways i think its kinda silly that Youtube is trying to stop it. A lot of people have stopped watching TV over the years because of sites like Youtube and i think more and more people will continue to do so. However TV still allows giveaways and GameShows and i think if Internet is truly going to replace TV then we need to embrace that type of content as well. I was very disappointed to find out that my channel cant be accepted as a partner because its a gameshow
GameSack How do you have 310k subscribers and 7k views after a week?
GameSack This show is so gayy!!!!!!
GameSack Riot Games just gave away a free skin and champion (which would normally be like 20 dollars all together) to everyone for just subscribing to there already popular YouTube channel. I think its perfectly fine.
GameSack racdude01 TY for spoiling :D
GameSack Is Collective Digital Studio something like Makers Studio?
GameSack TheWillofDC Will, when you get the skin, you have to connect through googleyoutube to confirm and get the skin. Youtube obviously monitors its transactions with other companies and decided its ok and in their best interests.
GameSack that will cunt has fucken long nails, like manicured nail shit, wtf man, how gay does one get
GameSack Kickstarter: theres strict rules about how the extra money can be used... its outlined right in the agreement
GameSack TheWillofDC Basically with the RiotGames Skin giveaway if you are subscribed to the channel you get the skin, im not 100 sure on youtubes policy but i agree with 3diot on this one, it wasnt a giveaway per say, i was subscribed to them prior to the giveaway and when i went through to the page i got the skin too. it wasnt just a way to Game Subscribers it also rewarded previous subscribers. If you could possibly link me to the policy id love to read up on it though.
GameSack Me gusta mucho tu camiseta de arcoiris!
GameSack Julia Nunes (Jaaaaaaa) did the kickstarter thing. In the end, she was really successful with it! :)
GameSack what exactly IS youtubes policy against? cause beauty gurus hold giveaways all the time too.
GameSack JamesBerg86 thx! will do!
GameSack MadProps4U will look into it now.
GameSack Youtube ISNT a government body. What Riot did WASNT ILLEGAL. The way its established is verified by Youtube itself so that you CAN UNDER YOUR OWN FREE WILL, SUBSCRIBE. Youtube ISNT POLITICS, God.
GameSack u guys are wrong about riot lol
GameSack I dont know if you remember Will but at the start of this yearend of last year you predicted that RWJ would pass RyanHiga interms of Subscribers, and you were spot on. And a couple of videos ago you predicted that Freddiew might surpass RWJ. I think you are going to be right once again considering what freddiew is doing atm.
GameSack when I saw a new youtube News I was planning on commenting that Steve should be in it... luckily I dont have to..
GameSack TheWillofDC i didnt notice the music until i read this comment
GameSack FreddieW should just make the movie better with that extra money. Steve, your evil laugh is coming along. Have you chosen your evil villain name?
GameSack Will, about Riot Games 1. A bunch of people were already subscribed to their channel, I know I already was. 2 They werent giving away imaginary giveaways which a bunch of partners already do and 3. They didnt force people to sub to them, simply getting their already fans of the game to sub to their youtube page so they can share the news with them. They did not say like offer Cash for people subbing for a certain sub cap and do a giveaway. They didnt even get more players from it.
GameSack I think what Steve is trying to say is that the FreddieW contributors are not donating to a nonprofit, they are investing in a forprofit. Whenever you invest in a for profit, and it does well, you receive a return on that investment. So what is the return? Videos? That seems a little weak. He could just rent his videos for that matter. Because I could invest in anything from savings to the market and receive anywhere from .0001 to at least 5 in return.
GameSack Julia Nunes (Jaaaaaaa) did the kickstarter thing. In the end, she was really successful with it! :)
GameSack TheWillofDC the thing here is the diference about a big company and ppl in their room making videos and making money, ofc they gonna get more subs there4 more money, and i play the game i enjoy it the new update is fairly ok, and i wanna see more ppl subbed to riot cause if u go there and watch the videos, they talk about the champions on the game and about fan art, updates and stuff, but most important is a normal channel and the content is equal to machinima or ign youtube cant do much
GameSack what exactly IS youtubes policy against? cause beauty gurus hold giveaways all the time too.
GameSack JamesBerg86 thx! will do!
GameSack Lol at the blooper xD
GameSack MadProps4U will look into it now.
GameSack Youtube ISNT a government body. What Riot did WASNT ILLEGAL. The way its established is verified by Youtube itself so that you CAN UNDER YOUR OWN FREE WILL, SUBSCRIBE. Youtube ISNT POLITICS, God.

GameSack TheWillofDC i didnt notice the music until i read this comment
GameSack FreddieW should just make the movie better with that extra money. Steve, your evil laugh is coming along. Have you chosen your evil villain name?
GameSack Doesnt sxephil do a giveaway every monday, wednesday, and friday for subsribers?
GameSack Your production value has increased quite a bit. I would like to suggest you try different micing. Record your sound in a different way.
GameSack You spetl freddie wrong.....
GameSack youtube companies take the independence out of youtube
GameSack LOL, Steve is just crazy
GameSack I love Steve on here. :) Please have him on here all the time Will!
GameSack Will what Steve was trying to say is that Freddie is already making tons of money off his videos alone. So to ask for another 75K, seems to beg the question, what should be done with the money he was already making off youtube videos? Further more, why did Freddie need to raise an extra 75K? Youre telling me he couldnt finance the series out of his own pocket? BS. Freddie is a top youtuber, he could have easily financed with the money hes made off youtube already. So why the extra 75K?
GameSack youtubers are always whoring around for thumbs up, favorite, subs,etc. which is fair since that it their job after all, what riot did was a smart move, since the game is free they got to earn money off other stuff. also i think maybe it got people on youtube which is always a nice thing. i doubt all those subscribers had an account and didnt joined their website before. now grab a random youtuber and see the ending of one video... follow me,like me, feed me,etc.
GameSack Steve is like Wills personal troll XD
GameSack Will there is no Giveaway. Its a free skin no prize it goes through youtube to get the code for the skin. Soo yeah
GameSack What about Phil, he does giveaways every single video.
GameSack wills wearing a smosh, ask charlie tshirt
GameSack steve is super awesome
GameSack Actually RiotGames is awesome. That skin they give away is pretty awesome. If you play the game you would understand
GameSack TheWillofDC Will there are plenty of partners who do giveaways everyday of the week, I know Phillip DeFranco does it on his show everyday. I do not know who has gotten banned for doing this, Im sure you are more knowledgeable about the situations than myself. Riot games didnt actually gain or lose anything. If you look at it like this, Riot games could have easily just had 100k people join youtube that wasnt already there and all and all isnt it about the community?
GameSack For the popularity of this show, you think it would picked up in production value by now.
GameSack Y U NO talk about theneedledrop winning On The Rise? It was such a close competition!
GameSack TheWillofDC Thats right. No virtual crap. I want a real one.
GameSack ReallyRick I know who he is and that he used to live in New York with Ray a few years ago. Still doesnt explain the fact that 300k people are just clicking the x on their sub boxes. Just unsubscribe.
GameSack s5w6 Its different. Riotgames have the power to advertise on basically ANY gaming site, where millions of people can see them. And within those advertisements, they can promote the subscription to their Youtube channel to gain this free Alistar Skin. Phillip Defranco and Toby do not have that capability, and their giveaways is purely by chance, not a guarantee, and the only way for you to know about the giveaway, is to actually watch their stuff.
GameSack I see no problem with it. 1. It is not a giveaway there is no chance to win they get it. More of an incentive. 2. It is a free to play game. They sold that skin for real money before now it is free. 3. If that is the case then SXEPhil should be banned for doing give aways also. His monday videos get more viewslikesfavorites than the rest of the week because he does give aways. Which is a chance to win Riot Games is a guaranteed item.
GameSack 10.001 view GODDAMN NOOO SO CLOSE RAAAAAAAAAAAA
GameSack TheWillofDC Im surprised you didnt cover all the ish going down in the musician community the last couple weeks. A a lot of musicians with Fullscreen lost their partner status. Megan Nicole, Jason Chen and lot of other musicians. Those guys had ads on their covers which you usually dont see. So do you know what happen?
GameSack MadProps4U will look into it now.
GameSack I love the way he has made a lovely intro and spent time and effort to make a wonderful set and then chosen to film it all from an angle that shows off the wires and folded up curtain in the corner. A few more back boards wouldnt go a miss there Will, maybe a little fillerpaint to get rid of that distracting line in the middle of the set. :)
GameSack Is Jenna Marbles that good?
GameSack TheWillofDC, I have good news for RiotgameINC as well, as of this morning they won Best Free to play Online game On the Golden Joystick Awards. Also I will be making a post with a link on the Riot forums to this video (I apologize if some homophobic pricks show up however)
GameSack what about fpsrussia and epicmealtime?
GameSack jennamarbles is awesome !
GameSack greetings from israel!
GameSack sprbadguy I know YOU are.
GameSack Maybe one day ill make it on to this show.
GameSack This guy. Sounds. Gay
GameSack wedgeii2 The only way I know of is going to the top right corner beside the video, on your homepage, and clicking the x. It might be a glitch, in which case, your only option is to wait it out.
GameSack she said mario right the canadian way thats how italians say it and its an italian name you americans are saying it wrong :P
GameSack Next episode, smosh will be loser.  Fucking machinima passed them again.
GameSack good i hate the shaytards

GameSack partnersproject is a must if you are subscribed to TheWillofDC
GameSack i just noticed this but how come will has more suscribers than his most viewed video
GameSack This is so cool! How did JennaMarbles even get more subscribers than everybody else on YouTube last week? I think that this is the year of JennaMarbles because it wont be long now before shes 1 on YouTube! Dont you agree?
GameSack Noooooooooooo, Shaytards has to climb up the chart :(
GameSack Geez, I have nothing against gay people, but I could only listen to your voice for so long before all hell breaks loose.
GameSack So many YouTubers with over 1,000,000 subscribers..... Man this place grew since I started back in 07.
GameSack switzerland says hello as well! watch you since like a year :)
GameSack wait shes canadian...HEEEEEELL YEEEEA!!! but u do say mario wrong.

GameSack omg.. Will is SOOOOOOO Gay, And you know something? Im fine with that, as should others. I my self am not homosexual but I support homosexual rights :) and Gay Marriage :) Will ur laugh is so fking good.. Also whatup with werevertumorro? :P
GameSack I wish League of Legends was never made. Casual version of DotA with low skill cap and nearly all skill factors removed, attracts casuals and morons.
GameSack Werevertumorro es a Mexican (international) channel and he is doing well.
GameSack Smosh or freddiew should really be on the top 3 most subscribed :P
GameSack You look more buff than usual. You must be working out or something.

GameSack 1w4nn4 I agree, its ridiculous that she is climbing so quickly, shes almost overtaken Tobuscus!
GameSack Sad news about the Shaytards falling down a few spots, but their content really hasnt been up to par lately.
GameSack zuperzekrom same excel spreadsheet but much better room! lol
GameSack ZorkzoProductions ouch, thats a little harsh. i love a good hike, but i also love a good 3 hours playing mvc3. on ps3 of course, lol.

GameSack Almost time for WongfuProductions to join that 1 million subscriber club, GO Wongfuproductions!!!!!!!
GameSack I am canadian and i say mario as mario and not mayrio.. goodness gracious!
GameSack The Shaytards are not as entertaining as they once were. At one point I checked the Shaytards page waiting for a vlog to come out and now Im still subscribed but havent watched a vlog in months. For me NerdzRL is my favorite daily vlogger ever.
GameSack VICTORY! thumbs up if you get it
GameSack TheWillofDC wong fu productions just hit 1 million subscribers! im expecting a video soon :D

TopGear Add a message to your video
TopGear Mil gracias es lo mejor
TopGear Top gear usa lo mximo,el mejor programa de autos :D
TopGear vas a subir locos por los autos
TopGear HE WAS REFERRING TO THE BRIDHE YOU FUCKING SLOPE!!!!!
TopGear If she succeeds in suing the BBC this will only encourage others to look for racist comments in seemingly innocent programmes. Im sure that if they went back far enough, someone could find thousands of potentially racist comments in old TV programmes. The difference between then and now is that people used to have a sense of humour.
TopGear Gold digger.... Really pissing off theyre being sued for this... Shes nt even Chinese....
TopGear Wow, theres some seriously pathetic people in this world. Since when did Slope become a racist term you ever heard being used? Its absurd. It seems unfortunate that somebody was crossing the bridge at the time, but who? So the people who are assigning the word slope with racist intent automatically assume the person crossing the bridge is a slope? The woman sueing is the stuppiiiiiiiidest (Clarkson voice) woman alive. Theres not a bat in hells chance she can single handedly win a case like that without the racism being directed. Another dead end actress trying to make some extra cash, what a fool.
TopGear Somi Guha is racist in herself because she knows that the word slope has been a basic, core word for hundreds of years and has no ethical meaning in the slightest yet because the presenters are white theyre easy targets to accuse of racism. If we took offence at the Chinese word for flat for example Im sure theyll think were idiots if we try to sue them for having the word flat in a chinese TV show.
TopGear Never realised that describing the slope of a bridge is in somehow racist.It is not racist and would be a shame if the show got pulled.Guess it was a slow day for the lawyer. How do Asians manage to use a ski slope without being mortally offended ? Had to Google it, seems that as well as being used to describe a gradient, it is an acronym for Silly Little Opium Peddling Easterner. Much the same way that some irish gypsies are described as Caravan Using Nomadic Travelling Salesmen...
TopGear I didnt even know the word slope had other meanings until all this palaver, but having heard that I now find this segment hilarious.
TopGear I wonder how she feels about the movie Blazing Saddles.... Mel Brooks look out lol
TopGear SlopeNoun  A surface of which one end or side is at a higher level than another a rising or falling surface.He slithered helplessly down the slopeGoogle doesnt lie people.
TopGear I do see a slope and it is a little ugly one too.
TopGear Im sorry, but hes right. There is indeed a slope on it.
TopGear This lawsuit is the dumbest lawsuit ever, he said there is a slope on it I heard Richard say you are right, it is definitely higher on the right side.. I dont recall hearing, yea that guy on it is a slope.. Its comedy and humor which Top Gear is known for.. I woul hate to take the people out, who got offended by this, to a Comedy show.. Who knows who theyll try and sue
TopGear Clarkson has a robust sense of humour aimed as much at his fellow Brits as anyone else. The leftists clearly approve of humour at the expense of Brits with jokes at English, Welsh and Scots alike. However opportunists and their greedy and corrupt lawyers are seeing pound signs here.The legal test of the man on the Clapham Omnibus show be considered. Not shrill voiced activists seeking to attack (de facto) white people. These attacks and legal actions are not made against other races. The true nature of this is bashing white people with Clarkson being made an example of.
TopGear Pathetic. What about Fawlty Towers: The Germans, where the major talks about the difference between Wogs and Niggers, an then Fawlty insults the Germans for 10 minutes and does a Hitler impression. That still gets showed but nobody complains.
TopGear I saw a bunch of slopes during the winter Olympics. Does that make me observant, correct or racist?
TopGear I think they talk about the bridge
TopGear hate Somi Guha cant she just piss off and let everyone enjoy Top Gear, thanks to her everyone now knows slope is a racist word
TopGear Im a Singaporean Chinese. but i dont find it offensive, in fact, i had a good laugh
TopGear Wow. This brings back memories. I was 14 when some kid from another school called me a filthy slope (Im Chinese btw) playing soccer. My mate (big Caucaisan kid) jumped in, called him a fucking racist and threatened to rip his head off if he opens his mouth again. I thanked him on the bus trip back but had to ask, Graham...whats a slope? Ive been called chink and gook but never slope.This was 1995...and pretty much the only time in my life anyone used slope on me. Surely in 2014 its expired as a slur :)  Also 1.8 million?....Its a little cheeky but 1.8 Million for a silly little punjoke thats not even aimed at your own demographic??
TopGear Absolutely pathetic. never even heard the term, and if that was a joke, it was a pretty cryptic one. Furthermore, SOMI, i assume the word slope doesnt even apply to people of your own ancestry (and cant claim the whole of asia is offended by it). If anyone from Burma wishes to complain, let them do so. Why is she watching topgear anyway if she doesnt like jokes. And BTW the Texas trip would be a whole lot more offensive to Texans but amazingly none of them decided to sue the BBC wonder why (presumably because they arent so meanspirited and pathetic).
TopGear The lawsuit is stupid and Id be surprised if she won anything. Having said that, anyone who thinks Jeremy DIDNT know what he was doing when he said but...theres a slope on the bridge (while an Asian man was walking on it) is kidding themselves. It was an obvious jab at another race and Im sorry I had to witness that from someone I thought was a better man than that.
TopGear Farkin funny but... :
TopGear Big woop, get over it
TopGear Fuck off Somi, get a life, you idiot!! Viva Clarkson!!!
TopGear He definitely meant it. Hes the sort of piece of shit who takes pride in offending people. He says theres a slope ON it not theres a slope TO it so its obvious hes trying to be clever with his subtle racist joke. Its not natural otherwise for him to say on in this sentence. Hes not stupid and is generally quite eloquent. He definitely meant it. I think the lawsuit is a bit ridiculous but I do think Clarkson should be sacked by the BBC.
TopGear Get over it. I guess we should stop having the olympics as well... since commentators say snowboarders are going down a slope. Nothing will happen but seriously? what a waste of time and money for everyone
TopGear What a joke!! U cant say anything these days without some money grabbing fool trying to get their hands on some money. Perfetic!!!
TopGear I dont know why shes so upset, slopes are eastern Asians. Being an Indian would make her a Jobbycatching Currymuncher.
TopGear Lmao and people wonder why racism will never die... Because people like this will keep using it for their own personal agenda. 1 million, how about earn your own fucking money, and stop watching too gear you slope
TopGear umm how is this racist lmao
TopGear Gold digger.... Really pissing off theyre being sued for this... Shes nt even Chinese....
TopGear Get in the van, Jeremy! Right. Good. ???
TopGear I love the way the LFA sounds. Omg
TopGear Lexus LFA is no more better than 2014 Nissan GTR or AMS
TopGear I wonder if that Pete had a cat
TopGear isnt it funny when actuall truckers watch this thinking finally big trucks then this happened

TopGear wtf is with ruts voice
TopGear Did anyone see that ae86 in the background on the highway????
TopGear There was a darker history for the Challenger... It was a Mitsubishi at one time... Heres the deal, these are not Muscle cars, Muscle Cars are Charger RT, Ford Torino Cobra, Chevelle SS 396454 and 90 were automatics, I too would prefer a manual but that was not the norm for Muscle Cars, these are Pony Cars, always have been always will be.
TopGear The mustang is a pony car
TopGear voices are lower and its disturbing
TopGear Rutt shlda put a nose cone and a high wing and make a Daytona
TopGear post the truck trip to alsaka.

TopGear Lexus LFA is no more better than Nissan GTR AMS
TopGear Hmmm could tanner be the stig?? Only makes sense y pay two pro drivers?? Any comments please share
TopGear Hey Rut.... ya know if you had done 30, in the 30, and not 22, Im willing to bet youd have been sitting there waiting for the horse.
TopGear Whats with the voices?
TopGear An Aerostar?!?! Im so disappointed in you Tanner...
TopGear Adam used a different chrysler for the river cross!! CHEATER!!!!!!
TopGear you can ford a fjord in a ford, but you cant fjord a river.
TopGear Why does it sound like they all have deep voices that sound the same? :S
TopGear I want to know what the crew was driving to break the trail ahead of you. I highly doubt they were in another van. lol
TopGear Well, thankfully you had a helo watching from above so if one of you bit the bottom of the canyon they could find the body. lol

TopGear Do your self a favor,watch british topgear.Omg they just copy the british version, no new ideas.Terrible waste of time
TopGear i dont like rutliges limo
TopGear I really tried to watch a full episode of us edition, but line with cubic inches just made me sick...
TopGear Yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
TopGear Why does he need the lipstick?
TopGear jesus dude, if your going to upload a vid at least do us the favor of taking out the stupid recap bullshit every 5 minutes. not to mention the first 10 minutes of the video repeats itself.
TopGear Why do they keep making it sound like everything they do is dangerous its obviously not or els they wouldnt be doing it. Fucking american pussys
TopGear People are so mislead... Dont you all realize that most vehicles suck ass in the reliability department out of the factory? It really comes down to how well you upgrade them and your driving. Also, Toyoda Land Cruisers are based off of the Jeep. And money is also a big factor. Are Hiluxs better than these trucks? Probably, but these things probably cost half as much and are at least 30 years old. And today its a hit and miss on what cars are good and ones that are not. Some Japanese cars are really good, others not so much. Some years of a model are great, other years not so much. Same thing goes with American vehicles. You also have to look at the geography. America, in general is very flat and has a lot of straight roads. And what do American cars do? They go very fast in a straight line. European and developed Asian countries tend to have a more hilly country side setting with a lot of loops and bends. So what are European and Japanese cars good at? Cornering. There is no good way to compere apples to apples with these vehicles. The voice of logical reasoning has spoken, thank you.
TopGear Theyre voice is changed its not theyr normal voice
TopGear i hope that bronco has a 1000 gal tank cuz that things gotta get loke 2 mpg
TopGear did they have to replace the bike LOL
TopGear aye tho aye! this show sucks and also that Scout II isnt an original. It has the Axles from an FJ Land Cruiser! Therefore this truck is part Japanese! Japan made it up there! and besides that. Only Japanese trucks have made it up there more than once. Bring these trucks down and take em up again. They wont last another mile lol Well maybe the FJ Axles will. But you can take those off that piece of shit Scout and re use em on a better truck like an actual FJ Land Cruiser
TopGear I want the vehicle that carried the camera crew, they obviously had no issues.
TopGear Ok nevermind tanner sounds funny too lol
TopGear Why the distorted low quality video?
TopGear I would have the tank which Richard Hammond (Hamster) used and a Toyota Hilux
TopGear Whats up with the voices there so low pitch?
TopGear do a viteo in a sandking
TopGear What adam why arent you talking ? New voice
TopGear Sometimes it sucks to be American because of you idiots.
TopGear Haventhey not heard of james may, who did tbis DURING theberuption
TopGear The crews using jeeps and ford trucks for the land clips, helicopters and those flying droid things in the air
TopGear This Chevy might not be the fastest but it sure did save everybodys ass more than once. Thats a Chevy for ya! :)
TopGear Really, the stock IH 345 replaced by a Chrysler 318, idiots!
TopGear Why is the sound dropped an octave?
TopGear What is the camera crews truck? Toyota Hilux? :D
TopGear just wondering if these guys have ever heard of tire chains
TopGear the irritating thing about this program is that they lie about what they do. they are not the first up there since the eruption! Arctic Trucks was there right before under and right after the eruption! they have guided tours up there! you cant claim your setting a record when your driving the same place as the tourists! the REAL top gear did it good! they took a trip too the north pole with an Arctic Trucks rebuilt Hilux! and made a race of the trip buy competing with Hammond and a dog sled. thats something too talk about.
TopGear Wow Americans are stupid.
TopGear LOL, great to watch but the really over hype the danger. They know exactly what is ahead....they have camera crews and producers tagging along and up ahead to set up shots. Almost as fake as the ice road trucker idiots.
TopGear I want to sleep in that little house
TopGear WHY THE FUCK CANT WE GET GOOD QUALITY??!!
TopGear I dont know which is worse, the sped up voices so they sound like chipmunks, or the slowed down voices like on this video so they sound like its all dubbed. This blows. Why cant anyone post videos like the UK show videos? I need to just buy the series if I can find it.
TopGear Theyre voice is changed its not theyr normal voice
TopGear im sorry why is a range rover shit the normal top gear uses them as film cars they go everywhere and fyi the best off roader is a defender
TopGear what about the bmw x5? that thing rolls very nicely.
TopGear Top gear us is a load of shit compared to the original top gear uk
TopGear adam suv is the best but the ford suv is beter then all of them
TopGear What is the music at 27:27?Who does it? It sounds awesome!
TopGear I would clearly get the subaru
TopGear I live in MN and I cant find a 300zx for 2 grand what the fuck
TopGear You should come to Nova scotia, and let me drive lol
TopGear Why do they show the sky
TopGear man up you guy its not that cold
TopGear were are they in minnesota
TopGear whats with the Shitty overdub on the audio??
TopGear Way to go...keep on perpetrating the myth about If you dont ride a Harley...dont show up in Sturgis... It aint funny or relevant to most Enthusiasts...stick to cars ya Squids...
TopGear so every episode has screwed up audio.. congratulations!
TopGear Please upload more top gear videos they are awesome
TopGear Lmao that drag race was awesome
TopGear 3 seconds faster than the Merc, AND having Rutt in the passenger seat? Leave his ass on the sidelines, bet the Stig would get under 1:10.
TopGear Ok. Sooooo this 100,000 car is the way of the future, and Im supposed to be enamored to buy one? Even with the 10k government rebate, its still 40k more than the truck I want. So lets see. 40,0003.70 a gallon is 10,811 gallons of gas that I can buy for my truck. Thats 338 full tanks, or appx 172,000 miles, which the way I drive will last me about 5 12 years, thus paying off the truck and getting a new one at that point. That 100k car, which Ill never be able to afford wouldnt save me enough in electric bills over the fuel for my trucks in my lifetime. So they can kiss my country boy redneck ass, and shove that 100k electric car of the future where the petrol dont shine. Ill take my 4x4s any day. Besides, living in western NY in the snow belt, Id love to see that little POS get through our winters without getting towed. Stupid aholes that live in the heat build cars based on where they live and expect the world to acclimate??? HA!!!
TopGear What happened with getting the photos on the 50 yard lines of stadiums?Did I miss something?
TopGear thanks adamUr epic im Hornywana do it
TopGear Adam, youre inspirational with your American spirit, but Im sorry... Im a Lambo fan currently in love with a McClaren. The Viper.. just no interest.
TopGear The voices are fucked and it cant stop loling
TopGear TANNERS AWESOME AND TOP GEAR UK IS LAME LOSERS
TopGear top gear uk rocks and this isnt bad but no comparisn against the original uk version
TopGear Tanner is horrible with girls XD Im pretty sure he is just acting :p Top Gear UK is so such much better though!
TopGear Love the Boxter, but seeing it here it just screams midlife crisis. The corvette is the classier one period.
TopGear Whats with their voices
TopGear American super cars are faster the Hennessy venom gt is the fastest car and its a American super car
TopGear That Ucra is no Super Car, a Super Car must do it all, be nice, handle great, fast as hell with all modern conveniences such as AC, heater, stereo and a ROOF.
TopGear ...You would thin the presenters would know INFO about there car...Not to mention there was no Veyron SS...
TopGear If I was there It would be there it would be the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport 100
TopGear Lool. They lose on purpose. Every european car was better on dvery way then us cars
TopGear European Supercars are better than American Supercars like from Europe You can have a Ferrari, Aston Martin, Lamborghini, Porsche and Mclaren
TopGear Ive bitched and moaned about the voices so much, but ya know something?... I love this show so much, Ive discovered I no longer really care. The only part that still gets me is how the camera sort of shows the sky and not the action a dozen or so times per video.. that part still sucks. lol
TopGear What about the Copperhead ?
TopGear The kuttless is the best
TopGear The new z28 actually beat the Nissan GTR skyline in a road and track test on Motor Trend TV
TopGear When the soda all fell i laughed and drooled sprite out of my mouth. So funny
TopGear Is top gear in canada ? i sure would love to drive something, either testing it out or a challenge
TopGear And mine was home made 2 about 130 proof
TopGear I was 13 when I had my first drink if moonshine and I didnt make a face big girls
TopGear I thought alot of car guys have heard of Morgan...
TopGear am i the only one who would want the Toyota over the rest maybe the dodge for a laugh
TopGear that dodge is awesome
TopGear Ill get the toyota rather than any of those
TopGear Chevys are the best. Ive got a 49 year old chevrolet c20 fleetside sitting in my front yard. Aka, a 1965 chevy pickup. Great truck, built to last.
TopGear I dont see why the Toyota would be so bad, in top gear UK its called the car that never dies.
TopGear i want them to do a SUV challenge and to get a chevy suburban
TopGear iv got whisky n guns probably the best line out of the whole episode
TopGear Whats wrong with their voice
TopGear I would so love to do a tuff truck challenge with these guys
TopGear if adams axle did not snap he shoudt of won
TopGear Noooooooooooo! The house XD
TopGear my 91 powerwagon has over 300k miles on it and has original motor and tranny. never owned a ford or chevy but my dodge is still running strong
TopGear My latest ford truk product had a trans failure under 100 k miles and after warranty Currently not considering ford for its replacement especially since ford would not consider any discount ...
TopGear Bacana ein? Show... eu era bom demais nesse jogo. O foda era anotar os password num papel pra jogar em um outro dia... kkkkk

TopGear Hamster in a suitcase in a cargoplane?
TopGear Goodluck chaps.May the best manmachine win!
TopGear who cares the show has been shit this season. why do a season in the wet season any way. plus they do laps twin and split screen fucking annoying. they did a shitty piece on the P1 no hot lap. the Porsche 918 had sponsored placement written all over it. top gear is slipping!
TopGear Come on, Captain Slow!
TopGear As you can imagine, Ive done it properly... :)
TopGear its got nothing to do with how obsolete tv stations are becoming. The problem is that certain TV shows in certain countries are not paying enough money to get the shows on air. Peer to peer acts as an avenue to advertise the show people that do not have a huge budget normally use peer to peer to advertise their products, and it is proven that they still make a lot of money using peer to peer as an advertising tool. Making back money with DVDs etc etc. Game of Thrones is one of the most pirated TV shows ever but they still make over double the amount of money that they put in the show

TopGear i remember watching this interview (full and HD) somewhere else, cant remember exactly where. why it wasnt broadcasted anyway?BTW thanks for uploading it!!! Loved how he said ...your accent youre so sneaky with American accent.
TopGear Better than nothing I say.
TopGear Well even if you recorded this and part 2 with your Android and hands, its all good, because your the only one Im able to find with the full interview. So thank you :)
TopGear And you need to get a tripod for the camera. or a recording hack device.
TopGear Can you please tell me what kind of potato this was filmed on?
TopGear lol this was funny! XD
TopGear He does not like coming second.
TopGear big thanks for posting it 3 and bless you for subtitles!
TopGear FFFFF HES HERE IN TORONTO AND I HAVENT EVEN GOT A CHANCE TO MEET HIM YET
TopGear I worked hard. In the military. Then I received a massive head injury the complications of which precluded me from being able to drive a car. How refreshing to see people on the internet propose the brilliant notion that bicyclists deserve any type of violence that comes their way. Makes me glad I live in the 21st century.
TopGear WORK HARDER. lol i bicyclist hit my mirror so i kicked his spokes in. here in new mexico the law is give bikers 3 feet. if they would give me three feet i wouldnt have a broken mirror. i need a truck to run em over
TopGear All rights to this shameful shite owned by the BBC? Abolish the BBC. No to the license fee!
TopGear What is this song called?
TopGear Drivers are usually fat.
TopGear Pure genius. Cyclists are the most self entitled jackasses on the Earth today.
TopGear brilliant, funniest top gear for ages, priceless, was in hysterics watching this.
TopGear Who ever has subscribed to my channel i would like to say thank you

TopGear I hv them water speakers
TopGear Surprised to see the V8 pass the GT3 on the straight, or am I missing something?
TopGear Lol how about you show the good people whole race. After 3 laps Erebus got their arse handed to them by the Super bike, Red Bull F1, and the Time Attack Mitsubishi Evo. The bike came first, Evo and F1 equal second and the Merc 3rd by a long shot followed by the GT3 Merc and WRC Corolla.
TopGear Get in the cockpit of a MercedesBenz SLS GT3 race an E63 V8 at the Sydney Motorsport Park.

TopGear llllloooooll the end where the nissan gtr goes
TopGear i am staying in Dubai and i cant wait to go to Wild Wadi! The waterpark in this video
ZONEofTECH Sorry for the delay guys!Editing this took me more than I expected. Topped in at 48h (my personal record).Just to give you an idea on why it took me so long: spent 3h picking the right background songs for the video and edited every single image that I used, in photoshop. Took me ages to find the imagesvideo I was looking for.At least, after 48h of work I am 100 satisfied of the outcome.Hope you are as well :)DanielZONEofTECH
ZONEofTECH Has anyone told you, you look like captain sparklez?
ZONEofTECH I dont get the health bit. Is this the only direction Apple can see going? is this the only thing left?
ZONEofTECH I use my iPod nano 6th gen as a watch!
ZONEofTECH Oh the contradictions...
ZONEofTECH I dont personally think they would use saphire glass because it would have no felixibility therefore making it an ipod nano with a bit of a better resolution and much more stronger. It would make more sense to use willow glass.
ZONEofTECH is it me or does he look exactly like Andrew Garfield???
ZONEofTECH I think the I watch will come in different colors like the I phone 5c
ZONEofTECH U kindda look like the new spiderman
ZONEofTECH flexible glass?bullshit that cant be real.
ZONEofTECH (Rote this before watching the entire video.) If apple makes one, they can try and make a better one than the ones that are already out. lmao They can look at the current ones and make theirs better.
ZONEofTECH Really well made video! Youre a smart guy!
ZONEofTECH I like it it would be awesome
ZONEofTECH Would you be able to call on the I watch kindve like a a miny phone
ZONEofTECH this might take alot of space (maybe because i know KINDA nothing about memory) but if they combind all three of those charging ideas, while your walking outside or inside, the light shines on the watch to charge it and your moving at the same time so it does the double of charging. If you charge it on the panel thing or in that charging case then it does kind of the same but its not moving and the bulb doesnt produce as much as light but it still can almost 2 times the charging without a plug (kina). Again, I dont know if they could do that or even fit that in a small tiny little device  the 5 to 7 days battery
ZONEofTECH Freakn awesome YouTuber
ZONEofTECH Id like to know how that glucose meter works
ZONEofTECH ipod nano 6th gen was my first apple device, it even had my name and birth because i bought it on the internet.and then SOMEONE STOLE IT!
ZONEofTECH Yes make that video please, I need to know the differences
ZONEofTECH Um lol they have already released a smart watch. Go on the website and see for yourself.
ZONEofTECH iPod touch 6th gen? No one intrested in that?
ZONEofTECH how is it going to fit different wrist size????
ZONEofTECH daniel ur videos are so coolur so coollets be friends
ZONEofTECH dude this is fake apple watch
ZONEofTECH Oh my god it is the amazing Spiderman. :D
ZONEofTECH The Todd Hamilton one is awesome I would buy that.
ZONEofTECH Lol how on EARTH earth pops up lol
ZONEofTECH Speak italian...PLEASE
ZONEofTECH This should solve Americas obesity problem!!!!
ZONEofTECH I just hope apple comes out with something better than whatever else is out there  Samsung gear, Pebble, etc. just a Nano like the one in 2010 with Bluetooth, ability to view notifications, reject or answer calls, weather. That would do it for me. Maybe the ability to respond quickly to texts  yes, no, ok, sounds good, on my way, etc.
ZONEofTECH why not use all of the types of charging that he mentioned
ZONEofTECH lol spongebob and patrick cartoon
ZONEofTECH How About the social aspect?Twitter, Facebook etc.?
ZONEofTECH Sapphire can shatter fairly easily, so it may not respond well to drops. Its fantastic for avoiding scratches as anyone with a nice watch can tell you.
ZONEofTECH Shouldnt forget water proof swimming is a sport to
ZONEofTECH Does it have a camera
ZONEofTECH You look like Andrew garfield
ZONEofTECH Dude, you should get a lav mic. Itll really help the quality of your videos.
ZONEofTECH I hate how people are so worried about battery life. You charge your phone every night, is it that hard to just plug a cord in along with your phone?
ZONEofTECH I hate how people are so worried about battery life. You charge your phone every night, is it that hard to just plug a cord in along with your phone?
ZONEofTECH I have an IWatch its awesome
ZONEofTECH i dont think they will use solar powered cuz wat if its snowing and there is no sun?
ZONEofTECH seriusly now apple is copying samsung
ZONEofTECH the ipod nano is pretty much a iwatch with that strap, im going to use my moms unused ipod nano and do dat
ZONEofTECH The song is new game by nitro fun
ZONEofTECH Will iPhones and iPads be getting iOS8
ZONEofTECH poorboy in a fueter video, so maybe in the past to?
ZONEofTECH If it was up to me I would use solar.
ZONEofTECH Ok Im gonna say it. Dude you look so much like the actor Andrew Garfield. He played in The SocialNetwork and The Amazing Spiderman
ZONEofTECH I am a new subscriber and I love u videos
ZONEofTECH why do you promote stuff like clarence and cell phone companies
ZONEofTECH Calling on the Iwatch would be a lot better
ZONEofTECH Keep up the great work.) Love your videos.
ZONEofTECH I hope apple allows Siri on the iWatch. As far as iOS 8 I would like for Apple to allow 3rd party developers the ability to integrate Siri functionality into their apps. Im a huge fan of Siri as you can probably see
ZONEofTECH U KNOW JUST BECUZ U PUT AN I IN FRONT OF EVERYTHING DOES NOT MAKE IT APPLES IDEA THEIVES
ZONEofTECH The same stuff he is saying is the same stuff people are guessing on the web... Ask yourself how does he know all of this again???
ZONEofTECH They should try doing the phone thats in total recall. It is installed in your wrist and charges of the electricity in your brain
ZONEofTECH i think it will turn out shit
ZONEofTECH Cause u can play xbox in school
ZONEofTECH Movement and solar charging would be a good combination
ZONEofTECH That cartoon clip really sucks
ZONEofTECH No thats for the iPhone 6
ZONEofTECH 17:20 you played the Boston Bruins theme.You like the Bruins?
ZONEofTECH Will the glass make it more expensive?
ZONEofTECH Smart watches are useless, why not do things the old fashioned way? Its really not necessary to have a smart watch..
ZONEofTECH I can understand why Andrew Garfield is hosting these types of videos... Peter Parker is a genius you know. )
ZONEofTECH I want to see on the Apple iWatch I want to see people calling each other and possibility txt on it idk maybe
ZONEofTECH you repeat a lot of things in your video
ZONEofTECH The best prediction yet
ZONEofTECH i like your videos man keep up the good work
ZONEofTECH Youre awesome Im from Mexico and I almost dont understand when someone speaks in English but I understand you :D
ZONEofTECH Display technology !!
ZONEofTECH I will buy it if, it can make phone calls!
ZONEofTECH I have one nano 6 with a wrist band :D
ZONEofTECH its gonna take you alot of japanese punchlines to charge that gyroscope
ZONEofTECH NOTE The iWatch  Final Leaks  Rumors video is taking a lot longer to edit, than expected. This means that I will most probably upload it this Wednesday so stay tune for that. That video shouldve been uploaded before this one but since its Monday, I had to upload something for you and this one was a bit quicker to edit(still spent 14h :)
ZONEofTECH My favorite is a picture you have shown, but didnt mention, of basically an ipod that flexes and bends around your wrist. it would be super awesome, especially gaming elements if they designed them right, which is what apple has been doing for quite a while now.On a rather unrelated note, this picture also inspired a truly scifi concept: iClothes. Clothes (or just a body suit) that is made of flexible glass, and is fully customizable what it shows. Just picture that. Fully wearable electronic screen. Everywhere on the clothes fully customizable. If youve seen Continuum, think like that suit, except wearable flexible glass, and probably not bulletproof.
ZONEofTECH I would say the 2 is soooo AWESOME!!!! )
ZONEofTECH these look so genuine!! great video
ZONEofTECH number one makes perfect sense. Something to compete with samsungs galaxy gear...... hopefully!
ZONEofTECH I like the thick band idea of Concept 2... But Concept 5 looks the most plausible
ZONEofTECH I actually like the one better than two because it is more practical, but two is still amazing
ZONEofTECH One because two is going to a long time
ZONEofTECH The iWatch concept by Zach( FinalCutPro) King is my favorite
ZONEofTECH number 3 is more realistic in my oppinion
ZONEofTECH oh sheet i saw her passcode trolololololol
ZONEofTECH Add some chamfered edges to Todd Hamiltons design, and then you have Jony Ives iWatch!
ZONEofTECH of course i would pick 2 but we all know that can take a while until it is made but if i would choose a concept that can be ma with the technology and engineering that we have today, then i would pick concept 3
ZONEofTECH 4 was my fave but 1 is a close second!!!
ZONEofTECH number 5 is real good iwatch s but number 2 is real.. because great magic... idea
ZONEofTECH I think I like 5 best lol
ZONEofTECH Number 2 is the Best!
ZONEofTECH 3 concept is nice, but controlling area is too less.
ZONEofTECH On 3 it said Oktober not october
ZONEofTECH mine i like the second one
ZONEofTECH I cant wait until 2019!
ZONEofTECH 5 was best and most practical
ZONEofTECH Loved number 2 but none of them had headphone jacks
ZONEofTECH THANK YOU FINALLY SPELLING FAVOURITE RIGHT!!!!!!!!!! IT HAS A U PEOPLE GET IT RIGHT
ZONEofTECH Number 2 is the best but i like number 5 aesthetically
ZONEofTECH I like the first and second one
ZONEofTECH can you talk about the new mac book pro 2014?
ZONEofTECH fave was number 2, it was PHUCKING AMAZING!...but the problem with number 1 is, how do you adjust the size of the watch for large or small wrists?
ZONEofTECH I love number 2 But number 1 is the moste realistic
ZONEofTECH you look like the guy from spider man
ZONEofTECH My favorites were 5 and 2 the look like they would be taken out and released
ZONEofTECH ma favorite in 2 ! luv it :)
ZONEofTECH My Favorite iWatch concept is 5
ZONEofTECH Number 5 and 2 are sick
ZONEofTECH We wanna hear from u more often!!!
ZONEofTECH Very passionate and knowledgable
ZONEofTECH there is a problem with the concepts... wheres the headphone jack?
ZONEofTECH Haha you played my gymnastic display teams warm up routine music!!! Zombie Nation (except a slightly different version
ZONEofTECH At number 2 they said thats how the Iphone 5 will look...Now they say thats how the Iphone 6 will lookNext year they going to say that,thats how the Iphone 7 will look
ZONEofTECH i would buy number 2 the moment it comes out
ZONEofTECH i had tons of fun watching this!
ZONEofTECH 1 and 2 were my favorites
ZONEofTECH wow, where can i get a hold of Farahi to come do rendering for my co.? )
ZONEofTECH i like number 1 concept,,,
ZONEofTECH Is it just me or does he look like Drake Bell??
ZONEofTECH Numbers 1 and 3 looked pretty cool
ZONEofTECH Number 2 I remember a cpl years ago people at Apple were going to try and make something like that but they failed it and said screw it were making something else
ZONEofTECH The favorite one is is the third and this is how is it going to like but not the same but at least similar like that but I loved the 2nd one
ZONEofTECH I think 4 needs to be longer...lol
ZONEofTECH Sorry to said this video is Rubbish
ZONEofTECH number 4 must be a pisstake
ZONEofTECH HAHAHAHAHAHA South Africa in the World Cup Final! XD
ZONEofTECH 1  2 iPhone 6 CONCEPT
ZONEofTECH put my appnana code in d3036472
ZONEofTECH Last year I was looking at phones nuber 2 poped up and I staerted rumers at school. Lol
ZONEofTECH did anyone else notice the fire thing at 38 or 39 seconds?
ZONEofTECH I can even understand what their saying because their accents
ZONEofTECH Number 4 is kinda silly
ZONEofTECH Number 4 killed me lmao!!!!!
ZONEofTECH How can u use no 4 as a phone though :
ZONEofTECH 5 is absolutely ridiculous lol
ZONEofTECH number 1 is so sick!!
ZONEofTECH 5 would be good but hilarious and 2 is good              5 ok 1 pistal 1780 the king of the something mabee
ZONEofTECH Usually dont post comments or videos on this account usually do it on MetalsnakeMC but check out the 4th on this video
ZONEofTECH number 2 is my favorite concept, and it will remain that way for a long time
ZONEofTECH he called number 4 parody? yes, it is hhaha the rest can be awesome
ZONEofTECH Number 1 is cool but there is no way there would be 4K video the hard drive would have to be huge to support that kind of resolution. Plus the mini aux thing would cause a riot because people would have to get new headphones or adapters. Still really kool though!
ZONEofTECH My favourites are 1 and 2....
ZONEofTECH HE LOOKS LIKE DRAKE BELL
ZONEofTECH definitely 3. or maybe 5
ZONEofTECH Of course apple is probably going to blow everyone away like they always do and only one of these ideas will be right... Like it usually is. I sure apple has some surprises in store.
ZONEofTECH You kinda look like andrew garfield
ZONEofTECH I only believe 1 will actually happen
ZONEofTECH guys name of the song for number 3 please :)
ZONEofTECH I love the number 1 iPhone. I would work my ass off just to make the money to get it lol.
ZONEofTECH the 1st one would make Apple even mor popular and rich and it Looks amazing
ZONEofTECH For 2 if it was a projection it wouldnt reflect (under the projection)
ZONEofTECH number 1 doesnt have that classy Iphone finish, it needs the screen to have sides in my opinion.
ZONEofTECH 1 and 2 was mine also
ZONEofTECH that guy holding the iphone as virtual guitar is Babak Ferdosi the guy working for NASA , he was a part of curiosity mission to Mars :D
ZONEofTECH i have seen the number 2 spot many times before and its deffenetly my favorit
ZONEofTECH The auxiliary port for the headphones on number 1 is the only problem
ZONEofTECH Concepts are too high end for Apple
ZONEofTECH i love the thinness of 1 and the probability of it happening. But lets put the keyboard and monitor projector on it too! Thats so sick!
ZONEofTECH I think the iPhone Air was the best. In my opinion this is what Id expect from iPhone 6. :D
ZONEofTECH Peter Parker!!! What are you doing here?
ZONEofTECH Number two would be awesome
ZONEofTECH 4 they were saying iPhone 5
ZONEofTECH Sorry but all of the iPhone 6 videos are a complete lie an when you reply I will tell you why
ZONEofTECH I would day number 1 and 3. 5 was quite funny. Body time? Lol
ZONEofTECH No.4 is the craziest iP concept ever, they should design the special pants with very deep pocket for it.LOL
ZONEofTECH 5 is cool, but I doubt the government would slow that
ZONEofTECH Its not going to be a drastic change even though its going up a whole number their just going to copy something someone else did and TRY to make it better
ZONEofTECH Would be amazing if they would make it like 1
ZONEofTECH it will be gangster as ! if they come out with projectors!
ZONEofTECH 2 is my favorite. We need that. I mean if me have google glass we can have that
ZONEofTECH Its FINALLY HERE!iWatch  Final Leaks  RumorsNEW Apple iWatch  FINAL Leaks  RumorsIf you enjoyed my iPhone 6  Final Leaks  Rumors video, this one is even better :)Enjoy!DanielZONEofTECH
ZONEofTECH Almost 200.000 views and 2243 LIKES!!I simply have no words for this!Youre all amazing! A thank you simply isnt enough..So Ill go with a bolded THANK YOU!:)
ZONEofTECH please make a blooper :)
ZONEofTECH is this the guy from amazing spiderman
ZONEofTECH Omg you look like Andrew Garfield! Hawt.
ZONEofTECH So basically, its going to be a big piece of shit like all of the other iphones?
ZONEofTECH Man, 2 million hits, youre doing great, dude! Probably because your videos are so well done. I see big things in your future!
ZONEofTECH Aluminium? lolz great vid
ZONEofTECH Just go to boy genius report..
ZONEofTECH are you the amazing spiderman???
ZONEofTECH Iphone 6 will be an iphone5 just renamed.I find it funny how people always believe the leak pictures of iphones how they are made of glass or about 4mm thick.Steve jobs said they will never make a smaller ipad, yet they did because they wanted to compete with the 7 tabs.Same thing here, they will go 400ppi if they must to compete.
ZONEofTECH i liked it thank you!! :)
ZONEofTECH Because apple didnt have screen cracking issues before. Now they are going with a stiffer, more brittle display. Which means that as soon as it touches anything, its just going to spontaneously blow out
ZONEofTECH he reminds me of the guy from Social Network
ZONEofTECH Whats the deal with apple copied android android copied apple nonsense? When new technology develops every brand has to have it. Would they just not put it in there devices because if so then that means the brand that has the technology has the advantage in sales because everyone wants it. The sales for which ever brand that did not put the new technology in there devices will be facing bad sales. And we all know that every brand is money hungry. Basically what ever is new all brands will have it no matter what.
ZONEofTECH All your guesses are certainly interesting, but Apple never seems to release an array of monstrous upgrades like your video walks through  so my guess is that maybe one or two of your guess, maybe even three come true IF that. Still would be cool though. Def worth all the holding out some people have been doing for iPhone 6 hopefully.
ZONEofTECH Yea ill be waiting for the Iphone 6s
ZONEofTECH There actually starting to copy Samsung looks....oh apple never ceased to amaze me.....such pitty.
ZONEofTECH What is Apple trying to do make a phone into paper?
ZONEofTECH Yesssss apple made another shitty simple ass I phone I bet all the simple ass people bye this simple ass shitty phone sounds about right way to go apple another year waste of bullshit . . .
ZONEofTECH They make a new iPhone every 3 years or so, its not even been 1 year yet, I doubt they will have even decided on anything for the iPhone 6
ZONEofTECH You mean aluminum ? Lmao
ZONEofTECH this guy looks like amazing spiderman
ZONEofTECH No it is grapine I bet half of you guys nevrer heard of it
ZONEofTECH Yea a new iphone! Now that should do with my 5s? make a video of different ways to destroy it ! :)
ZONEofTECH Ya apple for having the same crappy display for 4 years without improving! Join android and get some quad hd action...
ZONEofTECH if the battery is gonna be the same im not buying it iphones have such shitty battery life and sometimes the battery gets fucking hot as shit
ZONEofTECH Im wait for the Iphone10! Lol
ZONEofTECH I expect to see apple doing a lot to try and compete with the Samsung note 3. I do see the possibility of it being water proof and having a solar panel on the back, thats a lot of unused real estate thats perfect for a solar panel. I think it can be water proof if it solar charges or pad charges and has wireless headphones and touch sensitive buttons (no pressure). I think they really need to increase the internal speaker though. Im hoping to see 128 as a standard capacity and enough power to run mac software cross platform. The ability to run mac software would definitely dominate the competitions offerings for software on the go.We need desktops on the go that can go to the beach swimming with us lol. I would also like to see the nanos radio put into the phone for dataless radio on the go.
ZONEofTECH In the middle of the video it shows a picture if tuberculosis
ZONEofTECH He looks a lot like Drake Bell.
ZONEofTECH you said everything so perfectly
ZONEofTECH Since when does Andrew Garfield do youtube
ZONEofTECH Um Bluetooth charging? Impossible
ZONEofTECH what does tuberculosis means?
ZONEofTECH Hey look! Its jeff gordon!
ZONEofTECH U look like they guy from amazing spiderman )
ZONEofTECH wake me up when apple make a full HD screenfaster processer.
ZONEofTECH thanks for the infos...
ZONEofTECH How many times have you guest the right thingg
ZONEofTECH Cool can you make a drop test???
ZONEofTECH Andrew Garfield??? is that you??
ZONEofTECH Galaxy note 3 competitor would be iphablet by apple and they better patent the name before someone else think of it! Lol
ZONEofTECH YES my bday is in august xD(getting iphone 6)
ZONEofTECH wireless charging? are you crazy?
ZONEofTECH You look like spider man
ZONEofTECH dude u look like the guy from the amazing spiderman
ZONEofTECH Great video, but that drop shadow
ZONEofTECH He looks so much like Andrew Garfield lol
ZONEofTECH amazing spiderman....
ZONEofTECH How about flash player
ZONEofTECH you look lyk andrew garfield... (guy from amazing spiderman)
ZONEofTECH That like in description sick man
ZONEofTECH Hey can u give us some leaked scenes of amazing spider man 2 Andrew Garfield??
ZONEofTECH Take the iPhone 6 we have a real time communication to the phone based on official AI you automatically change into full voice mode when you move above 20 miles an hour and I dont think theyre going to make any bigger day have a lot of parts from the iPhone 5c so we will see colors
ZONEofTECH Your videos are too long.
ZONEofTECH Is it me or do you look a lot like Andrew Garfield?
ZONEofTECH I need to get a joooobbbbb
ZONEofTECH Shall I wait for iPhone 6 or just buy htc one m8 or s5?
ZONEofTECH He looks like the Amazing Spiderman
ZONEofTECH Why would they do anything different then the iphone 5s? Its sad that people expect apple to do something different for once.
ZONEofTECH Everything he described will be seen in iPhone 7 lol
ZONEofTECH The creator died hello anyone knew that
ZONEofTECH Good thing I got no contract on my galaxy s5 to switch on this baby if its any good when it releases
ZONEofTECH Apple is stupid, they could have released a bigger screen with the same resolution years ago, the PS Vita has slightly lower res but is quite a bit larger (5) and still looks great.
ZONEofTECH Who else thinks he looks like the new SpiderMan?
ZONEofTECH i like androids, but i prefer apple. no hate for either side. cant we all just get along?
ZONEofTECH I was paying attention, as a matter of fact i paid too much attention. What you have to understand is that the bigger the phone and faster the processor it can still drain the battery just as fast even when they say youll get 12 hours video playback (that doesnt mean anything especially if you havent got a real life experience with the phone yet) and sometimes those promising phones dont live up to those expectations. Dont believe the hype and everything you hear, research it first.
ZONEofTECH I wonder how much of the audience are actual Apple users.
ZONEofTECH Does anyone else feel Samsung always rushes into launching their new technology slightly too fast? :
ZONEofTECH Should of made a red one :(
ZONEofTECH April 11th huh? well happy birthday to me, literally haha
ZONEofTECH Looks nice... not THAT MUCH of a difference, but then again Im still using the GS3 cause I didnt see much of an incentive to get the 4... maybe Ill get the GS5 or the Note 3 (If only theyd come out with a GS with a built in Spen).I really dont get the complaints about the plastic backs.... 1st: If you DONT put your smartphone in a case, youre a flippin idiot, so what does it matter what the back looks like 2nd: THANK GOD I can remove the back case to change out batteries AND additional SD cards... again, you have to be an idiot to buy a phone that is sealed with no way of expanding memory or easily putting in a fresh or new battery and 3rd: WHY would any intelligent and practical person PREFER to have the extra weight of a metal brick in their pocket (what, that huge new phone isnt heavy enough for you?) and WHY would any intelligent and practical person want a phone surrounded by glass all around (that new expensive gadget isnt delicate enough for you?) and 4th: why would any practical person prefer a more expensive phone just because its wrapped in stainless steel or aluminum when it will just be covered up in a PLASTIC protective case anyway... DUH. It just comes down to shallow vanity... and besides, you look like idiots covering up your TOO delicate, TOO heavy, and TOO expensive fruits with those GIANT Otter case within a case within a case within a case.... I LOVE my GS3... and although the GS5 isnt an earth shattering new model, all I truly look for is: ram, memory, battery sizelife WITH easy access, and SD card capable... and Samsung has delivered in ALL the truly important areas, with the added beauty of their HD screen and camera.My ONLY regret is that its a Googleandroid phone... I used to love Google, but I have grown to HATE Google in the past couple of years, with that hate growing more and more every passing day. With as much as I love Samsung GalaxiesNotes... I have to confess that my disdain of Google is pushing me towards an iPhone or Windows phone in my future. Google seems to have gone off the deep end and seems to THINK that we LIKE being dragged with them eventhough were kicking and screaming the whole time... they have gone blind, deaf, and dumb to us regular users... they have shown they simply dont care about us anymore... they are no longer our heros... they have become our oppressive captors instead... am I the only one who remembers that same tyranny from Microsoft in the Nineties???Google SERIOUSLY needs to get back to their roots and remind themselves of what made them so different and so beloved in the first place.
ZONEofTECH Whats the price of the Samsung galaxy s5?
ZONEofTECH cant understand a bloody word they are saying ugh!! they should have people who speak fluent English to demonstrate their products!
ZONEofTECH Wtf is this? Opera or a tech event? Samsung has lost the plot, honestly!!On the side note, when is Samsung starting to recruit the 2014 shills? It appears that this is a good place to start. Is gonna need it with the HTC one coming soon. And god help Samsung when iPhone 6 comes )
ZONEofTECH i beleive that all this video is fake and i phone is the best mobile!!!!!yyyeeeaaaahhhhhhhhhhh i phone for ever!!!!     !!!!!aloha!!!!!
ZONEofTECH No no no Apple is the one that be rushing they stuff like remember when they came out with the iPhone 5 then out of no where the 5c and 5s like what the heck
ZONEofTECH it doesnt even look well presented i got bored ...
ZONEofTECH It comes out today right?
ZONEofTECH Skip to 2000 to skip music intro and music
ZONEofTECH This is major disappointment after a great phone like S4, what were they thinking with the band aid design?
ZONEofTECH so does the gear have a cam?
ZONEofTECH Lmao.. The David park guy had to clap for himself for people to cheer..... hahaha
ZONEofTECH Why the heck did i get a 5s!? Big mistake. Apple is crapple. Going back to the better side soon:)
ZONEofTECH I only came here to laugh at thr shitty design and the stolen ideas from other companys
ZONEofTECH I like the intro music better than the phone
ZONEofTECH TheRandomActivity first off iphones will always sell more that copycat samsung and dont fucking argue with that because its very clear who copied who. All i gotta do is look at the homebutton on the iphone and galaxys and know that samsung was inspired by apple. And by the way what makes samsung better? Useless features lol cmon the iphone can do pretty much everything samsung still cant do when its jailbroken. Samsung still cant fix their lag and their phones break much faster than iphones
ZONEofTECH All you speak English types do know that Samsung sells more phones outside the US than within, right? That to them, this is more of a global event?
ZONEofTECH Do u have somebody with better English words
ZONEofTECH i mean a vid of how it is more for sure it is going to be
ZONEofTECH SAME SONG AGAIN AND AGAIN...
ZONEofTECH In my opinion the most important things on a SMARTPHONE are that u can change the Battery, water resistance, camera and the features. I dont think that iPhone will ever have a better camera, features and so on. If u want a nice Design and a very simple phone then take the 5s. But if u are someone who want to make something more with a Smartphone then i would take the s5 or the z2. But the men buttons Integrated in the Display sucks as well. So 5.2 inches at the z2 turn to 4.7. Samsung is the best choice i think. I have a s3 and i hate it, i sweared that i never buy a samsung again. But the market show me that the samsung is the best choice. My friends cant go through a half day with a iPhone because of the low Battery. HTC is not a option at all and the only concurrent of the s5 will be the z2 for the Moment. Waiting for iPhone 6
ZONEofTECH 18:50 to skip all the bullshit
ZONEofTECH its quite hilarious watching the 12 year old stone aged isheep kids bash and troll the galaxy which is clearly in every area better than your icrap, yous cant handle yourselves can you? your iphone days are dead little ones, the battle is moving towards the android OEMS now, not stone age devices which were very similar for 7 years LMAO!
ZONEofTECH Just cause they will have the s5 in Gold as well, that color will knock out the sales the first week its release. iPhone and galaxy s5 sales will be very similar during that first week, I bet.
ZONEofTECH When he said the gear 2 was sheek I thought he said shit
ZONEofTECH WOW! So upset right now! Hello innovation anyone same shit dif day. Lets see what The fruit guys come up with.
ZONEofTECH glad i got a 5s and htc one... looks the same as the s3
ZONEofTECH i have iphone 4 ios 5.1.1 and i update my iphone to ios 7.0.6 from iphone setting and now i have apple logo on and off, can u fix it
ZONEofTECH Just remembered that I forgot to add transition effects!! DANG IT! I did the final touches at 6 a.m (spent the entire night working on this  again) and apparently completely forgot to add those :(
ZONEofTECH You are totally correct about the increase in ppi wont make much of a difference. But the increase of resolution does have some benefits. It gives the option the stream your devices display to an external 2k display in its native form (not really usefull for the masses) and the development of a higher res display will push other things like saturation and viewing angles. In the end I do think that a 1080p display is the best resolution for a high end phone because most of us wont see the difference, it benefits battery life and performance. But everyone knows that people in reviews will be all about the 2k resolution and how great it is, and we all know that annoying friend who brags about this display: which is exactly what Samsung wants (they are not dumb you know :)
ZONEofTECH Very good info Dan I sure like your vidz. I like that you also added the fact that Apple usually take stuff from other companies and make it thire own because I know some iSheeps will say that Samsung are stelling from them!Lets see on Monday if your predictions are correct :)
ZONEofTECH When OPPO told the customers that they would be releasing a FULL HD display smartphone couple of years back, people went crazy. They idolized Jobs of his idea of whole eye cant differentiate above 326ppi and all. But none of them had the same opinionthought after they used a FULL HD smartphone. Who knows ? Maybe its the same case here ps, Im a pixel junkie. I could see the irregularities in the curve in the display of the 5S while compared aside to the HTC One
ZONEofTECH I like living here in Silicon Valley
ZONEofTECH He looks like Andrew Garfield
ZONEofTECH Samsung has nothing new but a better camera on the new phone. Apple will once again out sell Samsung because Apple actually have something new to offer. If the iphone 6 has a 5 inch screen...game over. Cant wait to get the 6 and the awesome iwatch coming out.
ZONEofTECH Samsung Galaxy S5Specs, Camera, Features,Price  Release date!
ZONEofTECH Can u help me root my s4 19505 qualcomm updated to 4.3 thanks
ZONEofTECH apple is going to have a 5.5 inch screen for the iphone 6 ,but thats when the note 4 comes in with way better features than iphone 6 and s 5 .the note 4 will have 5.9 inch screen
ZONEofTECH Im normally very skeptical about watching a rumour video from a source thats not trustworthy, but you truly did a great job.
ZONEofTECH Can someone tell me what time will unpacked5 be at e.s.t?
ZONEofTECH Keep up the good work..Excellent presentation....
ZONEofTECH Very Nice Presentation. This Galaxy S5 Will Rock The Tech World But I Still Interested in S4 Coz The Complete Internal Innovation of Smartphone Sensors Started From it!
ZONEofTECH You look like Peter Parker from the amazing spiderman )
ZONEofTECH help with cynegeaonmod please. Ive tried it twice and almost broke my phone once.
ZONEofTECH I Think that they will add Panerama (If they dont already have it....)
ZONEofTECH Great video again Dan. So detailed and yet such fun to watch....as i said before in my tweet, really appreciate your editing skills my friend. Keep em coming.As for the S5, waiting for it and planning to buy as well. Hope it pleases all of us. P.S. Loved the blooper....ally :D....double thumbs up just for that only )
ZONEofTECH I feel so outdated I just got the s3 last june
ZONEofTECH How do we get Kit Kat on Samsung Galaxy S4?
ZONEofTECH you look like the new peter parker in amazing spiderman
ZONEofTECH Actually that was a great video , but I would expect s5 will not have a removable back cover if it will be made of metal..like iphone!!
ZONEofTECH Cool Video, liked it.
ZONEofTECH Friday! Lold at the Rebecca black reference xD
ZONEofTECH This is an awesome video! :) I heard from another rumor from ayoutuber that the backing would be metal like on the iphones.
ZONEofTECH Samsung Galaxy S5Specs, Camera, Features,Price  Release date!
ZONEofTECH apple is going to have a 5.5 inch screen for the iphone 6 ,but thats when the note 4 comes in with way better features than iphone 6 and s 5 .the note 4 will have 5.9 inch screen
ZONEofTECH Keep up the good work..Excellent presentation....
ZONEofTECH Keep up the awesome videos. :)
ZONEofTECH Over 10 hours of editing and this is the result!Samsung Galaxy S5, Galaxy Gear 2 and the NEW Galaxy Tab 4 :)
ZONEofTECH Over 10 hours of editing and this is the result!Samsung Galaxy S5, Galaxy Gear 2 and the NEW Galaxy Tab 4 :)
ZONEofTECH I agree with your second theory. Personally (on another topic) I dont see the need for more than 2030 apps? So many of the apps could be just boiled down in their categories since they seem to perform the same functions.
ZONEofTECH Amazing review bro keep up the good work. You just got a new subscriber!!
ZONEofTECH What time will the meeting start in Eastern Standard Time in the US?
ZONEofTECH Hello under 30 club!!
ZONEofTECH they are not announcing a tab 4
ZONEofTECH actually some people are saying that it will be unveiling touch wiz 5
ZONEofTECH S to the question of whether the Galaxy gear 1 was a prototype or if the Galaxy gear 2 is a rushed replacement, I can think of a third option. The galaxy gear 1 was a test of sorts. It wasnt a prototype as you indicated, but rather a concept test to see what the market was before ramping up production and RD. It is likely that Samsung was developing multiple versions of the Galaxy gear at the same time. The gear 1 was only a proof of concept model to generate interest in such a device. The gear 2 will be the culmination of the original design and the feedback from the gear 1. This means Samsung wouldnt have had to redesign from scratch in only 5 months, instead, they would have been designing since the RD department first proposed the gear concept. My guess is that the gear 2 has more than a year of design and development under its hood.
ZONEofTECH I think Samsung probably wanted to see the market reaction to the new product and the high price was to keep people away from buying the product and only a few people would actually buy it.
ZONEofTECH cant wait for the revel of the S5
ZONEofTECH Nice video editing !!!
ZONEofTECH Great video. Like it. Subscribe to see the news for the S5.
ZONEofTECH Notice the  Dancing ZoT logo at the end of the video which vibrateschanges colour depending on the music rythm. Took me around 5h to make that. I will be featuring it in all of my next video.BTW  quick side note: started recording the video at 7 a.m. Finished editing and uploading at 9 P.M. So yeah...Ive worked 14h on this (actually 13:30 because I went out to get something to eat).Like if you think the video turned out well and you appreciate my 13h and 30 minutes of work :)Thanks!DanZONEofTECH
ZONEofTECH Yuddy I did mention the possibility of them being take. Watch my entire video please.
ZONEofTECH You look like Andrew garfeild
ZONEofTECH If the back is full aluminum, then Ill be pretty impressed if Apple somehow pulls of phone calling, and any signals in general.
ZONEofTECH Sonny DICKson Ahha I was watching this right In front of my parents nd they take the video off and watch another one too joke
ZONEofTECH BIG DEAL .... UMMA BLACKBERRY LOVER ... IPHONE 1 ,2 3,4 ,5, now 6,7 ... HOW BORING ... SAME SHIT JES A COUPLE NEW FEATURES DIFFERENT SIZE SAME SHAPE .... BLACKBERRY HAS A NEW ASIAN CEO JOHN CHEN ..... WHO IS GOING TO PUSH BLACKBERRY TO THE NEXT LEVEL ... (the leak is hopeless jes to get these Iphone ppl pumped up ..
ZONEofTECH if that isnt fake i bet its actually the 6th gen ipod touch
ZONEofTECH i really like this iphone its so cool
ZONEofTECH I dont understand the race to having bigger displays. Any bigger and its a small tablet. I dont want anything bigger. I want it to fit comfortably in my jeans pocket.
ZONEofTECH its the same bullshit leak lies every year... thumbs down for tard video!
ZONEofTECH Same shit happened last year and before that and before that... and same shit was released over and over again... XD
ZONEofTECH good ,My online shops have ,
ZONEofTECH It looked very similar to the galaxy did anyone notice that
ZONEofTECH At 3:08..... If you know what I mean......
ZONEofTECH iphone 4s was released october 4th the day before jobs died
ZONEofTECH why is aluminium so important?
ZONEofTECH Why all the dislikes this is a great video
ZONEofTECH ulgy iphone the new Galaxy S6 look better I hoe it goin b faster
ZONEofTECH I think that the iphone6 will have a 2.4quadcore processor and 2gb of memory RAM and also an 12 megapixel camera with a led flash fingerprint will stay as she is in iphone5s but the frontal camera will be bitween 2 and 5 megapixel the storage is 163264128 and the display will be bitween 4.7 and 5.5 inch that what i think :)
ZONEofTECH I think that its the type of design apple will use. Im not sure about it being real
ZONEofTECH You look so much like Andrew
ZONEofTECH If this is the real iPhone 6 I dont really like it as it has a bigger screen and they are copying Samsung and they dont want to do that!
ZONEofTECH It is going to be the same as all of the others they never Change. The galaxy is way better
ZONEofTECH oh and 2 GB of ram and quadcore.
ZONEofTECH Im the 42,000 Subscriber :D do i get a prize :)
ZONEofTECH Can you give me the link of the last second background sound I really like it !!!
ZONEofTECH Love when he says aluminum lol
ZONEofTECH Copy sumsung galaxy s4
ZONEofTECH So, its actually a shitty samsung galaxy ripoff. Bravo Apple, bravo.
ZONEofTECH My mom still uses her NOKIA 6110, what is the big deal about all these IPHONE and Samsung?? as long as you can send messages, make calls and received calls all are fine, nokia old phone and my old trusty motorola which are key pads phone are good and made for people who are honest folks, you can text while having a dump, while eating, while driving, while talking to someone with your fingers instinctively knowing where to press, while masturbating, HELL I can even stroke my girlfriends twat and suck on her breasts and ass, having sex while looking and texting on my trusty motorola phone..what is the big deal about all these Iphone and Galaxy??? it is expensive, goes out fashion in a flash, this is just a way for these people to cheat our hard earned money for things we do not really need...if you want to check out the internet and work on your computers just stick to your PC or laptop...bunch of nonsense, this is the classic story as depicted in the Stephen Kings horror novel Needful Things you people are sad people, havent got a life??? just waiting for the latest phones from these big companies cheating on peoples money...GET A LIFE YOU SAD MISERABLE PEOPLE, there are better things to do than to comment of what is and when is the next phone coming!!!!
ZONEofTECH The iPhone 6 you shared Kind of looks like a Samsung phone
ZONEofTECH Needs a better battery
ZONEofTECH Does it come with elephant glass protection
ZONEofTECH It looks like that the headphone slot moved back to the bottom of the phone
ZONEofTECH you can tell the display size by using the lightning connector as a reference
ZONEofTECH West. For. I phone. 6
ZONEofTECH How big is it... Im talking about the screen size just to be clear  lol XD
ZONEofTECH Looks like Samsung s3 on front
ZONEofTECH your audio is weird sounds muffled
ZONEofTECH It was a fake I just now bought my I phone 4, waiting to get the I phone 6 when it comes out.
ZONEofTECH omg it looks exactly like the samsung thats so stupid
ZONEofTECH i pone 6 will have a touch screen on the side and will chang shape and size
ZONEofTECH Thats retarded. It looks like an Android.
ZONEofTECH Ill slAp some 1 if they buy this shit
ZONEofTECH I just hope they move forward with the OS...
ZONEofTECH Spot the boring dork that really needs to.....GET A LIFE!DEATH TO IPHONE, LONG LIVE ANDROID!
ZONEofTECH Will it have a colour screen though
ZONEofTECH So to summarize Apple copied all the Android Manufacturers with the bigger screen?
ZONEofTECH it is called CONCEPT...!
ZONEofTECH Your very handsome c: js
ZONEofTECH This shit looks stupid it really look like the galaxy dont copy our screen size apple
ZONEofTECH just a photoshopped ipad mini anyway.
ZONEofTECH What is the point of making another iPhone when you could just keep on making updates and features for the original iPhone?
ZONEofTECH Looks like someone put a iphone button on a gs4
ZONEofTECH Good quality video!!! All is good.... Info, audio, video, etc... Good job!!
ZONEofTECH Iphone 6 looks the same to me.It just little bit bigger.I think Samsung Galaxy S5 is better than up coming Iphone 6.Thats my opinion.
ZONEofTECH Good review however somewhat not true. Apple did decide to change the iconic home button. The 5s doesnt have the square due to impairing the fingerprint reader. Other than that great video man! Love your stuff
ZONEofTECH when will this iphone 6 out?
ZONEofTECH People say that apple is copying Samsung but Samsung copied apple with the galaxy s5, it comes in gold and blue and has fingerprint scanner I mean come on bumping up the screen size is not copying if it was then LG would be copied too!
ZONEofTECH How do you know what it looks like
ZONEofTECH hy sir can u help me i m facing issue in ipad3 its getting off and on means batter logo and apple logo coming then again off,plz help me may be software issue.plz help me sir,i will be so thanks full to yougod bless u
ZONEofTECH fake ! iphone fans keep dreaming !!!!  waiting for the samsung s5
ZONEofTECH The iPhone 6 looks like a samsung galaxy to me
ZONEofTECH Why is nobody else putting the speakers on the front of the phone like HTC!? Its so much better!
ZONEofTECH I Saw On The Back Side The Text There Was iPod :P
ZONEofTECH Apple iPhone 6, tiny bit bigger...... Nothing else Hope you douchebags enjoy last century technology! Getting fucked by Apple over charging and rated piece of shite! And of course Apple will be changing the: chargers, headphones and accessories. Hope you lot have fun being fucked over!
ZONEofTECH So...completely off topic, but anyone else notice this guy looks like David Tennant and Andrew Garfield had a baby?
ZONEofTECH ok we get the design we know what itll look like they have 789 all lined up its milk technology
ZONEofTECH apple is to scared to change the model
ZONEofTECH Wow! Apparently this is my 300th video. Ive always wanted the 300th video to be something special :D Didnt even know this was it! :)

ZONEofTECH Do you want a robot for your iPhone or Android phone?Meet the NEW Sphero 2.0!
ZONEofTECH Do you want a robot for your iPhone or Android phone?Meet the NEW Sphero 2.0!
ZONEofTECH Before you keep saying the game is fully playable you should actually play the game. Your are in a closed off interior section with no enemies or action going on walking back and forth doing absolutely nothing lol. Try gliding around the city, fighting 10 bad guys outside or doing a boss fight and see if you get those frame rates. I never understand why people who make these videos always try always show the minimal amount of stuff going on and say its so playable at these specific settings. Then when unsuspecting people try it they are in for a rude awakening. Very deceiving is what Im talking about.
ZONEofTECH If its only got 512gb then its not top of the line
ZONEofTECH What the point to buy macpro and install windows on it ?
ZONEofTECH Nice videos!, i found it really helpful
ZONEofTECH Thanks for the info. You make me choose that model. You always make great  quick reviews.
ZONEofTECH How about FIFA? Can you test it?
ZONEofTECH Would you do a video, recording gaming performance held against noise levels of the computer? That would make me a happy man, and you a tad more awesome! (Thanks!
ZONEofTECH First comment after zone of tech!
ZONEofTECH Can you do a benchmark of Diablo 3 and Starcraft II on this Mac through MacOSX?
ZONEofTECH Is this being run on bootcamp or are you dual booting (not sure if thats even possible since I dont have much experience with Macs). Just wondering whether to buy this system or not
ZONEofTECH Great review. Please make a video with this game running on intel iris pro. Thanks!!
ZONEofTECH A question, when you connect you laptop by hdmi. Does still have the same performance?
ZONEofTECH NEW VIDEO!Batman Arkham Origins on the NEW 15 Retina MacBook Pro!Performance test
ZONEofTECH what kind of temps are you getting while under a load like batman.
ZONEofTECH i wanna see my fraps too how can i make this is that a special programm what ist the name?
ZONEofTECH Hey are you use window 64 bit or 32 bit i install in my macbook pro 15 with window 32 bit. Its doesnt work. Dont know how to do.
ZONEofTECH 720p is amazing for laptop gaming, anything higher is just over kill. Specially when using any monitor under 24.
ZONEofTECH DAYUM, Well thats just the same specs as an AlienWare 17x
ZONEofTECH can you do one on Dota 2? it might not be the most intensive but since you already got steam and its free :D plsssssssssssssssssssssss
ZONEofTECH u know plugging in a montior decreases performance by 1020 fps
ZONEofTECH Not on my version. Thats because I got mine from a pirate ship ifyouknowwhatImean :))
ZONEofTECH Are there any settings that will give you average 60 fps with MB Pro in BF4 anyone?
ZONEofTECH WOW  Its better than the alienware 17
ZONEofTECH What about temperatures? With Formula1 it goes up to 90 C ...
ZONEofTECH Lowering the res to 720 and enabling antialiasing still makes it look good on high graphics
ZONEofTECH how can you play battlefield 4 on mac? a special program?
ZONEofTECH Its a beast! So happy I bought it :DDD
ZONEofTECH Just got the game, downloading to my 15 retina mbp 2013! :D
ZONEofTECH Could you play bf4 online as well?
ZONEofTECH Are you going to upload video about Call of Duty Ghosts Retina MacBook Pro (Late 13) performance:  ? :D
ZONEofTECH That was windows 8 in the beginning of the video not Mac OS, soo the bf4 gameplay was played on a windows machine
ZONEofTECH Thanks for sharing this!
ZONEofTECH Can you do a Starcraft 2 the Heart of Swarm Ultra graphic setting test on Mac version?
ZONEofTECH Thanks for the vid mate!
ZONEofTECH Hey man! do you need a cooling pad for hour long gaming with bf4?
ZONEofTECH Can u post call of duty black ops 2
ZONEofTECH 1)install windows 72)turn the stupid aero off 3)play it laptop screen OR turn off the laptops screen and play it on your monitor.if you really want to get the real graphics performance thats what you gotta doall this in my respectfull opionion
ZONEofTECH Can you use the gt 750m and the intel iris pro 5200 like an sli ? you know like use both gpus at the same time.
ZONEofTECH u use parallel desktop?
ZONEofTECH Omg u bought for like 2499 ? U can buy an asus g750jx with intel i7 and a gtx 770m and 1 gb hhd 250 of ssd and a macbook air with this amount of money . I feel very sorry for you
ZONEofTECH nice vid bro....my macbook coming tomorrow
ZONEofTECH What do you use to convert it to hdmi?
ZONEofTECH Whats your outro song called?
ZONEofTECH Dude how do you play bf4 on your macbook????
ZONEofTECH NEW VIDEO!Battlefield 4 on the NEW 15 Retina MacBook Pro!
ZONEofTECH Hey if you want, you can try recording with nvidia shadow play, it supposedly would impact performance less.
ZONEofTECH Do u post just Mac gaming on your channel
ZONEofTECH Not trying to bash, I have a Macbook Pro 13 2012 myself, but this is pretty sad. This is barely better than a PS4 or Xbone, and costs 4X or more.
ZONEofTECH are you using an xbox controller ?
ZONEofTECH sigh... It was battlefields fault for crashing, not the laptop. That game has more bugs than anything made by Bethesda.
ZONEofTECH this is good for me. I dont expect the most beautiful experience on a laptop. Besides, this sure beats the shit out of my old 2008 aluminum macbook :P
ZONEofTECH You just got a sub. You make all the videos I wish for.
ZONEofTECH Love your intros man! :D
ZONEofTECH Gregory Jungling He is probably using Boot Camp included in Macbook Pro
ZONEofTECH I am sooooooooo disappointed with the Intel HD graphics.On some games anti aliasing isnt even a option with Intel HD.Why a 3000 laptop with a bargain TV?
ZONEofTECH thx for sharing. Game, better with alienware...
ZONEofTECH Nice video. Nitpick: Windows does support High DPI since the XP days, so way before OSX. Their approach doesnt work as good in practice as the Approach taken by Apple, but it works reasonably well.
ZONEofTECH This is sweet!When do you plan on putting up the Batman video? Also, how hot does it get when gaming? Great video, cheers!
ZONEofTECH u can actually hear the fan boosting which means the macbook is struggling to be cooled.
ZONEofTECH What do you use to emulate Windows ?
ZONEofTECH Go to display option ans you can bump everything to 150200 larger just like mac.
ZONEofTECH Hey man ! Do you need a cooling pad for hour long gaming sessions?
ZONEofTECH kindly do do the video of the iris pro and the nvidia 750
ZONEofTECH do u have company of heroes 2 ? in some places Company of Heroes 2 requires more hardware performance than Crysis 3.
ZONEofTECH Hey! Thank you for your test!
ZONEofTECH NEW VIDEO!Crysis 3 on the NEW Retina MacBook Pro!
ZONEofTECH subbed. might be sold on this machine.
ZONEofTECH Hey zoneoftech, thanks for the helpful video. i had this same model arrived yesterday. Even after updating my graphic card i cant get this performance on my macbook. I also had razor game booster and my nvidia 3d settings to default. Its worse. Can can you help me please.Thanks
ZONEofTECH Nice helped me out quite a lot
ZONEofTECH If i dont give all of the memory to bootcamp, will it not work as well?
ZONEofTECH so are you using bootcamp, or a software of some kind?
ZONEofTECH Proud to be part of this network :)
ZONEofTECH I had the black iPhone 5 for a year and a half until two weeks ago but my 5 was perfectly spotless. But I actually take care of my phones, I dont just throw them in my pocket with my keys or pens and everything
ZONEofTECH Actually u have an English accent
ZONEofTECH we love Romenia kiss from Serbia
ZONEofTECH He is right theblack is the best iphone 5s and better than the gold that sucks dick
ZONEofTECH Dude I like your video but very bad quality
ZONEofTECH The box is flat to match the new design of iOS 7
ZONEofTECH When you was unboxing it, you said here we have the iPhone 5C.
ZONEofTECH My boyfriend has the black slate iphone 5 and there is not 1 scuff on it and he doesnt even have a protective case
ZONEofTECH Hallo isnt german, its dutch haha
ZONEofTECH NEW video!Retina MBP: Graphics  Performance benchmarks!:) Apple  RetinMacBookPro  Benchmarks MacBook MacBookProRetina
ZONEofTECH Lol the intro is a free template :3
ZONEofTECH Im on a PC at the moment, but Im thinking of buying this retina macbook.Intel Core i7 4880k 3,7ghz Ive bridge ECorsair 32gb quad channelGeforce GTX 660Samsung 512gb ssd22 TB WD Black 7200rpm
ZONEofTECH How much did it cost?
ZONEofTECH Hi I just got the 2.6ghz, 1 terabyte ssd. 15 MacBook pro yesterday. This thing is powerful. For premiere pro and after effects, I had to download the nvidia cuda unlock. I cant believe how smooth it runs with multiple effects. I am very happy with this machine. Final cut pro runs like a champ too. However, mts files must be transcoded. I gotta try few games and see how it performs.
ZONEofTECH I have a early 2011 13 Macbook Pro with 2.3 GHz i5 and 16 GB ram plus a 256 GB SSD My Geekbench 64 bit was 6657. I compared it with a couple of 13 retinas and I was on par with them. Their scores were 6724, 6695, 6627.
ZONEofTECH Mine will be here tomorrow, after being delayed by UPS (was suppose to have it Friday.)
ZONEofTECH 4:20 The developers were racist HAHAHA XD
ZONEofTECH The developers were racist... LMAO!
ZONEofTECH How many FPS can that produce with high setting for games with high graphic needs (like Saint Row IV  Hitman Absolution)?
ZONEofTECH Is this a for review onlygiveawayable(?) or your own macbook?
ZONEofTECH hey  can you do a comparison between the early 2013 15 2.8Ghz i7 16gb  768 ssd retina VS a late 2013 haswell 2.6Ghz i7 16gb  1TB pci flash retina???????????????????????????????????
ZONEofTECH Still rockin the old school 15 design from last year. 512mb GT650m has been decent, cant wait to get hold of the 2GB 750m!
ZONEofTECH Youre awesome man, you need more views and subscribers!
ZONEofTECH Hi just wondering if you knew If I could upgrade my Graphic CardSSD without voiding my warranty and apple care?
ZONEofTECH Great job, looking forward to the gaming tests. I know the RMBP is not designed for gaming but its interesting to see how it performs.
ZONEofTECH Hey Dan!Is there a bug in StarCraft II:Heart of the Swarm that allows you to play as random or all of the races
ZONEofTECH Good work! I just got the same rMBP, but the 2.6 model!
ZONEofTECH How is the 2.3Ghz model the top of the line when the TOP of the line model is actually 2.6Ghz?
ZONEofTECH When will the full review come out? Great work btw keep it up!
ZONEofTECH NEW video!iPhone 5S vs iPhone 5C!FIGHT!

Quick question though... do you think spending the extra bit of cash for 2.6ghz is worth it? Is there any noticeable difference between 2.3 and 2.6? Im doing video and photo editing and I wont be upgrading for another 45 years.

ZONEofTECH I thought iPhone 5S was going to win
ZONEofTECH i thought apple has optimized their OS to 64 bit xD
ZONEofTECH Regardez cette vido sur YouTube :

ZONEofTECH cant wait for it to come out in the USA
ZONEofTECH The black iPhone 5 looks awesome but I prefer the Space Gray color, it lasts longer because its less prone to scratches.

ZONEofTECH You didnt do a review about it. im gonna have an iPhone 5s!!!! im so happy!!! Ive been waiting for this moment for two months!!!

ZONEofTECH If the owner of iPhone 5s is sleeping then someone else could easily put the owners finger on the scanner and unlock the iPhone.good going apple!
ZONEofTECH Your english is really good though!
ZONEofTECH i would say that the gold version would be cool if they had it in black and gold or space grey and gold in stead of white and gold! Go Space Grey! :)
ZONEofTECH I liked all your videos
ZONEofTECH i dont read terms and conditions they are a waste of time and i dont understand half the text
ZONEofTECH Hey what a coincidence Im also Romanian. Ce faci? Haha

ZONEofTECH Space grey a lot nicer
ZONEofTECH yes...... i am having an iPhone 5 black(slate) since dec 2012......... and till the date my phone doesnt have a single scuff at all....... its still looks the same when i bought it......
ZONEofTECH am I the only one who thinks he looks like Andrew Garfield or ... ?
ZONEofTECH I like the gold version
ZONEofTECH The part about the iPhone 5 Black  Slate scuffing, my friend has a black  slate model, and she has like, AWFUL scuffs on it, I actually thought she dropped it or something. But she said her case did it, so I believe it happens due to cases.
ZONEofTECH The video doesnt really start until around 4:00.
ZONEofTECH I have a iPhone 5 slate black purchased back in April. It wears a magpul iPhone 5 phone case and its been dropped 5 times with absolute no damage on the phone, literally looks brand new and no sign of wear on the anodize finish

ZONEofTECH NEW VIDEO!iPhone 5C vs 4S  BOOT TEST
ZONEofTECH Do you mind but can you tell what me(us) what song you use?
ZONEofTECH The music is too loud
ZONEofTECH NEW VIDEO!iPhone 5C vs Galaxy S4  BOOT TEST!
ZONEofTECH The real winner is the galaxy S4. Im not joking, I see in slow motion.
ZONEofTECH The boot test doesnt matter if theres nothing to actually boot up praglom kidsom
ZONEofTECH Huh lol my s3 boots up in 15 seconds on stock and a lot of apps and games
ZONEofTECH Apple is originalsamsung copy fake
ZONEofTECH Yes, there will. Unfortunately I dont have the 5S yet....its out of stock everywhere. So youll have to wait a bit longer for that :(
ZONEofTECH I agree with you Darek Burch
ZONEofTECH Stock? You mean stock android?
ZONEofTECH nice! there will be a video with 5S vs S4 also?
ZONEofTECH No impresive at all. Who cares which reboot faster the problem is which is more useful in your life Faggots
ZONEofTECH I have s3 (alittle modified build root deodexed etc) it starts up way faster than this 2. cant imagine how fast s4 can be with some modifications
ZONEofTECH Yall should stop hatin he is trying his best to entertain us with these nice fones he takes his time to show us
ZONEofTECH no sweat, at least its good to know that you try your best for the subscribers :)
ZONEofTECH NEW VIDEO!iPhone 5C vs iPhone 4S FULL Benchmarks and Speed test!
ZONEofTECH That wasnt as big a blow out as I thought it would be
ZONEofTECH u look like andrew garfield
ZONEofTECH Yeah but one has A6 the other has A5, what kind of comparison is this?
ZONEofTECH Why is his iPhone 5c 1.25 GHz mine is 1.30 Ghz
ZONEofTECH They are not on the same WiFi network
ZONEofTECH Honestly get the 4S.. Its a far more premium device..glass, vs plastic..and steel antenna bands.. It was once flagship..and 5c just a cheap plastic phone..Get the 5s if you can..always get the flagship phone
ZONEofTECH dude,why dont you compare Nokia 3310 and iPhone 5S? this video is pointless.
ZONEofTECH To actually figure out which phone is faster both phones have to be brand new and never used. Otherwise it is unfair and the chip in the 4s is obviously older which means it has been weared a lot more than the 5c. So obviously 4s is going to be slower. plus the iphone 5c was optimized for ios7 and 4s wasnt. Therefore this is an unfair comparison and wont actually prove what phone is faster. since the 4s is loaded with ios7. ios7 is just an extra to slow down the 4s.
ZONEofTECH Seriously, you look so much like Andrew Garfield! (Peter Parker from The Amazing SpiderMan)
ZONEofTECH I have an iphone 4 but Im getting a 5c in 26 days
ZONEofTECH just buy another brand, why apple ? . iPhone 4S is outdated and overpriced
ZONEofTECH If dont have enough for an 5s buy A 5...
ZONEofTECH I currently have an iphone 4. Should I buy an iphone 5c or wait 5 months for the iphone 6?
ZONEofTECH People People come down the whole point in this Video was to see which is better. If you cant afford a iPhone 5S
ZONEofTECH Well no wonder the 5c is better it is an iphone 5 in a plastic shell
ZONEofTECH Yeah ok so firstt the iPhone 4S is actually made for iOS 6.1.3 but is COMPATIBLE for iOS 7 while the 5C is actually MADE and OPTIMISED for iOS 7 so it would be more fair making the same tests with the 4S on iOS 6.1.3 and the 5C on iOS 7 !!
ZONEofTECH my iPod touch 5th gen took 33 secs interesting
ZONEofTECH Its not fear comparison since the iOS 7 was not made to speed up 4s, make a video with both devices on the first iOS they had, that will be fear, and iPhone 4S on iOS 5 was extremely fast even better than iphone 5s on iOS 7
ZONEofTECH WOW!!!! He looks like Andrew Garfield.
ZONEofTECH Of the IPhone 5s is to Cheap for you, than the iPhone 5c is also to Cheap
ZONEofTECH I love my iPad 2 it is the best iPad. I also have a iPad mini but its not as good as my iPad 2 if you are going to but a iPad then but a iPad 2 x I know this is not on iPads
ZONEofTECH I think the iphone 4s looks so much better. I dont care if he is a little bit slow.
ZONEofTECH just saying I have a feeling ur bullshitting most of this because the iphone 5c wont win in everything 3 times as much
ZONEofTECH And also I dont like the fact that the 5C is plastic .
ZONEofTECH I still have the iPhone 4 O.O
ZONEofTECH I just won a iphone 5c for 120 also fixing the lcd so it will be my everyday use and it will replace my iphone 3g. Come on iphone 6.... when are they going to launch it..
ZONEofTECH I think that the 4s has an advantage over the others because it just looks BEAST where as the iphone 5 5c and 5s look like shit because of the metal baclate
ZONEofTECH The iPhone5C will not break because its too cheap. It costs 570! Ali, youre crazy.
ZONEofTECH The hone 5c is crap no one likes it
ZONEofTECH I cant believe that the 5c is that much faster when the iphone 5s creams the iphone 5c
ZONEofTECH iphone 5c won at 28 seconds
ZONEofTECH can I have your iphone 4s
ZONEofTECH This video doesnt make any sense we all know the 5c is faster since it has the A6 Chip and the iPhone 4s has the A5 Chip
ZONEofTECH The 4s has the mail up while the 5c doesnt.
ZONEofTECH Although 5C is faster, in therms of design I would definitely choose the 4S
ZONEofTECH I have the iPhone 5S in gold
ZONEofTECH Just because its plastic its not rubbish, that makes no difference wot so ever
ZONEofTECH I have the iPhone 5c and its just like the iPhone 5 and it Actually feels nice in the hand not cheap at all and I like the improve meant in the camera overall this phone is worth it
ZONEofTECH Dude that was the 4 not 4s
ZONEofTECH Will he stop speaking ?
ZONEofTECH oh god peter parker of the amazing spiderman!
ZONEofTECH Lol!! Screw you!!! The poly carbonate dint help the iphone 5c!!! Its too damn flashy and looks a bit funny!! Coming to technical views 4s is much better than 5c!! Pretty boy grow up!!! 4s is a Steve Jobs revolutionary product!! :) 4s is still a good phone than 5c :)
ZONEofTECH Are you from Czech Republic?
ZONEofTECH Obviously the 5c is quicker its got a faster processor so this test is just pointless
ZONEofTECH Send me a free one then ?
ZONEofTECH Which one is louder .?
ZONEofTECH what music is playing at final?
ZONEofTECH I was gonna get the iPhone 5c but my mom ended up getting me the 5s I guess you could say Im lucky!
ZONEofTECH The iPhone 5c will break tho because its too cheap
ZONEofTECH Ifruit! Hope youre keeping Chop happy.
ZONEofTECH your own 4s has problem!!its to slow!!!in all!!itsnt true!!only the first 3..is better!!butmy old nokia has boot time 10 sec!!!its better from ALL??4 5 6 7 my 4s is exactly the same EXACTLY THE SAME with 5c
ZONEofTECH Im just saying its fast
ZONEofTECH I am still I love with 4s the design and build quality its just gorgeous , and for more mine is jailbroken on iOS 6 :)
ZONEofTECH This quite a pointless comparison with the only difference being IOS 7 instead of IOS 6. We all know the iPhone 5C beats the 4S quite comfortably in every speed test this guy did. Personally I would get the 5S.. I have a 4S currently and its beginning to show its age since the IOS 7.0.4 update.
ZONEofTECH I meant backplate and the 5c is plastic thats just weak
ZONEofTECH You mist have the bad iphone 4s, my was set up under the 25 seconds...
ZONEofTECH My 4s is really fast so I dont care about the 5c
ZONEofTECH you should do downloading app between 5c and 5s
ZONEofTECH So does that mean i can talk faster on iPhone 5C?
ZONEofTECH I love my iPhone 5c its the best, FYI the iPhone 4S brakes more easily since its all glass and the 5c is plastic so its a little bit more durable.
ZONEofTECH isnt a fair test! put ios 6 on iphone 4s, and test again! ios 7 is rubish!
ZONEofTECH I know this has nothing to do with the video, but seriously dude, you are quite a handsome dudep
ZONEofTECH my 4s started in 19 seconds?
ZONEofTECH New iOS 7.0.3, 7.0.2 Jailbreak Supported, W W W . iPhone5Break . C O M
ZONEofTECH my phone contact will be up next month and the 5C will be replacing my 4
ZONEofTECH He looks exactly like Andrew garfield.LETS ALL CALL HIM SPIDERMAN INSTEAD.SPIDERMAN REVIEWS OR COMPARES IPHONE 4s TO 5c
ZONEofTECH Nice video  I luv the music in Boot time test can u reply what it is? :)
ZONEofTECH also you have over 5000 mail on 4s and none on 5c
ZONEofTECH Um excuse the iphone5c red is pink did you notice that

ZONEofTECH iPhone 5S  5C launch!Apple store september 20th!
ZONEofTECH You look like Andrew Garfield.
ZONEofTECH How did you get the Touch ID app? Normally it isnt an app

ZONEofTECH Really good video, by the way. What Apple Store is this?
ZONEofTECH cant wait to get my 5s a gold one (
ZONEofTECH The iPhone 5c blue and green look vey nice
ZONEofTECH I think that they used too much gold models on the display floor
ZONEofTECH Cant wait to get my iphone 5s :):):)
ZONEofTECH Out of stock at 8.45 whilst open at 9 XD
ZONEofTECH What did I just see! They were using iPads as labels for the new phones!!! (Ive never been inside a apple store so this is new for me)
ZONEofTECH I would love the IPhone 5c
ZONEofTECH the white one looks best
ZONEofTECH wait did someone win the 5c
ZONEofTECH I would just love that iPhone 5c I cant stop thinking about it
ZONEofTECH Yeah..they gave them earlier...
ZONEofTECH Yeah man this site is just giving out comletely free Pink Apple new iPads for today only. But you do have to be fill out your email id but it is legit, I claimed mine just before. Better hurry up! UPAD3.COM A chill penetrating wail of outrage screamed up from the depts of the Abyss. So loud and horrifying was it that all the citizens of Palanthas woke shruddering from even the deepest slee
ZONEofTECH I got a pink iPhone 5C!!! lucky me!!!
ZONEofTECH The front facing camera on the 5c is better than the one on the 5.
ZONEofTECH its actually not the first reversible cable. there is other cables out there that can go in 360 degrees. like the one that goes into the samsung chromebook
ZONEofTECH If anyones interested, heres an iPhone 5C unboxing I did with one of my music tracks called Sun Beam http:youtu.beuz7uDCyrGD8
ZONEofTECH ya know the sleek design makes me think of the early 1900s cars and their colors
ZONEofTECH the language at the start screen you didnt know was Japanese because i am learning it!
ZONEofTECH BLACK AND GREEN IS AWESOME
ZONEofTECH Hallo is Dutch. :) I think the one you didnt know too was Korean! Nice first look!
ZONEofTECH I never understood the price gouging on extra storage. Like 100 for an extra 16 gigs internally while for 15 I got a 32 gb micro sd card with adapter. Same gripe on the nonstandard expensive cables...just why?And for the price of the 5c version, they could have used a colored aluminum.
ZONEofTECH I love that phone, but I love more you :3 u r to cute 3
ZONEofTECH Is it possible to take a long picture in a way..?
ZONEofTECH I Got iPhone 5c Green
ZONEofTECH 5C is the worst Iphone model yet. Do not buy it. You are wasting a upgrade.

ZONEofTECH Whats with the Display ? Full HD ?
ZONEofTECH David Gibradze yeah 4GLTE.
ZONEofTECH Considering the size of many phones, this isnt a huge display, its a larger than iPhone, but still smallmedium screen 4.5. Huge is the Sony Z ultra which is 6.4 inch ish.. so yeah
ZONEofTECH The 32gb model comes only in black?? I want the 32gb, but I find the black model not so attractive...
ZONEofTECH Thahahah If your racist then you dont like black for some reason hahahahahaha
ZONEofTECH A best phone review i ever saw. Thanks!!
ZONEofTECH you look like amazing spiderman by the way
ZONEofTECH I was waiting for him to drop a phone at 12:00 with the way he was shuffling them around..
ZONEofTECH Ofcourse.......NOT ! Thats what She said xD
ZONEofTECH Its not the number of cores that matter. However, the Lumia 925 is far behind the S4 in term of performance. Animation on WP can be smoother, but thats it. Gaming on the 925 is not as good even though it has a 720p (vs 1080p on the S4). App launching is not as fast as on the S4 either.:)
ZONEofTECH Which languages are available on phone? Thanks
ZONEofTECH Dude you look like Andrew Garfield!
ZONEofTECH dude u are are awsome!! ur explanations are sooo cool n helpfulll :)
ZONEofTECH You are pretty good making reviews!!

I just hope that 32gb will be available in Ph. Nice review. Good job.

Dont hear too much of reviews and others. You like it, buy it.....simple. Life is simple. Dont make it hard on yourself. Apple, Samsung, Sony and others are all great technological entities. Take care. Merry Christmas All.
ZONEofTECH I want a blue iphone 5C, have a really old phone!
ZONEofTECH Why are you so damn hot huh I hate you haha.
ZONEofTECH I would really like iphone 5c :D
ZONEofTECH Awesome I want one so much
ZONEofTECH Working on them now, sorry for the delay. They should be up in no more than 30min, Thank you for your patience! Daniel ZONEofTECH
ZONEofTECH Iphone 5C (Red) it would be the greatest prize ever.!
ZONEofTECH Follow me on Instagram ITZMIKEE
ZONEofTECH Prfftttt...i cant breath from
ZONEofTECH Its 40X the original iPhone
ZONEofTECH nice video dude i think you did the best recap video
ZONEofTECH email me at rummanhussain6gmail.com to teach me how to get iphone 4s for free please reply!
ZONEofTECH The 5c is the same as the 5 but in a plastic shell...
ZONEofTECH iPhone 5c is my best Apple device.
ZONEofTECH Yes, I actually covered this in my Samsung Galaxy S4 videos. If you want, feel free to check that out as well :)
ZONEofTECH Thx Jake :) Im giving one away! The giveaway video is up! Good luck :) Who knows? You might not even have to get one for Christmas :)
ZONEofTECH You should do more research BEFORE trolling like this. I didnt swear you! Its clear that you have nothing else in your head besides a peasized brain. Im sorry I wasted 5min of my time trying to be nice and reply to a person with a 1 digit IQ.
ZONEofTECH Iphone 5s is still not touching the Galaxy S4.
ZONEofTECH Thank you for doing a quick overview of the 2013 Apple event. Good to see some product innovation again and a cheaper version as well that still has good product features. I am still interested to see if a 6 inch version comes out.
ZONEofTECH The 5c a Jewish version of the iPhone
ZONEofTECH I kinda like the 5C, would consider buying it although Id love the 5S, but may be outta my price range. the specs for the C were better than i was even owing. The white 5C would be the only one Id consider though not so keen on the colors. Thanks for the video man, good work )
ZONEofTECH Lol!!! 56x faster THAN ORIGINAL IPHONE!!! That is iPhone 1, not 56x faster than iPhone 5...
ZONEofTECH TaaastyBurger Hand gestures, air swipe, eye stroll, just to name a few Is what the s4 does.
ZONEofTECH The Cell processor is single core with 6 SPEs. They act behave like CPU cores but in fact theyre not. Theys just CPU processes, thats what they are. Anyway, the GPU is the one that matters in gaming, not the CPU. The A5Xs GPU is 3x more powerful than the PS3s 550 MHz NVIDIASCEI RSX Reality Synthesizer. Conversation ENDED.
ZONEofTECH i would like to get the new iPhone 5c for free just because there is a good guy who wants to give away one
ZONEofTECH 56!!!! SERIOUSLY?!?! HAHA
ZONEofTECH :D EPIC THANK YOU to my EPIC FAN! Thx again Mahmoud! :) Daniel ZONEofTECH
ZONEofTECH Hey great video man but those figures that say 40X and 56X are the improvements it has had since the original iPhone .. Just a heads up!
ZONEofTECH I REALLY enjoyed this video. Thank you for going through all the features. Im hoping to maybe get the iphone 5c for Christmas!!!
ZONEofTECH iphone 8 will release in septmeber 2018.
ZONEofTECH Great video man like all of them! Got all the info for the upcoming iphone ) Detailed and informative! I subscribed to you and shared your channel :D
ZONEofTECH Thx :) I do hope so. I wanted to be as detailed as possible. Unfortunately I dont have that many views at the moment :( , so a share and like would greatly be appreciated :) Cheers! Dan ZONEofTECH
ZONEofTECH What does the Galaxy S4 do? Serious question.
ZONEofTECH I want the new I phone 5s or 5c
ZONEofTECH same shit diff toilet. new processor, dual flash and touch ID. yeah thats worth hundereds of dollars. Sticking with my 5 until iphone 8
ZONEofTECH Sir Color Blue Thanks :))
ZONEofTECH Whats the ending song?
ZONEofTECH Nice video dude! Like all of them daniel
ZONEofTECH Well.. Im kindda interested now on iphone because i was an android user for how many years now.. Its great but i just want something for change and hopefully if i upgraded or change my fone to iphone hopefully i wontt be dissappointed.. Thanks for the summary of the apple event.. More power!!
ZONEofTECH You look like Andrew Garfield!
ZONEofTECH i like your videos man ! subscribed :D
ZONEofTECH what do yall think iphone 5s or iphone 5c
ZONEofTECH I did add an annotation over the video, to correct that.
ZONEofTECH 7:17 Dont mean any offense, (not much knowledge on the topic either) but this iHealth would be very neat. But what they had shown on the screen was the Nike iPod App.
ZONEofTECH JUST GIVE ME THE FUCKING KEYNOTE YOU FUCKING CUNT!!
ZONEofTECH Go back to the 1950s old man! Any nonparinoid person would buy one.
ZONEofTECH ZoneofTech my bad.. I always turn off annotations so I missed that
ZONEofTECH And it has a special feature. Basically your personal NSA agent can see more and spy on you better than ever on the iPhone 5s sooo what r you waiting for go and buy it just because apple says so :)
ZONEofTECH i cant wait to get the green iphone 5c
ZONEofTECH Thanks for summing everything up right here. I didnt want to watch an apple event for over an hour!
ZONEofTECH gamesradar(dot)comnewlyannouncedipad3maybemorepowerfulps3and360willitreallymattergaming Heres a link :) If you want Ill even find Apples keynote in which they say this. Keep in mind that the PS3 has 2006 hardware which is nowhere near the devices we have today. The thing with the PS3 is that the games are extremely optimised, thats why they look so amazing on such weak hardware. If I have time Ill try and make a video explaining this in more detail. Cheers Anthony!
ZONEofTECH Yes, Apple is going to have an event on September the 10th. I will be doing a FULL coverage of that even. And as soon as the iPhone 5S, 5C and iPad 5 come out, I will do every single possible video of them, from Reviews to Comparisons to previous models and YES! even GIVEAWAYS! I will most probably do an iPhone 5C giveaway so stay tune for that! Cheers Devan!
ZONEofTECH This cant be released soon enough.
ZONEofTECH This better than stupid apple
ZONEofTECH Number one again. I love Samsung :)
ZONEofTECH His 2nd Sex tape!!! Orrr It could be the Note 10.1 2014 edition...I dont know...The sex tape option seems more legit! Thumbs up if you agree!
ZONEofTECH What do you expect? Hes korean and his native language is not english.
ZONEofTECH What is the one more thing??????
ZONEofTECH hammizin arvadin sikim
ZONEofTECH What is the one more thing??????
ZONEofTECH He says galax, he isnt pronouncing his own prodcut well. Its GALAXY, with Y in the end Mr.Kim.
ZONEofTECH I do try to reply to as many questions as I can, especially to people like you, who only ask serious and important questions. I really hate it when I work 10h for a video, especially when I am in the middle of nowhere and work my as.s to find a McDonalds to upload a video, and that video still gets more dislikes than likes, simply because people did not read the title. I believe you know which video I am talking about. :(
ZONEofTECH note 3 looks like galaxy s2 , nice
ZONEofTECH what about apple ! anything soon .
ZONEofTECH when will you announce the winner of the iPhone 5C. and when you do can you message me back telling who the winner is thank you for your time
ZONEofTECH yeah i know what video you are talking about ..people dont appreciate the effort and they think the video was about another thing . but anyway you have alot of fans ..cheer up:)))
ZONEofTECH Yes, Apple is going to have an event on September the 10th. I will be doing a FULL coverage of that even. And as soon as the iPhone 5S, 5C and iPad 5 come out, I will do every single possible video of them, from Reviews to Comparisons to previous models and YES! even GIVEAWAYS! I will most probably do an iPhone 5C giveaway so stay tune for that! Cheers again Mr. White!
ZONEofTECH funny video and a cool video at the same time ! hahahahaha
ZONEofTECH funny video and a cool video at the same time !
ZONEofTECH I love it how people CANT read the title and spam the dislike button.... READ THE TITLE: This is the event announcement....NOT the event...Jesus...
ZONEofTECH funny video and a cool video at the same time ! hahaha
ZONEofTECH First time commenting on ur vid u do good video and its a great phone
ZONEofTECH I wasnt taking to you, I was talking to Mr Android is Poopoo over there.
ZONEofTECH Mines the 17th now :D
ZONEofTECH Lisa Mitchel  Neopolitan Dreams (Dubstep Remix)  Non Copyrighted Dubstep :) There you go Mr. White!
ZONEofTECH nope, and stop insulting 7 year olds
ZONEofTECH Mate, now im gonna rape you in your sleep.
ZONEofTECH iphone 5S5 speed iphone 5c5 crap
ZONEofTECH Hey man! :D Thanks for another great video. :)
ZONEofTECH huh, sooo htc one is plastic? research before you comment...if you can...
ZONEofTECH I was very lucky to get an iphone5s gold because i was the last person to get it before it was sold out
ZONEofTECH The phone isnt even out and youre already hating. Well thats quite pathetic.
ZONEofTECH Android is fucking poopoo.
ZONEofTECH Thats awesome! :D Well if you have enjoyed this video, I have a lot more videos like this one coming soon :) So be sure to like it and Subscribe to my channel for more epicness! :) Cheers Ella! Dan
ZONEofTECH True that, hopefully Tim Cook can have at least a slight touch of Steves influenced on Apple.
ZONEofTECH First person to tell me that Im older than I actually am! hahah :D By the way, English isnt even my 1st language. Im Romanian :)
ZONEofTECH Hey Petr! Thanks for another great comment! :D
ZONEofTECH Nope. iPhone 5 Shit and iPhone 5 Crap
ZONEofTECH In that case, still better than shit  crap.
ZONEofTECH How old do I look to you? :D 15 or 17 hahaha :)) ?
ZONEofTECH i think you need severe medical help, you have several mental disorders including neurological deficit(reducing your ability to complete simple tasks such as spell words) and Histrionic Personality Disorder (causing you to overreact). i apologise for my delay in replying as i had to study for several weeks the symptoms you portrayed in you comments to figure out your physical illnesses. Get well soon my friend!!!
ZONEofTECH Mate, ill rip your head off. I swear on me mum.
ZONEofTECH Haha, that must be why :D Fandroids are so ridiculous .
ZONEofTECH Its an Android fangirlboy, who doesnt realize the quality of Apple phones with their metal casing compared to Androids cheap plastic casing.
ZONEofTECH just pass your nursery exams and youll be fine. dont worry! no need to cry
ZONEofTECH Still the same garbage
ZONEofTECH android is actually pretty nice, i prefer iOS but android is pretty darn spiffy in the higher end phones
ZONEofTECH The name of the song in the end ?
ZONEofTECH It took you a whole month to write that? Hahaha. Homo.
ZONEofTECH Android is poopoo, get it through your head.
ZONEofTECH No, its his twin brother! :)
ZONEofTECH Nice video cant wait for the ipod touch 6g
ZONEofTECH I would like to say to people who want iOS 7 it is semi available to developers and those who know how to update with downloaded firmware. But it will hopefully be released soon but the current beta is less glitchy on the 4S in my opinion
ZONEofTECH I wish ios7 will be out on 10th September
ZONEofTECH Usually at least one week before the rumoured event. So my guess would be September the 3rd.
ZONEofTECH Andrew garfield is that you?
ZONEofTECH was spamt ihr dummen kinder hier rum ? ich wollte mir die Keynote anschaun und nicht irgentwelche Fratzen....
ZONEofTECH first like view and comment
ZONEofTECH When do you think apple will confirm this?
ZONEofTECH Nokia is just jealous that samsung and apple is better
ZONEofTECH I Have a ,Samsung But I am thinking iPhone
ZONEofTECH Hahah, yeah I know. Cheers Mr. White!
ZONEofTECH The final part Mr Bean dance is hilarious .and awesome Nokia commercial :)
ZONEofTECH Traded my 4s for an s4
ZONEofTECH Yup this website here is just sending out comletely free White Apple new iPads for today only. You have to be fill out your email id but it is legit, I claimed my one a few minutes ago. Get in quick! UPAD3.COM Fuck, she was so sick of herselfherself and her fucking emotional retardation. How did people do this shit all the time, this wanting people, caring about them? How did they stand i
ZONEofTECH Windows Phone i love you!
ZONEofTECH Hahahah that was a good commercial, but Ill never switch my iPhone!
ZONEofTECH I use an lg optimus l9. Android for life!
ZONEofTECH mr.bean dancing bombastic from shaggy is realy fucking funny XDDDDD
ZONEofTECH Im having an LG Optimus L9 right now. But I think I will switch to a Nokia Lumia by next year.
ZONEofTECH Im have a samsung galaxy S4 and an ipad Samsung and appple rule Nokia suck
ZONEofTECH Nokia fucking rules again! the Lumia series is so cool!
ZONEofTECH are companies allowed to go at each other like that ? isnt that unprofessional ?
ZONEofTECH I think samsung and apple should team up there making fun of apple and samsung
ZONEofTECH I have a stupid iphone5 but Im getting gs4
ZONEofTECH NOKIA phone and commercial annihilate the competition.The king has returned.
ZONEofTECH I have an iphone 4 and I love these new windows phone commercials
ZONEofTECH Whats the name of they song playing
ZONEofTECH what do i think? I think its gonna cost me my entire salary for 5 years
ZONEofTECH First it was good but they over emphasized that it was round
ZONEofTECH How is this the same? First of all we dont know the price yet. Secondly, the Mac Pro is all about performance, and this thing runs circles around the old one. Lastly, the 6 thunderbolt 2.0 ports allow for unheard of expansion in capabilities. So whats with the same shit?
ZONEofTECH The same shit and more expensive thats the main difference
ZONEofTECH I saw it first at the movie Jobs
ZONEofTECH Cheap my ass i love it
ZONEofTECH Unbox iPhone 5c !!! (white color)
ZONEofTECH Dont really care about iPhones
ZONEofTECH I just added the tenth comment because I felt like it :)
ZONEofTECH I guess you guys cant speak Chinese
ZONEofTECH Its cheap but apple never makes bad quality stuff. The plastic back doesnt even really feel like plasstic and for 100 its a great price
ZONEofTECH Yes upload the unboxing of Iphone 5c
ZONEofTECH scratch it with a real diamond and see how well it holds out
ZONEofTECH by the looks of the video quality it was recorded by the iPhone 5c....
ZONEofTECH YOU ARE AWESOME ZONE OF TECH!!!!. Thanks for updating us about the apple products.
ZONEofTECH Epic Shirt Change lol
ZONEofTECH in my country this cell phone cost 1100 dolars
ZONEofTECH if you live in a different country its not dollars.
ZONEofTECH Yeah, I know. :D You know that saying: Better late than never, or something like that. :D
ZONEofTECH plz let me win because me cousin is braggin about her iphone 4s so i want a iphone 5 to rub it in her face
ZONEofTECH Can i have the headphones!?!?!?
ZONEofTECH And you deserve my like :)
ZONEofTECH What the hell? It came out like a year ago
ZONEofTECH Breaking bad and dexter ..man you deserve the subscribe (Y)
ZONEofTECH The ps4 is better than the fucking xbox one Xbox onetrash
ZONEofTECH Currently: PS3. Im sticking with it instead of paying an annual online fee for PS4 or Xbox One.
ZONEofTECH Im getting Xbox I love it Im a Xbox person
ZONEofTECH y dont u unbox it urself
ZONEofTECH im a Pc Gamer ... But the xbox could chanche that :)
ZONEofTECH GUYS I think ive found captain sparkerkelz long lost brother from another mother
ZONEofTECH Holy shit a 100 dollar sticker
ZONEofTECH get the ps4 I love sony
ZONEofTECH Xbox one  trash ps4 all the way playstation nation
ZONEofTECH Thats so amazing that sticker looks so amazing
ZONEofTECH Thus guy looks gay at the very beginnings
ZONEofTECH Ill end up getting both in the end
ZONEofTECH I have an playstation and an xbox at home
ZONEofTECH im gonna get a ps4 and the sensor
ZONEofTECH Only Xbox has the recycled laptop chargers for power supplies. Only Xbox.
ZONEofTECH Maybe both :P Im the kind of guy that isnt obsessed with the console but for games :)
ZONEofTECH Hahah, yeah..YOU GOT ME! (W.W)
ZONEofTECH this guy is clearly over excited for no reason xbox onetrash
ZONEofTECH im all nintendo so the new member to the ds family the 2ds
ZONEofTECH You mean Ouya station 4.
ZONEofTECH Fake Thats Not a Xbox On Thats The PS3
ZONEofTECH He was going to put it down with the back foward
ZONEofTECH Who cares? Im still buying the PS4! Haha, awesome video!
ZONEofTECH Im gonna get a PS4 but in mid 2014 or later cause I have a barely new PS3 and I dont like buying tech stuff as soon as they arrive cause sometimes they have software problems.. btw great videos bro keep it up!
ZONEofTECH You look like CaptainSparklez )
ZONEofTECH You look like The Amazing Spiderman :O
ZONEofTECH Eu teas sfatui sa mergi pe PS4. Playstation  e doar 50 pe an, deci nu poti sa zici ca e o cheltuiala foarte mare. Gandestete cum te vei simti cand vei cumpara Battlefield 4, stiind ca exista o varianta la acelasi pret, cu grafica de 10000x de ori mai buna, pentru PS4. :) Cheers!
ZONEofTECH Theres not really one I prefer
ZONEofTECH Actually, I believe I was the 1st one to see the video )) Cheers Vakaris and congrats!
ZONEofTECH Still a giant brick for power supply, I want both
ZONEofTECH Whats the song called where he testing the camera
ZONEofTECH how to turn on manual focus?
ZONEofTECH when u unboxed ur s4 did plastic come on the back cover
ZONEofTECH NICE, at last i ve managed to find a professional camera preview, 10X.
ZONEofTECH Andrew garfield, is that you?
ZONEofTECH you look like the new spiderman
ZONEofTECH I like the Samsung Galaxy s4 camera better than the iphone 4s.
ZONEofTECH When I take a picture with a highlight out the sun, it turns everything dark to try to reduce light. Is there a way to stop that.
ZONEofTECH The camera is the only thing that apple hasnt developed yet that is good
ZONEofTECH Great video , thanks just wondering what is the base band version of ur GS4
ZONEofTECH 4th viewer! 2nd comment!!!! 4th viewer?? wait...waht?
ZONEofTECH 3rd Viewer! 1st Commet. Just bought the s4 the other day
ZONEofTECH I do have the galaxy s4 i9500 and i love everything about the camera except 3 things (1. Video recording stabilization 2. Noisy voice when recording video 3. Slowing auto focus)
ZONEofTECH GREAT video! I rarelly post coments to videos. Congratulations. I love the S4. Great photos for a smartphone. A lesson that Apple should learn...
ZONEofTECH Thx Sam :) I worked really hard on this video!
ZONEofTECH Great is such a great video nice work
ZONEofTECH Its all legit because I have a iPad Air and its all the same...
ZONEofTECH hi ... I got I question ..hmm so the ipad 5 is coming out or not ?
ZONEofTECH I have multiple ways of doing that. Maybe Ill make a video  tomorrow if Im not too lazy :)
ZONEofTECH Ermpghh! Thanks man! Thanks for commenting!
ZONEofTECH Haha, you got tired of the S4 videos?
ZONEofTECH Thats shit if they start doing this bullshit plastic Id rather switch to samsung fuck apple royally if they do this cheap shit...
ZONEofTECH Now these are the kind of videos, I like! Awesome video man keep up the good work!
ZONEofTECH Yeah ...I know...it does suck. But there will most likely be workarounds on how to get iOS 7 on the iPod Touch 4th gen. If that is the case then I will definitely do a tutorial video showing you how to do that.
ZONEofTECH Tbh I hate the fact that they dont jae ios 7 on the iPod touch 4g
ZONEofTECH The iPhone 5C isnt made of cheap plastic its made of polycarbonate which is not cheap.
ZONEofTECH They would sell this plastic iPhone, alongside the iPhone 5  5S. So they wont switch to plastic entirely. Only the cheaper iPhone 5C will be made out of plastic.
ZONEofTECH This is kinda fake cause if it is a new iPhone it should have ios7 not the ios6 thats obvious
ZONEofTECH Funny when jobs was around if this is all true off course this never would have happened.he would have had the heads of the ones responsible for the leak and had them displayed at Apple headquarters for all to see. It just isnt the same without him around Apple has lost control of itself again.
ZONEofTECH I fond it kinda good cause we will be able to buy I phone at a cheaper price
ZONEofTECH Who said anything about iOS 6? It is going to have iOS 7.
ZONEofTECH In a way. Those videos were awesome but Im sitting here with my iPhone 4 looking for a way to control my computer with an iPhone. Haha.
ZONEofTECH i want the iphone 5c more than 5s honstly
ZONEofTECH Thanks for the great tip
ZONEofTECH What about the note 3...? Any cool features on this phone.
ZONEofTECH Which background are u using???
ZONEofTECH What software that you use to edit your video and how you upload a lot of video on youtube(it will take a lot of time :( )?
ZONEofTECH I love your videos, but please post more tutorials and videos not related to the Galaxy S4!
ZONEofTECH u should case tests that would be really cool
ZONEofTECH What sort of videos would you like to see? :)
ZONEofTECH I use FinalCut Pro X and Photoshop for the thumbnails if that counts. I spend around 48h on each video. Uploading one doesnt take that long, it takes around 30min with the internet I have here.
ZONEofTECH Yeah, I truly am pretty active. I have a huge list of videos I need to finish, before reviewing the iPhone 5 and iPad Mini (which I havent shown you yet). Too bad I do not have a strong community yet :(
ZONEofTECH Dode Dont ask us what we need to see, We want you to show us something we dont know )
ZONEofTECH I think they should come out with a new nexus 4, or possible a nexus 5. I would love the big screen. It would basically be a cheaper google play edition galaxy s4
ZONEofTECH I love to be the first to comment. Cool video
ZONEofTECH Awsome video man and review the Nexus 7:)
ZONEofTECH whats your favorite smartphone of 2013?? s4 , htc one, iphone,etc...??and, nice videos!!
ZONEofTECH Any way to do this with YouTube?
ZONEofTECH Mine doesnt do that anymore. Please help):
ZONEofTECH Yes, it does work on the S3 as well as the S3 Mini and the S4 Mini. Not to mention the Notes :)
ZONEofTECH I did the first like and the first comment. I love your videos
ZONEofTECH say we dont want to have it doing exactly the same thing is there a way to use it seperatly?
ZONEofTECH Great video. Definitely subscribed!
ZONEofTECH everytime I try to connect my macbook air with the tv it says The Arrangement tab of Displays preferences is hidden because you only have a single display attached to this computer what should i do?
ZONEofTECH works for my 6 foot HDMI cord but not through my 50 foot HDMI cord. Suggestions?
ZONEofTECH Liked it, thanks for the tip. I would like your input on setting up multi monitor with macbook.Using macbook pro late 2012. Upgrading to 16gb ram and ssd drive
ZONEofTECH how do you make the intro
ZONEofTECH I have a MacBook Air, 13, mid2011
ZONEofTECH dude you look like Andrew Garfield :) cheers.
ZONEofTECH In what way have I overused myself? Was the intro too long or the ending?
ZONEofTECH The intro is too long
ZONEofTECH Anything with an HDMI port is going to work.
ZONEofTECH when doing this, say if my moniter is larger than my laptop screen and im using word, does the monitor have the ability to show more or the word document, or is it just expanded and blown up to fit the screen?
ZONEofTECH this isnt working for me?
ZONEofTECH Cool! Youre welcome :) What kind of monitor do you have atm?
ZONEofTECH thanks a lot, really i need connect my macbook pro to big display monitor i feel frustration when i try to work on logic pro
ZONEofTECH actually i didnt buy any one yet, i still waiting recommendation i know that Apple Display is the better choice but i live in Morocco and i couldnt find it here, yes there are many Monitors like Dell Samsung and others, but unfortunately there arent Apple Monitors maybe because apple doesnt have a store in morocco yet, so what kind of monitors can you recommend, thanks again  im so sorry about my bad English :)
ZONEofTECH Awesome video, but you sorta overused yourself in the video. Even though its awesome to finally know who you are, please just show the regular intro. Other than that, AMAZING!
ZONEofTECH does it transfer the audio to the tv too?
ZONEofTECH can you use more than one tv(s) for multiple displays?
ZONEofTECH It works for me but the audio doesnt any suggestions
ZONEofTECH The SD card was around 30 or 20.
ZONEofTECH The camera was 450 or 700. I did an unboxing video for the camera, check it out: watch?vVRgstRKelsE
ZONEofTECH how much does it cost?
ZONEofTECH you are from romania ? and you bought the camera from emag ?
ZONEofTECH I just had to ask cause a lot of people who do unboxings, will do video game unboxings as well
ZONEofTECH i meant the camera not sd card, i liked it
ZONEofTECH Hey Just, Yes, I am still thinking whether or not to buy a console or to build a hardcore gaming PC. If Ill be getting a console I will definitely do an unboxing video, a review video and a LOT of gaming videos :) So stay tune for that :D
ZONEofTECH provide a link to where you get your products in your discriptionthanks for gr8 vids
ZONEofTECH Hey its me again and sup
ZONEofTECH did anyone see the girl in the background
ZONEofTECH 4th good job reviewing
ZONEofTECH Unboxing begins at 11:00... huehue
ZONEofTECH where did you buy this? please answer me because i am planning to buy this camera but i live in Greece and we have here 220v so if i am correct i saw a plug in which is for 220v? Am i right? Please answer me man i really need your help.
ZONEofTECH BLAH BLA BLAH....BLAH...BLAH BLAH......TOO MUCH OF STUPIDITY SAY THINGS THAT HAVE MEANING AND BE SERIOUS..YOU ARE ACTING LIKE AN IMMATURE KID
ZONEofTECH Too much bla bla bla.... But its ok
ZONEofTECH thats what she said hahahahah
ZONEofTECH did it end up working on windows 8?
ZONEofTECH I like your videos but OMG 600D
ZONEofTECH I want to win the ball!
ZONEofTECH :D thats awesome. For some reason, out of almost 9000 subscribers, less than 50 watch my videos on a regular base...which is really discouraging.
ZONEofTECH I have seen most of them abd i found out about you late last year and ive watched every video since i subscribed :)
ZONEofTECH You kept saying 60D lol
ZONEofTECH Keep it up :) i love your content especially iOS 7 videos
ZONEofTECH Little bit to long! But i enjoyed
ZONEofTECH :D Thx Batman! I bet you only subscribed because of my Batman voice :))
ZONEofTECH Give me the football lol
ZONEofTECH Little bit too long! But i enjoy it!
ZONEofTECH View, Like and Sub! Im waiting for more Vids )
ZONEofTECH Id like the football, please c:
ZONEofTECH can i have the football? Please?
ZONEofTECH u dont sound like batman u sound like bob from bobs burgers
ZONEofTECH 9000 subscribers and 16 views for a video :( Makes me want to quit.
ZONEofTECH Haha :D Of course...and because my 600D will arrive tomorrow )
ZONEofTECH I would love to win the ball please . Ur vids are awsome. Subbed :)
ZONEofTECH zone tech you made a 16 minute video and took the camera out at 13 minutes. what you should have done is do a 3  4 min unboxing then in another video did a review of 10 mins. Im thinking of starting a youtube channel so i came across yours just because your using a 600d Im thinking of getting one. how iswas it? also brilliant that you got so many subscribers and you where using a iPhone and iPad to make your videos. hats off to you!
ZONEofTECH Wei wer wie der Song heit?
ZONEofTECH Soll ich das Video jetzt auf Twitter stellen!!!
ZONEofTECH im geting that phone for birthday
ZONEofTECH What would happen if you played a recording that said pause? Would the music stop?
ZONEofTECH :D I havent tried it. But I will :D Amazing ideea!!!
ZONEofTECH please make a video about scrolling up and down by tilting the device or eyes, because i couldnt do it.
ZONEofTECH This isnt only on the s4, its the same that the s3
ZONEofTECH I have the Note 3 and my shit never ever works. Been in the tutorial it never works. Glad it just isnt me.
ZONEofTECH Do phones cost more in Romania or the US
ZONEofTECH I know that. The S3 Mini had it as well but Samsung removed it in a software update. Anyway, did I say in the video that only the S4 has this feature?
ZONEofTECH Theres no way that thats an actually Apple product. It look just like a custom casing for an iPhone 5 some company came up with.
ZONEofTECH in the video...its just an iphone 5 with white hardcase
ZONEofTECH Look exactly as Nokia Lumia. Haha. Trololo
ZONEofTECH Arruinaron el iphone con el video de hasta el final
ZONEofTECH the translucent case looks awesome i want it too
ZONEofTECH 1:90 DUTCH look at THE date
ZONEofTECH These pictures look like an iPod touch with a white case on it
ZONEofTECH Ipod touch with earpiece
ZONEofTECH They should stay with the metallic features the plastic and translucent iPhone make it look cheap and too fragile
ZONEofTECH I actually kinda want it.
ZONEofTECH No, it doesnt. The plastic is good quality. It makes it look kind of futuristic.
ZONEofTECH Kinda :) but with a plastic back instead of an aluminium back. And thinker....way thicker (thats what she said!!!!)
ZONEofTECH no, it has a few different components including a larger battery
ZONEofTECH Will there also be a more regular iPhone 5s or 6?? Or will there just be lower costing iPhones made of plastic? Or is that unknown?
ZONEofTECH how much dollars with it cost?
ZONEofTECH So I can get the cheap version and replace the shell with the current iPhone 5 shell?
ZONEofTECH All it is is basically the iPhone 3Gs revamped
ZONEofTECH Theres gonna be a regular 5s, the successor to the 5, and maybe the plastic version if apple is actually working on one.
ZONEofTECH Once this gets released, I might get my hands on one, review it and then give it away to a lucky viewer. Like this comment if you would like an iPhone Plastic GIVEAWAY, once it gets released!
ZONEofTECH for me the plastic iphone looks better
ZONEofTECH It looks like shit who will buy it. I would rather give 1000 euros for an iphone 5s than that shit ps im 11 and i have an iphone 5 and i will never get that piece of shit
ZONEofTECH FAKE and GAY!!!! TROLL ALERT!
ZONEofTECH Is this option on the mini
ZONEofTECH Can you change your remote cus i had a Philips and now i got Sony how do i change the remote please answer :)
ZONEofTECH Hmm, not that far away to be honest. Ukraine is the only country separating us (that sounded really weird hahha). Im glad you like my videos! Dont forget to like,share (all that good stuff....) and SUBSCRIBE to my channel for more EPIC videos ! :D
ZONEofTECH Let me guess, you installed it on an iPhone 4. Am I right? :)
ZONEofTECH How far away is Romania from Belarus I live in NY now but good videos
ZONEofTECH the one with a hairy chest
ZONEofTECH There were a few lagging points but other than that it was perfect.
ZONEofTECH Lagging or lacking points? And what do you mean by perfect? The video or the graphics benchmark test?
ZONEofTECH 26310 with Cyanogenmod 10.1 But ot doesnt really matter at all.
ZONEofTECH apple rock its a great one you should try it its relaible especially with a 80 megapixel camera so ha suck a dick idiot!!!

ZONEofTECH I manually installed ios7 beta 1 , and when I do a software update it says , your on the latest version ? Please help ? How do I update to beta 2 and 3
ZONEofTECH No, simply go to SettingsGeneralSoftware update and it will find and install iOS 7 beta 3 automatically. Its exactly the same process as the Beta 1Beta 2 upgrade. :)
ZONEofTECH It downloads a Dgm file. what do i do with this please help now :(
ZONEofTECH Can I get iOS 7 beta 3 from a windows computer, guys ?
ZONEofTECH what if the first 2 betas wouldnt install on iphone 4s. Like I shiftUpdate and it verifies with apple server but then during the preparing iphone for software update it reboots to recovery mode and reboots yet again to a blank screen?
ZONEofTECH is this working in ipod 2g? help plsssss
ZONEofTECH I love this iOS 7 Beta 3 :D Got it from this amazing site .kappleos7.om Get yours now!
ZONEofTECH Wallpaper on screen ?
ZONEofTECH I have installed iOS 7 on an iPhone 5
ZONEofTECH Zone of tech. Do you have apple tv because i just got one and dont know how to hook up like airplay with it. And do all the mirroring stuff with ios 7(iphone 4s) Thanks!!
ZONEofTECH im back to 6.1.3, yup it laggs on the 4S not that much but yeah and crashes, one time it went dead, i couldnt do anything and i got scared, i just plugged it to charge it, and it started right away i started the downgrade to 6.1.3 OO, will wait for the final and official version......
ZONEofTECH I was just about to say this to. But not in this nice of a way if you know what I mean.
ZONEofTECH No thanks I like android sometimes it has lag but still like android
ZONEofTECH Yeah I know.... Anyway, my iPhone usually restarts like every 2h or so. Besides the restart, apps crash extremely often (although for some reason, I wasnt able to show that in the video). This is indeed, just the BETA. The finally version should be buttery smooth.
ZONEofTECH Omg quit complaining its a damn beta
ZONEofTECH No screen recorders work with it
ZONEofTECH its possible. just do the same way like you did when upgrading to 7.0
ZONEofTECH Everything was false in this sentence. For Youre Welcome you say Gerngeschehen. :)
ZONEofTECH I honestly think iPod touch 4g shouldve had ios7 since the iPhone4 has it and they both have the a4 chip.
ZONEofTECH You really are too harsh on it. This really is NO lag when you opened calculator its like you judging saying its bad when its in BETA 1. Compare it to an android and see the difference.
ZONEofTECH :) Once again, off camera it actually lags pretty bad. But then again, I am a perfectionist and want everything to be lagfree. Anyway, this is only the BETA 1. Until the final release (which will be in September), we will most likely see at least 34 more BETA versions which will greatly improve performance. Cheers Epix :)
ZONEofTECH Sie sind herzlich eingeladen. Gefllt Ihnen dieses Video fr mich schriftlich in deutscher Sprache. Ich bin nicht Deutsch :)
ZONEofTECH ios 7 beta 6 is now available.
ZONEofTECH Can u add me in game centre? Friend request has sent
ZONEofTECH Nova 3 is not that demanding, my iPad can run nova 3 but cant run temple run 2 smoothly
ZONEofTECH Very nice review, but I think you guys should put the phone down on the table so we can view it better. All that moving of the phone back  forth made it a bit difficult to watch the vid. Its not a rant, just an observation of your latest vids Bless.
ZONEofTECH You were born on 7778
ZONEofTECH Great video! I have a 4s and this beta 2 has been terrible. Deathly slow, constant crashes and freezes.
ZONEofTECH is it possible to downgrade to ios 6.1.3 again? if so how do i do it?
ZONEofTECH Hahah CONGRATULATIONS BRYAN!!!!!! I hope you found my videos useful :) Be sure to LIKE, SHARE the videos so more people can see them and SUBSCRIBE to my channel (if you havent already done so), for more EPIC videos :D Cheers Bryan and congratulations again for being the 1st :D!
ZONEofTECH you want to have more and longer warrenties for these EXPENSIVE PRODUCT
ZONEofTECH Why didnt he compare Safari with Internet Explorer?
ZONEofTECH Samsung sucks, only their phones are good, I dont think theres much going on for the samsung desktops and computers
ZONEofTECH obviously they are excited
ZONEofTECH Kind of like this new major release, but there are things some users like me do not use, such as Maps or Calendar, although theyre great and built up very good.
ZONEofTECH Its nicer, not a feature to brag a lot about, but it keeps your desktop nice and clean when you use a lot of windows.
ZONEofTECH as much as i love apple they need to stop talking shit about pc and windows
ZONEofTECH did he say anal growth rate LOL!
ZONEofTECH They build supertankers also. I believe they are very good :P
ZONEofTECH Their TVs are amazing!
ZONEofTECH well..... thats one good point lol
ZONEofTECH Maverick is a reference to surfing not a cowboy. wiki pedia.orgwikiMavericks28location29
ZONEofTECH cleary hes talking out of his anux
ZONEofTECH love that Mac OSX Maverick.
ZONEofTECH why are they clapping
ZONEofTECH I downloaded ios7 for my iphone5 and my control center was a solid grey but I got some help from someone else and I resolved the problem but thank you for responding!
ZONEofTECH Oh, and btw, good vid. :) Im looking forward to the release of Mavericks :D.
ZONEofTECH apple was before microsoft. Gates worked in Apple
ZONEofTECH I think Samsung is actually pc it just made a new company so they would think that its good
ZONEofTECH I am really impressed with the way you handled this video. It is filled with a lot of information about the product. I just would like to know if the OS X Mavericks is equipped with a better antivirus? Come on, everybody loves the way it fights bugs and other threats but there is not always enough.
ZONEofTECH I work in IT for for government and I love it when some dumbass says i just dont know why the army doesnt switch to mac?.... duhhh.. maybe cuz it costs 100150 more for the same or lesser hardware. but they would not need to spend so much on IT... bullshit, there are always people who need software installed, software or operating system configurations, knocking out a power cable and all that shit... it would not make ANY difference. Mac are such gimmicks
ZONEofTECH duh mac grew way faster than pc.. pc market is already mature with wayyyy more users than mac. Who the fuck would want to spend 10001500 dollars more for the same or lesser hardware? Someone who is not too bright.
ZONEofTECH Ok... Whats your point Microsoft?
ZONEofTECH When is the iPod touch 5 giveaway done?
ZONEofTECH Im not wasting my money on that shit its just a different design same software
ZONEofTECH They are both awesome
ZONEofTECH Step up your game Xbox

ZONEofTECH Your channel is great dude! I think you deserve more than 7,000 subscribers
ZONEofTECH i hope this works with my LG tv
ZONEofTECH Great video, productions was very well done I thought. Glad I came across the video, its always nice to find a channel that puts in some effort for their audience. You seem to know what you are doing, congrats you have a new active subscriber.
ZONEofTECH I found one of these at Wal mart for 60. It says you can connect through firewire 800, do you have any idea how to do that?
ZONEofTECH will it deleate mt apps?
ZONEofTECH i like Stereo Heart!!! Good song
ZONEofTECH this doesnt even work for me, does it require a us ip address?
ZONEofTECH Summary : Just create a free U.S. iTunes Account.
ZONEofTECH Doesnt work, tried searching too but failed :((
ZONEofTECH how did you create a second account ? itunes asks for a credit card linked to a us address
ZONEofTECH Hopefully Apple will fix the iMessage activation error first..
ZONEofTECH apple maps in a car? disaster!
ZONEofTECH i could do this allready with a pioneer radio
ZONEofTECH I would be so scared to use Apple Maps
ZONEofTECH Most of this has been integrated with Microsoft Sync in various cars for a couple of years now. But Of course Apple will make it look like it is their idea and hype the bejeezus out of it.
ZONEofTECH iOS in the car         .
ZONEofTECH iRadio,although at the moment it only works in the US (so does Pandora :(
ZONEofTECH Can you go to sleep to one station, and wake up to another station? Does it stop after playing if you leave it idle?
ZONEofTECH It is :) The only difference between the 2, being that iRadioiTunes Radios ads are only 515s long (so yes, they are a lot shorter). I hope you found my videos useful :) Be sure to LIKE, SHARE the videos so more people can see them and SUBSCRIBE to my channel (if you havent already done so), for more EPIC videos :D Cheers Kyle :)

ZONEofTECH When the icons move its called parallax not dynamic wallpaper
ZONEofTECH Good job man keep up the good work I have a 4s wanna upgrade to ios7
ZONEofTECH Yes, thats what Apple calls it. I decided to name it live wallpapers in the video because a lot more people know what those are then parallax.

ZONEofTECH does doing this remove all of your data? like pictures and apps and stuff?
ZONEofTECH for me it says it will install the ios 7.0.2 but I want ios 6.1.3, so does it actually download ios 6.1.3?
ZONEofTECH You dont need RecBoot. Hold down both the top (power) button and the home button for 10 seconds, then after 10 seconds, let go of the top power button and keep holding the home button down for 8 seconds. That puts your phone into recovery mode.
ZONEofTECH you earned yourself a like and a subscribe :)

ZONEofTECH How much is this? Unlocked
ZONEofTECH Yeah, 469 ppi. Sorry about that :)
ZONEofTECH I said that at the end of the video :D Looks like somebody got bored and didnt watch it until the end hahahaha :D
ZONEofTECH you do realize the htc one has a smaller screen so thats why it has more ppi... if the galaxy s4 would have been 4.7 inch its wouldv had the same ppi
ZONEofTECH My net is slow whats the price Im using my 23G Imma buy phone
ZONEofTECH Correction  S4 doesnt have the highest ppi. HTC One does.
ZONEofTECH You do realize what would have means, right?
ZONEofTECH it isnt dw its progessing
ZONEofTECH 2hrs :) .. i think they limit the download speed on mega.. yesterday 160kbps down is the max i hit.. even my connection is 5MBs on download..
ZONEofTECH Why dont you get it in the UK...
ZONEofTECH I have the Iphone 4 running ios7.... worst mistake... Media player Stops all the time!!!  this is the worst update they have made so far.  Their best selling point of their stupid iphones is now a piece of shit. Shame apple... Shame
ZONEofTECH I cant get my music to play :
ZONEofTECH How can i change the pictures of the artists?
ZONEofTECH The music app is a flop. If you have an artist with multiple albums, scrolling through hundreds of songs becomes a chore. Anytime I listen to Buckethead I have to blow through hundreds of songs when instead of just 20 or so albums. Also, the reason it drains battery so quickly is bc of all the bright white backgrounds that are in almost all the apps. Creating white light requires a lot of energy and all the colors in the spectrum. Figured the geniuses at Apple would have known that.
ZONEofTECH its no available for europe and arabic country?
ZONEofTECH Searching for an artist with the new screen if you have hundreds of them looks more cumbersome than sliding the index in the old Music app, which I manage to do with one hand while driving.
ZONEofTECH The music app is the best way to listen to your music. No fucking way, really? Never realized.
ZONEofTECH Can you change the artist pictures?
ZONEofTECH I like the update. But I hate the music app. My family uses 1 iCloud account so there music goes to my phone and my music goes to there phone.the only bad thing about it. They need to make it where we can delete music from your phone.
ZONEofTECH so the music player is going to be FUCKING PINK!?? i hope i can change that, otherwise im not gonna update.
ZONEofTECH A COVER WALL MODE of Music.app on iOS 7 is so very UGLY!! It make too hard that I choose the music which I would like to listen to. and I want to watch my music videos on Landscape mode!
ZONEofTECH Nah man, this looks like shit
ZONEofTECH Oh wow... And I just noticed that the albums arent alphabetized when you select an artist. Also the sideways feature is a monstrosity. Definitely not a fan of the music app.
ZONEofTECH Fail. He tapped the radio song but it didnt respond. Btw I like the old ver better. So Im not updating
ZONEofTECH I think it changes along with your wallpaper.
ZONEofTECH Hello, well I registered in Bahamas as my previous Apple ID and password did not worked, :( so after this my itunes radio disappeared :(
ZONEofTECH FCKING IDOITS REMOVING COVERFLOW!! GRRRRR!!!!
ZONEofTECH didnt have in denmark :(
ZONEofTECH ALL WHITE AND PINK???? Are you fucking kidding me Apple.... fuck piss shit ass ARGHHHHHHH!
ZONEofTECH OMG I share an iTunes account with my mom and all she ever listens too is kelly clarkson and Michael bubl.
ZONEofTECH I have an iphone 4 but i dont have itunes radio can someone help me please
ZONEofTECH INSTANT REPLY!!!! HAAHA!! How cool is that :D?
ZONEofTECH HEY APPLE!!! SWITCH THE GODDAMN MUSIC APP BACK!!!!
ZONEofTECH fucks sake, I have an the new iPod 5th gen, I do no want radio, iCloud, genius or iTunes integrated into the music app, I get my music from CDs and torrents, I discover new music on youtube like everyone else and sync it straight to the ipod, simple. This is just a bullshit way for apple to make people spend unnecessary quantities of money on the spot. I have no use for the radio as most of the time its not connected to any network. Thanks apple.
ZONEofTECH Large shitmountain is this fake ios7. Why are you kill coverflow?? This was the best thing in Apple devices. This became a boring shit.
ZONEofTECH Thats the Biggest attraction Ive ever know about Apples application! I love it!
ZONEofTECH how do u delete the music though kuz it still appear kuz of ma icloud bu I dnt want em no more
ZONEofTECH nothing a little VPN wont fix )
ZONEofTECH For the othet country iTunes Radio is not avilable yet. But if you create an US account it run!
ZONEofTECH I absolutely hate the new music app. The old one works just fine... I wish they hadnt overhauled it.
ZONEofTECH Thanks for replacing my researched photos with wrong era crap photos I cant remove. ios 7 music player is just awful, just bad.
ZONEofTECH I cant even get music to play can somebody help me?
ZONEofTECH i know its not even in canada yet probably on the next ios update
ZONEofTECH people who just clapping and not hving a single smile on their faces are android executives !
ZONEofTECH Just make a US itunes account if you want to use it and your outside of the US
ZONEofTECH Free...with Ads Crowd claps
ZONEofTECH PINK!? Theyve clearly recruited a female lead designer where pink has been her colour preference! Women, pffff...
ZONEofTECH Cool I updated to iOS 7 sick thanks for the info!!!!!
ZONEofTECH i have am 4th gen ipod D:
ZONEofTECH WTF i have to wait till september . luckily i have the ipod 5th (.0.)
ZONEofTECH But sometimes I dont want to update my apps! What
ZONEofTECH Not hands on lying cunts. Fuck off and die linkbait motherfucker.
ZONEofTECH hands on your penis perhaps.. not on a mac pro
ZONEofTECH The cooling tech looks quite awesome, they can actually cut alot of cost from there, but the design is ugly on the outside hmmmm
ZONEofTECH So not a hands on demo, twat
ZONEofTECH heheheheh 101 dislikes ! asshole !
ZONEofTECH By what standard? One could easily build a Windows or Linux PC with the same specs for less than this will cost. Sure, it wont look like a trash can, or have that cool looking way of cooling it, but that really isnt that big of a deal.
ZONEofTECH Specs and data are all on Apples site for the public to see. Compare that to the previous gen Mac Pro or the system of your choice and then youll know.
ZONEofTECH coffe machine made into a computer nice :Dnext gen Mac coffe and computer into one whole machineThen you can play the computer day and night :D :D :D :D
ZONEofTECH if you learn more about the design youll find out why the design is bad. its very very hard to expand
ZONEofTECH I think it is ugly as hell, And they have taken away a lot of features. I will return to the pc market after waiting all these years it looks like a coffee pot. If this is what apple thinks is going to lead them for the next 10 years I think they have another thing coming,
ZONEofTECH Hands on demo,My ass .
ZONEofTECH Multiboard with a big central heatsink.
ZONEofTECH hands on not a hands on
ZONEofTECH I feel like Im taking crazy pills.
ZONEofTECH reminds me of one of those dirty radioactive click click flying trashcan ufos. whoever is flying in them.
ZONEofTECH They wouldnt be as big as they are if they were making bad business moves. This computer is lightyears ahead of anything else on the market
ZONEofTECH Im not being flippant, I really would like to see a demo of what it can do and how it compares to top PCs of the same price, once we know the price.
ZONEofTECH The Dual Ethernet Adapters would make for the most ballin and overpriced unix routerfirewall EVER!
ZONEofTECH So was R2D2. So what. :)
ZONEofTECH You can get 100 likes when you post an actual hands on video
ZONEofTECH WOAH APPLE TRASH BIN PRO!
ZONEofTECH !!      !!  :http:www.apple.commacpro
ZONEofTECH iOS has proven that they are the best. AGAIN
ZONEofTECH Android  Windows Phone  IOS 7
ZONEofTECH HA AHHAAH YEDSSSSSSSSS SUCK IT!1
ZONEofTECH I just turn this feature off.
ZONEofTECH 0:50 Epic! :D Fuck you android NFC sharing!
ZONEofTECH Apple are pathetic they didnt install NFC or there products so tried to make an app to replace it then tried to take to piss ahahaha Apple always stealing other peoples ideas.
ZONEofTECH For all you idiotic isheep out there, galaxies actually have something that is called group play, and you can do the something with pictures, music and documents, and that came out on the 4.1.1 update like say 8 months ago way before apple ever thought of it, apple is so far behind its not even funny
ZONEofTECH this most be on iphone 4S
ZONEofTECH wtf this was not a review
ZONEofTECH Hey fandroids do what your heart tells you and get an iphone
ZONEofTECH Airdrop can send only pictures, videos (mp4 only) because apple only supports this format, and maybe documents and thats it and only to iOS and mac devices. With Android you can send what you want on every device. And also when you dont have a internet connection you can share your music, videos, pictures etc via bluetooth with your friend with no restrictions, but only in android.
ZONEofTECH How is this a demo and review? Ugh.
ZONEofTECH You do not need WiFi for Airdrop. A network is created by the phones that are in proximity, through which files are there. I am assuming that anyone with an Apple ID and who are around you are shown up, unless of course they dont want to be seen.
ZONEofTECH And added instant discovery and a proper interface.
ZONEofTECH you can use wifi OR BLUETOOTH. And Apple is stealing other (you mean Samsung, right?) people ideas?! You think Samsung invented Bluetooth?! Its not samsungsapples idea!
ZONEofTECH The guy with glasses at 1:00 looks like Bill Gates LOL
ZONEofTECH OMG that is fuing ridiculous. Its like comparing infrared with wifi... BTW sending data via bluetooth or wifi exists way longer than any mobile apple device does. COME ON. You need a fuing JAILBREAK to actually send data via bluetooth with an iPhone or iPod...how retarded is that?!?
ZONEofTECH Apple love to pretend there making ground breaking tech when i could have done this on my phone back in 2001 (infrared sharing). Besides sending photos over wattsapp would be just as easy as this.
ZONEofTECH The Android fan boys are so butthurt over Apple. Get a life. Bump your phones to your faces.
ZONEofTECH No iPhone 4S?? That sucks
ZONEofTECH Sure, cause when you told Eve to bite the Apple it worked so well for all of us ...
ZONEofTECH iPhone 4 is not supported for the AirDrop ?
ZONEofTECH Great! I still have no clue how this works but I do not its not available on my iPad 3! I guess if I really want this feature, I need to buy myself a new iPad. Thanks Apple.
ZONEofTECH I did see that. I was just replying to Raghu Kalyan, though. :)
ZONEofTECH ever heard wifi direct? no? then watch this watch?vRM3Q1oiHTGU
ZONEofTECH Airdrop is not useful, it obvious need wifi connection If you dont have it, it is useless And NFC can send things across Android and new windows tablets
ZONEofTECH Its like android creates the function and later on apple creates the explained one.
ZONEofTECH LOL 0:51 He owned Samsung.
ZONEofTECH Can you airdrop from a Mac to iOS?
ZONEofTECH Its not working on my Macbook Pro (2010) with my IP5 running iOS 7 beta... Nothing shows up when both are on...
ZONEofTECH Filedrop app is a great alternative to Airdrop which Apple decided to only allow to work on iDevices with lightning ports. Bleargh!
ZONEofTECH Why they aint make it for iphone 4 that would have been smart more teens have 4 apple huhhhh that just made me pissed off
ZONEofTECH joey009ism i didnt see samsung using air drop but nfc so apple didnt steal there ideas
ZONEofTECH U discovered bluetooth in 2013. Good job apple
ZONEofTECH Fuck theres so many geeks in that front row I cant breathe p.s how is this different from Bluetooth and just sending a pic iphone to Iphone? I feel like this is just really simple and I should be more impressed?
ZONEofTECH apple dissing samsung :p
ZONEofTECH Its called all share cast.
ZONEofTECH You dont need WiFi Android fan boy!
ZONEofTECH What an unuseful video. Still have no idea what it is...
ZONEofTECH But its going to work only over wifi? No 3G or 4G LTE? Does anyone knows ?
ZONEofTECH Its called WIFI Direct on Android and its been there for a while now..
ZONEofTECH it looks like most people in the comments are confused between NFC and airdrop. NFC with Android beam establishes a temporary bluetooth connection to transfer data. Where as airdrop, the iPhone would ping other iOS 7 devices in the area with their own WiFi signal and make connection that way to send data. Now this isnt an immediate solution to Android beam because NFC goes beyond sending data between phones where your phone can be used as a wallet with NFC registers amongst many other services
ZONEofTECH Sucks its not for the iPhone 4 .
ZONEofTECH AirDrop DOES NOT need WiFi
ZONEofTECH So, basically it behaves like Nintendos StreetPass, but its manual and not automatic?
ZONEofTECH It not so interesting...(my opinion)..
ZONEofTECH how did apple not think it would be a good idea to be able to share songs through airdrop considering that android phones can. smh what a let down.
ZONEofTECH Still i enjoy watching Apple fans at keynotes that are so excited at everything Apple throws at them :)
ZONEofTECH I did! And then I flushed it down the toilet. It felt so good :) Money well spent.
ZONEofTECH For people who dont understand what NFC is like: you know when u take the public transport or use a card and scan it to read it, well thats a form of NFC. So we all use NFC already.
ZONEofTECH It seems that if theres no wifi available IOS 7 will simply use bluetooth to do Airdrop
ZONEofTECH I agree all apple do is steal other peoples ideas
ZONEofTECH You say a network is created between the phones. What protocol do you assume it uses? As far as I know, from owning a Mac, AirDrop works over WiFi. That network created is based on WiFi. What makes AirDrop easier to use is that the user doesnt have to manually set up that WiFi network. Once the user turns on AirDrop, hisher device is visible to any other device with AirDrop activated. Hope that clarifies things. :) Look up Wikipedia, too, for more info.
ZONEofTECH Well, Android Beam and S Beam need Bluetooth and Wifi (respectively) to work, i.e. to transfer files. The NFC only pairs two devices. AirDrop is useful between computers that you cant bump into each other. It is pretty much like sending files between devices with Bluetooth, but with WiFi. Id have liked to see AirDrop on iOS activated by NFC (at least as an option alongside the current method).
ZONEofTECH bump each other phone android got fucked !!!
ZONEofTECH Well I wouldnt rather bumping my phone with others and making sure ALL my friends can bump them with mine.
ZONEofTECH Except after 3 years and numerous devices with NFC, mobile NFC usage is nearly nonexistent in pretty much everywhere.
ZONEofTECH Sounds like group share from samsung. Tap tap!
ZONEofTECH I dont see any hate comments. Dont feel offended.
ZONEofTECH No airdrop for iPhone 4S :(
ZONEofTECH I did mention this in a comment :P It creates a closed WiFi network. It does not use bluetooth. A closed Wifi network is when multiple devices create their own private network and communicate through it. Therefore, you do not need to be connected to any WiFi network in order for this to work. I hope I was clear enough. :D
ZONEofTECH You understood it wrong. AirDrop doesnt need a third party WiFi network. It uses WiFi and Bluetooth. Actually, its pretty similar to AirBlue Sharing, except that AirBlue Sharing allows sendingreceiving to and from noniOS devices. Come to think of it, its the exact same thing :
ZONEofTECH Just got a message beta2 has been released
ZONEofTECH This guy knows what he is talking about
ZONEofTECH nope it works over bluetooth. Thats why its called Airdrop: you drop it in the air, and everybody close by can receive it. Thats why it only works with people close by.
ZONEofTECH id much rather bump my phone with others than making sure ALL my friends are on the same OS version as me, and have my account ID or whatever. AirDrop is so much more complicated than NFC...but just watch, Apple will include NFC in the next iPhone (whatever theyll call it, and will call it I Beam LOL
ZONEofTECH It creates a closed WiFi network. It does not use bluetooth. A closed Wifi network is when multiple devices create their own private network and communicate through it. Therefore, you do not need to be connected to any WiFi network in order for this to work. I hope I was clear enough.
ZONEofTECH I use chrome on my iPhone right now, should I switch to Safari when iOS7 hits the market?
ZONEofTECH I found it on google and added the Safari logo in it. So even if it were made by you, I did modify it.
ZONEofTECH Very informative .. Very nice .
ZONEofTECH how do i delete the favorites?
ZONEofTECH How more longer we much to wait for ios7 for ipad mini
ZONEofTECH Yes !! I got iOS 7 Problem is when will the beta expire i just wanted to know ........
ZONEofTECH When the beta expires there will be an update (iOS 7 beta 2) and you can update to that and it will keep doing that until they get to the final version.
ZONEofTECH Lol idc if you use it :P
ZONEofTECH You cant go fucking fullscreen with the YouTube app
ZONEofTECH Will ios 7 delete the safari version of youtube? Because Id be super pissed if it did.
ZONEofTECH Correction even when the firmware beta expires if its already installed on your phone you can still use it...
ZONEofTECH The thumbnail of this video was made by me, ask anyone on my Twitter too. iAust1n
ZONEofTECH Yeah i wanna know too!!
ZONEofTECH I like the new design for the lock and home screen and I dont use safari so
ZONEofTECH NO ONE CARES... No Offense.. Im only telling you this because iPhone has always been better at actually working correctly with ease
ZONEofTECH looks like wp8 multitasking to m3
ZONEofTECH Los de Apple si que tienen webos para copiar calcar a WebOS
ZONEofTECH What is funny is its a ripoff.. crackberry(.)comappleswipesthingortwoblackberry forums.crackberry (.)comblackberryz10f254applejustrippedoffblackberry816873 apple comiosios7 Command center  same thing as bb10 except its from the bottom on the apple instead of from the top on bb10 Notification center BB7 was exactly like that Peek at notifications  blackberry hub multitasking  exactly the same as bb10 lock screen  bb10 with a jelly bean look
ZONEofTECH Nice!!! Just like WebOS in 2010..
ZONEofTECH Im an Apple user and this is . How about taking notes while watching a video?, using the calculator while viewing your Notes ? This is something I really want to see item do. And samsung has had this feature on their mobiles for some time now .
ZONEofTECH That was a horrible preview of muliitasking
ZONEofTECH Wow. WebOS card multitasking.
ZONEofTECH for retards that like to spend too much money. iSheeep. It looks like it doesnt have anything close to the features Jelly Bean and BB OS10.1 has and by the time its released there will be Key Lime and 10.3 in beta (which 10.2 will have everything jelly bean has at its current state on the S4 like the eye reading n stuff)
ZONEofTECH The card multitasking is borrowed from webos. Such a shame webos didnt make it.
ZONEofTECH It seems that a lot of people hate the new multitasking :P I wonder why :D
ZONEofTECH Webos my favorite mobile os
ZONEofTECH multitasking and the old guy was much much better than this new, he had a lot more animations, understand?
ZONEofTECH They just improved something they already had.
ZONEofTECH faggidy skippady foopady, i busted a nut on ur sisters left cheek last night aftersheu sucked my cock. blahh
ZONEofTECH This practically makes the iPhone new all over again
ZONEofTECH I dont have siri on my ipad 2.. What should i do?
ZONEofTECH I hope this voice will be used in Voiceover on Mac and IOS.
ZONEofTECH BECUASE its not google
ZONEofTECH Very good upgrade ! Love it... Ios in the car is really great
ZONEofTECH Pulls web search results from Bing I dont agree with that. but I do like the new siri voice, it was a joke before.
ZONEofTECH Now the Siri mic sound is different but sound the same
ZONEofTECH tripleE02 I am impressed with it as well. I was one of the people who emailed their accessibility team and said they should make the voice of Siri and VoiceOver Sound like a person. And I think whoever read that email took it very seriously and passed it onto the people who are in charge of the iOS software. Thats what I like about companies like Apple. Is that they take the time to read customers feedback and do whatever they can to satisfy them. :)
ZONEofTECH Ha ha. He wants to buy the Chevy
ZONEofTECH have to get iphone 4 s sorry
ZONEofTECH I REAAALLY want them to have an option between the original and the two new voices of Siri. Sometimes I likeit to be classy with the original voice too, but like to have the new ones too
ZONEofTECH Does the new ios7 come with new sounds for texts and ringtones?
ZONEofTECH Weve integrated live search results from Bing... silence
ZONEofTECH i think il buy the new iphone
ZONEofTECH Djhey20 I agree I live how it sounds live a human .. Its like you have a real personal assistant .
ZONEofTECH Clever how at 1:10 they work in the new IOS name...
ZONEofTECH I like it. The new voices sound friendlier.
ZONEofTECH I dont like new voice.
ZONEofTECH lilkeith200 Yes, I am very impressed with Apple! Especially because of the fact they have done such an amazing job to make their products accessible for people like me whore blind, And those who have trouble seeing small print on the screen. Had it not been for them doing that, people with hearing and visual impairments would not be able to use their products at all.
ZONEofTECH My cousin John Magpantay is working with IOS in the car
ZONEofTECH I dont have siri on my iphone 4 ios 7 what should I do plz help!
ZONEofTECH I love the silence when they mention Bing search results lol
ZONEofTECH She sounds so realistic! I love it!
ZONEofTECH it would be awesome if the iphone 4 and ipod touch wold be able to use siri. the devices are clearly compatible.
ZONEofTECH Wow good job Apple I am impressed with how you made the voice of Siri sound more like a human!
ZONEofTECH I love the new Siri voice
ZONEofTECH Finally we can have a male voice
ZONEofTECH I love how the new voices of Siri sound like a real person, and not a robot. Thats amazing. And I hope these new voices will also be used when using VoiceOver. Keep up the great work, Apple! You peeps rule!!! :)
ZONEofTECH toll das gab es alles schon
ZONEofTECH its realised on iphone 4. yes. also samsung are just cheap plastic copy cats
ZONEofTECH For all you android users here bashing apple, why are you watching the video on apples new os? Why dont you go use the most advanced os?
ZONEofTECH And they also see it off copying Samsung ans getting fined Anyone with me no? Yes? Wel if you havent heard they did copy Samsung somehow and got fined for it
ZONEofTECH Is it going to be realesed for iPhone 4? If not im going to samsung...
ZONEofTECH IOS Released To public Sept 10
ZONEofTECH Yes, Samsung, not Android. IOS 7 is full of Androids old features. People who complain about Android are the people who have lowpowered devices. Get an HTC One or an S4 if you want to judge. I have an iPad 2 and it does have great battery life and performance. But as long as the limitations remain, iOS will never be better than Android. NEVER!!!
ZONEofTECH The ultimate surveillance device for NSA  the illuminati new world order
ZONEofTECH Yes, it will be released for iPhone 4.
ZONEofTECH It came out mine says 11 hours and iPad 9 hours
ZONEofTECH I bought that ipod for xmas and not long after I found out it doesnt have a back camera now im really upset :(

ZONEofTECH Yes I would very much like the iPod please:)
ZONEofTECH Ok!! i want to win the ipod

ZONEofTECH Someone Tell Apple To Put The Camera In The Back I Bought And Its Shit
ZONEofTECH You ask us yes or no. So do chicken lay eggs?
ZONEofTECH Id touch that Ipodtouch and I would like it love your videos and also play league of legends
ZONEofTECH why does every retard care about the 16gig ipod touch 5 without a camera
ZONEofTECH I LIKED NOW WERES MY IPOD TOUCH XD
ZONEofTECH No one cares that you got a A and if youre under 16, oh well boohoo, not everyone is fortunate like me. If youre much over 16, get a job loser.

ZONEofTECH Maybe its is dutch. It means little tree. Boom  tree, tje tells that it is small. Haha lol xD
ZONEofTECH How long did you update it?
ZONEofTECH 6th :) and yes I do plan on getting this when it comes out. It seems very worth it
ZONEofTECH Maybe I will get my hands on updated Xbox 360 firstx
ZONEofTECH :D nice voice much better then the old ONE
ZONEofTECH Haha I know, I have a cold :P which made me speak like Batman.
ZONEofTECH My fav feature is probably the fact that you can record now
ZONEofTECH U can record constantly and upload easier u dont have to buy a screen recorder
ZONEofTECH But why did xbox changed it to black huuuhhh
ZONEofTECH Is the Xbox One controller rechargeable like the PS3 controller, or is it still powered by disposable batteries like the 360 controller? I know they have rechargeable battery packs for the 360 controllers, but theyre usually sold separately and their life span is extremely low.
ZONEofTECH Neva used batteries for xbox 360 jus rechargeable
ZONEofTECH Will the 360 pads work on xbox one  do they conect the same ?
ZONEofTECH It has the same face plate because it was a demo not the real Xbox
ZONEofTECH Dude this video freaks me out especially its too loud
ZONEofTECH Watch this q5yhQiXzYL8 Still has batterys
ZONEofTECH Does the xbox 360 controller work with the xbox one?
ZONEofTECH you think theyll have corded controllers?
ZONEofTECH I was thinking the same. I have spent countless hours staring at the beauty of the original, pointless bulk under the controller. Why fix what isnt broken, right? I mean WHO NEEDS BETTER ERGONOMICS!? Problem?
ZONEofTECH nope, they still use batterys
ZONEofTECH Hope bf4 is optimized for this. the heli, heart beat, cars and tanks, guns, ext
ZONEofTECH why tf would they put it like that the batter back is ugly
ZONEofTECH no they already said it wont
ZONEofTECH They wont, because the hyper fast response wireless system they are using for the new ones. You can always just keep the 360 until youve built your librar of new games
ZONEofTECH This controller is wirelesswired. Plugging in the cable will send data via the cord rather than wireless and when not plugged in the data is sent wireless.
ZONEofTECH 1:35 my xbox has the same faceplate
ZONEofTECH You must be retarded to think xbox one killed ps4
ZONEofTECH xbox one killed and t baged ps4
ZONEofTECH is it chargeable or not
ZONEofTECH Nope .. it comes with rechargeable triple A batteries that can be replaced at any time. (ps this time you also get a cable that will charge your controller while you play with it, or you can just use that if your out of batteries for some reason)
ZONEofTECH I wanted to know what the two buttons do in the middle? I think its menu and switch screen to full size and back again but wanted to know for sure.
ZONEofTECH crisisish?! interesting choice of words.. So the battery will degrade eventually forcing a new purchase in controller?
ZONEofTECH sry should of said is the controller like the crap play and change or the nice charging station
ZONEofTECH YOU COULD BEEN CHARGE IT WHENEVER YOU WANTED IF YOU HAD A BATTERY PACK WHICH CAME WITH MY XBOX 360
ZONEofTECH Xbox one looks awesome!
ZONEofTECH at 0:18, you turned up the volume.
ZONEofTECH J allard is a hero of our day!
ZONEofTECH Shoutout to Barbara  Jack
ZONEofTECH How could you tell :)?
ZONEofTECH Is the iTouch giveaway true? Please reply.
ZONEofTECH Your mothers bush guys
ZONEofTECH how is it a piece of shit? Its the same damn hardware as the ps4 AMD 8 core APU with 8GB DDR3. If anything it has an advantage over the ps4 in that it has a redesigned Kinect, but beyond that theyre both low end PCs.
ZONEofTECH you dont know what the ps4 looks like though.
ZONEofTECH It does :) check the annotation I just added to see the PS4 design Trailer!
ZONEofTECH Kinect sucks honestly... its pretty much useless in most scenarios. So upgrading that is no excuse to say their console is better. I thought the Xbox 360 rocked and the PS3 sucked. But Now Im definitely leaning towards the PS4. Xbox is just doing everything PS4 announced before.
ZONEofTECH Why do people come on here and just say one console is shot and the other is good that both do the se at the end of the day you just play games on them
ZONEofTECH OMG DREAMCAST 2 IS COMING
ZONEofTECH There both mid to high end pcs actually.
ZONEofTECH Your mothers a gunther fuck ya lyfe
ZONEofTECH Lol not really i was not hooked by the conference at all and Ive been gaming on xbox for almost as long as I have been for playstation.
ZONEofTECH Ps4 still looks better
ZONEofTECH This is as good as YOUTUBE ONE! and we all know thats really good
ZONEofTECH The 2500 k is a piece of shit and no the wont be outdated by the end of the year and like I said most games dont even hardly utilize 3 gigs of ram so will you be a little more future proof? Yes but for now there will not be that big of a difference at all with pc games on the new console games.
ZONEofTECH XBOX ONE all in ONE!!
ZONEofTECH Please explain how this console stacks up to my i52500k 4.4GHz processor with 8GB of utilized RAM, 500GB SSD,3 case fans with aftermarket coolers on GPU and CPU, 850W power supply, and soon to be GTX 680(currently 6950 well overclocked to play any games on ultra). I can do anything that these can do and more and its at least 6 months before theyve even be released. By the end of the year theyll be completely outdated.
ZONEofTECH Haha the most trusted, reliable, popular gaming cpu is a piece of shit? No wonder none of your other comments make since. You have no clue what youre tlaking about.
ZONEofTECH it still doesnt exist :P
ZONEofTECH 8 core vs 4 core doesnt have anything to do with trust and reliability. i52500k is the number one recommended processor for gaming. Not to mention you will never need 8 cores for gaming. Using the argument you wont use 8gb of ram then saying Ill take my 8 core processor is idiotic. On top of that, if you own no consoles you have absolutely no room to debate on them. I have owned most consoles at one point or another, including all the modern ones and custom PCs. I can use experience.
ZONEofTECH Kind of bummed how they decided to still use a disk drive.would have preferred games to be sure stored in memory cards of some sort
ZONEofTECH Not really my your machine cant even utilize 8 gigs of your ram so there technically not that outdated plus most people have 8 gigs of ram anyways.
ZONEofTECH HAHAHAHA! Theyre already underpowered compared to gaming PCs and they arent even out!
ZONEofTECH haha its a piece of shit. PS4 all the way.
ZONEofTECH Is that realy true?? Youre kidding me.
ZONEofTECH Awwgh, I needed that for an important subject.
ZONEofTECH Well I manage to contact Misfitsman805. You were the 2nd candidate to the prize, which means that if I couldnt get in touch with Misfitsman805, then you would get the prize, but since I did get in touch with him, he got the prize. Anyway, congratulations for being the 2nd and good luck next time :) Dont forget that Im doing an iPod Touch 5th generation giveaway, so be sure to participate in that one as well! Cheers opal!
ZONEofTECH Congratulations to the winner!!
ZONEofTECH You are a honest man :) i doubted you and am sorry for that
ZONEofTECH You seem like an amazing honest great guy! I hope to win the iPod 5th gen because Ive always wanted it! If I win, please contact me katie.heartz.j.beiberhotmail.com and please subscribe to my channel :)
ZONEofTECH Red !!! The color that fits with ipod touch . I hope I can win the giveaway .
ZONEofTECH You actually showed the process of picking the winner, respect for that, and a thumbs up.
ZONEofTECH Hey,I am Opal Baker and did I really win????Yeah,me.What do I do now,how do I collect my win?Yipeeeee.
ZONEofTECH Aww, I was 7th. Oh well, congrats to the winner!
ZONEofTECH So if airplane mode is turned on, u cant track the iPhone using Find My iPhone right?
ZONEofTECH I like the look of the first one, but thats all it was to me, was a look. I really like some of the ideas in the fifth concept
ZONEofTECH If they add live wallpapers, that would be amazing!
ZONEofTECH Number 5. Good functions to same design. Number 1 seemed to be imitated from Windows. Apple doesnt need that
ZONEofTECH New name for video Cydia Tweaks 2013
ZONEofTECH The shelf on fifth video is the best idea. I dont understand why some people want ios to look like android or windows phone, if they want it so much then get a WP or adroid device. Number 1 looks awful.
ZONEofTECH 1st one!!! But not too many features!! Just keep it classy!!!
ZONEofTECH wow, amazing concepts , if only apple designers could think like Philip Joyce
ZONEofTECH Cool video but why dont you buy a samsung if you want all those things...its kind of like what a samsung has actually apple is known for its unique design those ios7 suggestions kinda makes it like a samsung or a windows phone
ZONEofTECH Surprisingly number one is fairly close to the real deal
ZONEofTECH Dont reply to him, hes a troll...
ZONEofTECH the first is the best and totally new OS :) Love it.
ZONEofTECH number 5 hasnt got any sort of design change apart from the additions like the widgets which Apple arent going to do, they have stated they are going to make it more glance able but not with widgets. 4 and 3 are so different users wont know how to operate which apple have already talk about and said that hey wont change the way the phone works to much. 2 concept much be a possibility but with a design model design. number 1 is probably most accurate.
ZONEofTECH r u fucking kidding me?!
ZONEofTECH Number one is the worst idea ever!!
ZONEofTECH Im not updating if its flat
ZONEofTECH Id really like the quick reply. I HATE having to leave my apps just to respond to a text.
ZONEofTECH absolutely 1 2 is too complicated to use
ZONEofTECH I also like that first feature in 5 (the first one)
ZONEofTECH nice! u should find a way to show it to then!
ZONEofTECH Countdown to WWDC Use this great app to help you Countdown to WWDC 2013! Just search Countdown to WWDC on the App Store!
ZONEofTECH some of these concept artists need to get jobs at apple i would love if apple made ios 7 like this
ZONEofTECH Concept 5  Thumbs down Concept 4  Thumbs down Concept 3  Thumbs down Concept 2  Thumbs down Concept 1  Thumbs up
ZONEofTECH Or you could jb your phone and choose which of these you want :)
ZONEofTECH I dont want iPhone to look like windows phone
ZONEofTECH 1 was the best by Joyce
ZONEofTECH Hey! I am an apple fan but I realised the third concept music is in one of samsung videos!
ZONEofTECH Concept 1 ( the last one)
ZONEofTECH The fifth and the first ones, were the ones people liked the most, because looks similar to android and the number 1, looks exactly like miui, a custom rom for android, check and investigate before reply this message. By the way I think that the iPhone with ios7 would finally be a decent competitor for android 4.2.2 if ios7 looks like a mix of number 5 with number 1
ZONEofTECH Its a concept...all of them are...READ the title.
ZONEofTECH And I love the flat display I cant wait till it comes out!!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH Number 1 because some people want a new layout for the homescreen and Im one of those people.
ZONEofTECH I wish icons were square there still rounded :C
ZONEofTECH i hop the new OS will not be TO flat, its not really beautyfull to see that
ZONEofTECH like your brain you stupid fucking fuck...
ZONEofTECH The last one being 1.
ZONEofTECH Pretty cool concepts! Realistically speaking, though, with Ive at helm iOS7 will most likely be a cosmetic makeover than a functional one. Afraid that since Jobs death Apple is no longer that forwardthinking anymore. Just my two cents.
ZONEofTECH yeah definitely they need to reinvent the ios, iphone design is perfectly fine, just update cpu gpu ram camera, done, and reinvent the shit of the os, thatll rocket launch them back on track
ZONEofTECH I think 1 is the best one. Actually 5 is good but if Apple want to be the best of the best than Android just please dont use that 5. Thanks
ZONEofTECH 00:43 yes we do go to the apple website
ZONEofTECH The first and fith were the best
ZONEofTECH Like if you vote Number 1 :D
ZONEofTECH ios update? on android u can use many homescreen replacement (launcher) like this homescreen
ZONEofTECH Its not steve forstall its scott forstall. Get a clue.
ZONEofTECH They should make u choose from the icons on both iOS but l like the 2 more
ZONEofTECH Me too I like the last 1
ZONEofTECH I like 1 a million times more than the real iOS 7.
ZONEofTECH Philips concept is so AWSOEME!
ZONEofTECH Yes, thats right. Why are you asking this :)) this you steal an iPhone recently :)?
ZONEofTECH I like the last one the most.
ZONEofTECH my top 5 on my wish list is: 5.automatic app update 4.get custom ios themes 3.better multitasking 2. quick reply for texting 1.widgets
ZONEofTECH Definitely like number 1 :)) xD
ZONEofTECH Philip Joyce is the best one!!(:
ZONEofTECH 3 looks like an android
ZONEofTECH The last choice, cause you can see a big difference between the iOS not just a tweak.
ZONEofTECH 1 and 5 are the best two but number 1 is more likely to be developed
ZONEofTECH The number one by Philip Joyce and number four by Kerroudj were the two best. If they can integrate both of them in the next IOS I will be very happy.
ZONEofTECH 1 was gorgeous. very elegant appearing. 5 had a real MS Metro look to it...didnt care for that at all!
ZONEofTECH Thats very awesome! I am very excited for iOS 7 this fall.
ZONEofTECH 1. Is best and the last is bullshit
ZONEofTECH My thinking: 5thSUCKS, 4thLOVE!, 3rdLOVE IT! :3, 2ndBLAH, 1stBEST ONE :3
ZONEofTECH They did :3 Its official.
ZONEofTECH I like the last one best!!! Good Job!
ZONEofTECH widgets for IOS haha, theres a few decades until apple gets that farby then google will be running holograms on android phones
ZONEofTECH yeah hahaha tha is not ios seven stupid its faake
ZONEofTECH Are you getting the ps4?
ZONEofTECH Pc gaming for the win
ZONEofTECH I might not get it. The rumours of never shutting off and no disk drive kills it for me. But, I love Microsoft and their games so maybe, in a couple of years, I will get it. :)
ZONEofTECH Yall? gtfo red neck fucker. I am an xbox gamer. My frist console. My best console.
ZONEofTECH Hey, I watched your money youtube video, and I have a question. If I make money, and youtube decides to give it to me, do they send me an email, asking for my P. O. Box ?? Plz respond. I need help
ZONEofTECH So Xbox comes out may 21st?
ZONEofTECH I think it will be better than the ps4
ZONEofTECH They will send you the money to your bank account, at the end of each month. Therefore you need to provide them with your bank account.
ZONEofTECH you no the 720 gonna be better than the p4
ZONEofTECH ,,nice music...who is it by?,,
ZONEofTECH wont pay a dollar for any apple product, wont even take their piece of shit product for free
ZONEofTECH S3 Mini. But I honestly suggest waiting for the S4 Mini to be released (should be released in JuneJuly). By the way, have you seen my S3 Mini vs iPhone 4S EPIC BATTLE? if not, check it out here: youtube.comwatch?vPghxzJE5eg It is basically the most detailed review of the S3 Mini, on YouTube, so please check it out. Cheers mitsostrianta30!
ZONEofTECH Ok what the hell happened to the world? Plastic???!!!!!!!! Just why apple? Just why
ZONEofTECH You know that specs on I phones are rubbish. Its just that theyre heavily optimized to perform smoothly. 300 is expensive for a poorly specd and quality phone. My xperia sp is 300 pounds New and its specs wise better and has a massive illumination bar
ZONEofTECH So people can afford not everyone is exactly bill gates
ZONEofTECH 300 is not cheep stop saying it cheep
ZONEofTECH I would probably go for it after my 5 gets old. so a few years.
ZONEofTECH My information is correct. Learn English before posting comments like that.
ZONEofTECH Its called the iPhone 5c
ZONEofTECH AND IN MY DAM COUNTRY IT IS GONNA BE 160 DAM BUCKS
ZONEofTECH Probably geared towards the teenage market. Adults will stick to the original
ZONEofTECH not htc! i had one, and it wasent good! I would probably say nokia lumia 920 windows phone instead, or sony!:)
ZONEofTECH X.X I cant even afford this one :c
ZONEofTECH This is horrible the iPhone 5 will be cheaper when the iPhone 5s comes out. Get a iPhone 5 instead of the iPhone mini. This sounds like a downgrade.
ZONEofTECH guess what its fricken 739 for a 16g and 869 for 32g in australia. gotta love this country
ZONEofTECH thank you very much for your advice!!! it really helps me!!! as for the videos i have see the two of them!!! now im gonna check the other six!!! D
ZONEofTECH It gonna cost 99 bucks were i live
ZONEofTECH 300 is about 200 so thats good for me
ZONEofTECH if the iphone c (cheap) is gonna be 300 dollars that doesnt make sense because at verizon the iphone 5 is 199 for 26 gbs
ZONEofTECH I think that this is legit and yes I think the plastic is for me even though it could have been better
ZONEofTECH This video was made in April you idiot!
ZONEofTECH 99 bucks where I live
ZONEofTECH the iphone 5 with 16GB is 200 dumbass not 300
ZONEofTECH GUESS WHAT IPHONE C MEANS.HAHAHA MEANS IPHONE CRAP!
ZONEofTECH Never get a galaxy phone they suck
ZONEofTECH im gonna buy a new smartphone and i want your opinion,whitch one should i buy: 1) the samsung galaxy s3 mini 2) the sony xperia go 3)the windows phone 8s by htc 4) the sony xperia P 5) the sony xperia J or 6) the sony xperia S please answer :)
ZONEofTECH Hello Guys  Ladies. Lets not get too carried away. Apple or Samsung, they are my best smartphones on planet earth. I love them all. Thanks Apple. Thanks Samsung. Keep up and go to the next level. Thanks Tech.
ZONEofTECH Its going to be cheap so it will be rubbish quality. I say they dont
ZONEofTECH Its not 300 ! Its 99 for 16gb  200 for 32 gb on selected carriers apple said it ! Go kill yourself dumbass !
ZONEofTECH Looks cheap and tacky!
ZONEofTECH No its not :) At least I dont think so. A lot of tech websites have posted this, including MacRumors, 9to5Mac, theVerge and so on. So I think its actually legit. Anyway, well have to wait and see for ourselves.
ZONEofTECH please what do you suggest should I wait for it or should I buy the Ipod 5 I basically I want it for these reasons and I have sorted them by the importance. Music, videos, and games plz if someone can answer
ZONEofTECH I really want a redesigned iphone 6. . . So i might get this cheaper ver. and use it for a year then get the iphone 6 when it comes out.
ZONEofTECH In the uk its coming out 13th of September
ZONEofTECH no its called the iphone 5c, aka the iphone 5 crap
ZONEofTECH TheDarkMiner1 300 may be the unsubsidized full retail price. Look closely. An iPhone 5 full retail at Verizon starts at 649.99
ZONEofTECH iPhone 5 already has Siri
ZONEofTECH C probably stands for china as it probably will be manufactured there and it would be cheap as its Chinese... No offence... If its under 200 then I might consider...
ZONEofTECH Sam Aaron if you dont like apple, why are you watching a video about apple?
ZONEofTECH Na Im staying with IPhone 5.
ZONEofTECH there will be a cheap iphone and a iphone 5s stupid
ZONEofTECH how blinded we were back then
ZONEofTECH this is the biggest bullshit ever :)
ZONEofTECH Christian Plummer 300 dollars, not pounds. Will probably be around 200 pounds
ZONEofTECH You Itards are hilarious! LMFAO!
ZONEofTECH 8s its a super awsome phone if got one, yellow and grey
ZONEofTECH 5mp camera i better keep my i4s
ZONEofTECH try the cheap plastic iPhone
ZONEofTECH Its gonna be called a iPhone 5c not mini
ZONEofTECH Its cheap when compared to the iPhone 55S. You wont be seeing a 20 iPhone anytime soon.
ZONEofTECH All of my S4 specs were true, except for the design. I got the camera , the CPU , the Storage , the Screen size  ,the Screen PPI ,the OS , the special features such as AirPlay right. The only rumour that did not turn up true for the S4, was the design, other that that I was 100 right. You havent paid any attention when you watched my video, or youre just trolling.
ZONEofTECH No such thing as an iPhone 5 s
ZONEofTECH GUESS WHAT IPHONEC MEANS.HAHAHA MEANS IPHONE CRAP!
ZONEofTECH I might get it for comparison to iPhone 5
ZONEofTECH this is fake as shit, i have adblock so you didnt even get your 114 of a penny for my view
ZONEofTECH Thats a stupid rumor. Why would apple make a iPhone 5 mini with a 4 display if the iPhone 5 has the same screen size. If they make a 3.5.. Oh wait they already have one and its called the iPhone 2g,3g,3gs, 4 and 4s. Ive been watching a lot of your videos and half the rumor and specs you name and say they are definitely true, you get them wrong. The galaxy s4 specs for example.
ZONEofTECH no its still freaking expensive man
ZONEofTECH I recently ordered an iPhone 5 from this website gegoshop.co.uk , shipping took a bit longer but their prices are extremely low LOOOL
ZONEofTECH the answer is samsung galaxy s4
ZONEofTECH I know that. Thats why I said that its almost as big as the iPad mini.
ZONEofTECH thats their goal... Hence the Galaxy part...
ZONEofTECH ,,all i can say is wooooow!!!.....when will it be available in the states and on which carriers?,,
ZONEofTECH Shouldnt they be able to put more pixels in a screen that big?
ZONEofTECH Samsung making more annoying phone these days.. S4 just okay than this weird phone.. Mega for what??
ZONEofTECH :))) ppi means pixels per inch. The human eye is not a display, it is basically a video camera, so it does not have any ppi. You probably mean the ppi above which you cannot distinguish the pixels on a display. That number is 300. examples: The iPhone 4,4S and 5 has a ppi of 326, while the Galaxy S4 has 441 ppi. Everything above 300 means that you wont be able to see any pixels on the screen when viewed from up close. I hope you found this helpful!  please SUBSCRIBE, LIKE and SHARE :)
ZONEofTECH I have a Galaxy Note 2. An I wanna get the Mega 6.3 maybe a few months down the road. I love big phone form factor. Yah, an haha I would answer it without a hands free. I want a Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3.
ZONEofTECH Yeah, I know. They also had the note which is quite huge. I guess in 5 years Samsung will be like: Today, were announcing the new Samsung Galaxy Mini, our smallest smartphone with a really pocketable screen size of 8 inches
ZONEofTECH which would you recommend getting? Galaxy S4 or the Galaxy Note 2? I have an iphone 4, and was thinking of upgrading to one of those, cause I like the microSD expansion port. I would like the larger screen of the Note 2...but still am torn between the two.
ZONEofTECH Definitely the Galaxy S4. You get a lot more features with that, which you do not get on the Note2 such as AirPlay, GroupPlay, SmartScroll and stuff like that. Check out my top 10 S4 features video for a more detailed look at the S4. youtube.comwatch?vbWTx04Ojy6o
ZONEofTECH What really was the point of them making this phone o? The S4 is WAY better!
ZONEofTECH Em. Ipad mini is 7.9inch
ZONEofTECH Im planning to get the s4 on a two year contract, after that I will probably get a mega.
ZONEofTECH This was a comparisson.
ZONEofTECH iphone sucks! good luck with that apple. androids the best and samsungs the best company.
ZONEofTECH S3 mini is better you ass!
ZONEofTECH Best Video in Youtube !
ZONEofTECH omg I phone lost I thought I phone will win soo shall I switch from I phone 4 a to s3 mini
ZONEofTECH sorry but the samsung galaxy s3 mini is better than iphone 4s
ZONEofTECH I knew it. I have an s3 mini. S3 mini wins
ZONEofTECH Yes android is better
ZONEofTECH Samsung galaxy s3 doesnt have iCloud? SO WHAT? That is not fail of device
ZONEofTECH iPhone games are better optimized? Dude wtf that is not fault of samsung . its so interesting how many idiots are on net
ZONEofTECH iphone the best samsung galaxy sucks
ZONEofTECH Samsung galaxy s3 mini is the best 4 ever...!! :)
ZONEofTECH Great Review! looking at buying the Samsung galaxy S3 Mini, and now you have fully convinced me. I dont know which color to! I liked the red one as well as the white! Help me decided? :)
ZONEofTECH The S4 Mini comes out in July, so it depends whether you can wait until July or not. Anyway, a good approach would be to get the S3 Mini now, and when the S4 Mini comes out, just sell it and buy the new one. Simply as that! Cheers Hardrocker98! also, please like this video if you enjoyed it and also share it so more people can see it, because at the moment it doesnt have that many views, and I spent 48h in total for making this series Cheers again :) and Thank you!
ZONEofTECH i have the samsung galaxy s3 mini but im saving my money for the iphone 4s
ZONEofTECH I have an iphone 4, should i sell it and get an s3 mini
ZONEofTECH Yes congratulation my favorite phone s3 mini
ZONEofTECH yeah..i mean my main problem is transfering games and apps to sd card...there isnt an option for that..and it s a bit complicated to do it with some other way....only 4 gb inside and got a 16 gb card and can t use it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.......only problem faced so far !
ZONEofTECH finally someone who made it perfect!! I know now what is my choise!
ZONEofTECH Totally agree, if only it was supported by modders..
ZONEofTECH I have the iPhone 3 GS for 2 years and is an amazing smartphone, this little device really improve my life with several apps and performance. I love apple products and now I want to get a new phone but the iPhone 5 is really too expensive here in South America is just unaffordable (750 with my monthly plan) and for that reason I want to buy another option that brings me the same quality and features than iOS but with half of price. Sorry for my English.
ZONEofTECH S3 Mini The Best Phone
ZONEofTECH umm, its not fair to compare a 8g to a 16g. Also you just cant say that adding a sd card is the same of just getting the actually full capacity. Unfair win for the S3
ZONEofTECH A great review. Thats helped me decide which phone to get. The Samsung for me and my wife. cheers
ZONEofTECH But i like the way of your reviews and u did well
ZONEofTECH In the past I always thought that Samsung galaxy sucks, but Now I checked the new galaxys and those are a really competitive, in fact in some aspects are better than the iPhone. Samsung galaxy have better price, better battery and more free apps. I love iOS because is really simple, but android are quite the same shit. Sorry apple now my new phone will be the s g s3 mini! ( thank you zoneoftech for the videos, were really objective. Congratulation! Sorry for my English.
ZONEofTECH your EPIC man, and ya know what, you have the best vs and review videos EVER
ZONEofTECH Iphone 4s WINS!! Lol!! ..
ZONEofTECH Its not going to be a huge upgrade over the S3 Mini. The design will suffer some minor changes, the camera will be upgraded to an 8MP one, but other than this an a minor speed bump, there will be no major changes.  some unique S4 features might be coming to the S4 Mini, such as Air Touch, dual cameras and so on My suggestion is to get the S3 Mini now and sell it when the S4 Mini comes out. Anyway, if you have any more questions, feel free to ask me! Cheers Hardrocker98!
ZONEofTECH Congratulation to my favourite phone (S3 mini
ZONEofTECH Thx for quick answer. Ive already shared it on my facebook and liked it . So , with all the info you know about s4 mini , would you consider it as a lot better device than s3 mini? and how will it cost in the beggining? so if for example costs smth like 450500 euro i will definitely buy s3 mini now and see about the s4 mini next year.. so my only downsides with the s3 mini are cam , processor ( and PPI but no so much for that ).So it worth to wait? P.S : size of the phone? dont want big one.
ZONEofTECH Whats your choice and why :) ?
ZONEofTECH Yes, you can output video to a tv with the S3 Mini, same goes with the iPhone (the iPhone 4S can even output wireless to the TV but you need to buy the Apple TV which costs 100). For the S3 Mini, you need an additional adaptor.
ZONEofTECH How can I fix my my control center because instead of it being translucent its a solid grey!
ZONEofTECH Ahaha! This was awesome. :D
ZONEofTECH Ill get a s3 mini its good to know that Ill love it :)
ZONEofTECH I got the s3 mini and i love it
ZONEofTECH should i wait the s4 mini ? ( i want a better cam thatn s3 mini and little better gaming ) btw i find s3 mini s size really good . so what should i do ?
ZONEofTECH Be fair lah. Must also show 16 GB for s3 mini lah. At first I found it fair. So I like your video and now I dislike.
ZONEofTECH iPhone 4S. I dont like Samsung products.
ZONEofTECH Me? an Apple fanboy? Nope, Im not. This was a fair review, go watch all the 7 parts. I went into every single detail, making this battle the most detailed on YouTube. And by the way, the S3 Mini won the battle.
ZONEofTECH I know :) Its by far, the most complete review on YouTube!
ZONEofTECH Thanks, be sure to like it and share it so more people can see it. Ive worked really hard for this (6h on average on each video  48h in total), unfortunately I do not have that many views. :(
ZONEofTECH Sanding galaxy s3 mini is better
ZONEofTECH which adaptor is needed for the mini?
ZONEofTECH Good that I was going to get s3 mini anyway
ZONEofTECH I really want the s3 mini but Im not sure Id the camera is good
ZONEofTECH Are you serious? A crap phone vs an iphone 4s? An iphone 3gs would be a better competition jeez
ZONEofTECH The price of s g s3 mini is 230 and the iphone is 320 so it mean that 8 gb is 230 and the iphone is 16 gb 320 is 2302and that is 460 with 16 gb so the s3 wins the price
ZONEofTECH iphone 4s doesnt start at 320 it starts from 450.
ZONEofTECH notverystealthy excellent commentary!
ZONEofTECH it isnt epic. the iphone much better
ZONEofTECH but in many reviews they told that installing apps on the micro SD is unable. so the micro sd card is only use for photos,videos and music. so comparing 8GB with 16GB is not so fair.
ZONEofTECH Saving up to get the Samsung galaxy s3 mini!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH Brilliant ! Super ! You is the BEST!!!
ZONEofTECH Just got the s3 mini It is great the thing that could be fixed is the camera thats it
ZONEofTECH This was an amazing comaprission
ZONEofTECH Thank you Paul :) I am glad I was able to help you and your wife. Be sure to like this video, share it with your friends and SUBSCRIBE to my channel for more EPIC video :) Cheers! Dan
ZONEofTECH Bad comparison!! PS: My opinion
ZONEofTECH I dont think these should have been compared. Maybe the s3 vs the 4s, but the mini is just a budget version. A contract for the mini is 17 a month ( unlimited data, 5k texts, 100 mins) and the same contract for the 4s is 27, so the price is a HUGE factor. Considering the price, the mini would win every time.
ZONEofTECH I have been having my gs3 for a while now but for some reason I want to buy the iPhone 5s when it comes out instead of the gs4
ZONEofTECH Ive got the s3 mini and it runs smooth I would recommend it over the iphone 4s
ZONEofTECH Thanks a lot man for asking my questions ! but i have one more.. what about the size of s4 mini? because i dont want to have a large phone , as i think tablets have that role and i need smth to fit in my pocket .. so if its gonna be pretty big i ll definitely get the s3 mini !
ZONEofTECH FIRST. S3 mini has Super amoled screen vs FTF on iphone and also S3 mini wins at gaming beous of bettee specs
ZONEofTECH You can get a micro SD card slot for 2.
ZONEofTECH Love how you call siri and svoice , your pocket bitch hahahaha
ZONEofTECH Thank you for your reply Alec, Unfortunately, the Siri vs S Voice video is not up yet. Ill let you know once its been uploaded.
ZONEofTECH They already have eye tracking.
ZONEofTECH Ive seen rumours that all android devices with front facing cameras will get eye tracking. They may not be true but I hope they are. I want to get an android phone.
ZONEofTECH i personally love android coz of customiation. so i win :)
ZONEofTECH When you have links in your videos to the s voice vs Siri and other things in your videos could you put a link in the description as well, because on the YouTube app on iPad you cant follow the link in the video :( . Good review :)
ZONEofTECH and optimalizacion on iphone ???
ZONEofTECH Working on it. Part 6, Part 8 and the main video should be up my midnight. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH Part 6 is up, as well as the Main video which includes part 8 and the results of the EPIC BATTLE! Cheers! julien
ZONEofTECH Can duel of Samsung galaxi Express vs Iphone 4S
ZONEofTECH Hi, Ive included the 8th part: Price in the Main episode, so please check that out.
ZONEofTECH Please please please do Samsung galaxy s4 vs iPhone 5 when the s4 comes out!!
ZONEofTECH I am going to do that :) Its going to be in the same format as this one. 8 episodes and a main video to link them.
ZONEofTECH S3 mini battery lasts 3 days ? LMAO it barely goes through day without charging .
ZONEofTECH where is the 6th part??
ZONEofTECH wheres the 8th part? thank you :)
ZONEofTECH In the unboxing and review of the Samsung Galaxy S 3 Mini you said that it had a noise canceling mic next to the micro usb port?
ZONEofTECH im sure that the s3 mini Has the noise cancelling mic
ZONEofTECH Wheres the call quality test?
ZONEofTECH Thats only the mic. It doesnt have a secondary microphone for noise cancelation. :(
ZONEofTECH Mine does. I did not modify or bought a used smartphone.
ZONEofTECH 9i hate apple with IOS
ZONEofTECH Lookin at this at my gs3 mini :)
ZONEofTECH Iphone 4s works better with 20 battery that the S3 mini ))
ZONEofTECH s3 mini is worse BUT I LOVE IT
ZONEofTECH The iphone is sort of better but in my country the iphone is about 800 and the s3 mini is 300 and the s3 mini is a good price
ZONEofTECH You can in Temple Run 2, and it looks way better on highest settings...
ZONEofTECH s3 mini is good bit bigger and awesome it is the best i phone bye bye
ZONEofTECH iphone won this round because its have 326 ppi density screen
ZONEofTECH The 4S only has 512mb ram because the OS is incredibly optimised, thus the lagfree OS. Android and iOS multitasking works on the same principle. The 2nd app is paused in the background, while some app services remain active in the background (like VoIP, file transfer and so on). The only real multitasking can be found on the Note or Galaxy S4, in the Multiwindow feature, where you can run 2 apps on at the same time and the screen splits in half. I hope I made myself clear.
ZONEofTECH S3 mini is very better, iPhone is good but s3 mini winner the compair :3
ZONEofTECH s3 mini much better, considering the price and all
ZONEofTECH iphone has a smaller screen plus the retina display obviously the image quality looks better, I know iOS is better and no lags and stuff but truly you get annoyed and bored by iOS. for me definitely S3 is my choice considering its almost half the price and doesnt carry the famous front and back iphone glass which TRUST ME sometime youre gonna break it ... happens to almost everyone
ZONEofTECH Ive got s3 mini. Best phone Ive ever had. I had iPhone 4 before. Kinda wish still had it cause of IOS 7. s3 mini much better experience though
ZONEofTECH who puts an ad in the middle of the vid
ZONEofTECH that was a fast reply :D
ZONEofTECH Its not a real multitask thats why iphones has only 512mb of ram memory!
ZONEofTECH Lol the s3 mini rules see how much more apps it had open also I am using mine now
ZONEofTECH I think it is unfaire you need to do iPhone 4s VS samsung galaxy s3 and not THE mini
ZONEofTECH The back button is more like a cache of some sort, if you close an app with the backbutton but its still in the recents then it will open faster than if its not in the recents, however an app in the recents doesnt load as fast as an app that was minimized with the homebutton (actually this apps dont load at all because they are actively running in the background) Just some thoughts and criticism, keep up the good work!
ZONEofTECH Wow, thx :D I guess you meant 2012, Ive started this channel in 2012 August :P
ZONEofTECH s3 mini woW better and the qq prize
ZONEofTECH ZONEofTECH:Im a 12 year old what should I buy not beacuase of price?
ZONEofTECH I want to get samsung galaxy s4. I currently have a very bad 30 phone :(
ZONEofTECH i watched this on my s3 minii
ZONEofTECH Wooooh!!! YEY Still for iPhone  Apple is Unbeatable hehehe LOL (just for me) Peace for other gadget users
ZONEofTECH Idk I dint have problems comparing the two cause theyre both different phones. And I own both so nothing to hate really.
ZONEofTECH hi guys some someone pls help me i have a samsung galaxy s3 mini and the camera doesnt takes the picture straight away , i want the camera to take the picture as soon as i press the button can someone pls help me , thank you .
ZONEofTECH This was a great video man! Appreciate it! Going with s3 mini though!
ZONEofTECH clearly hes been playing iphone more as he is on much further in the games
ZONEofTECH Letting the apps open was unfair with s3 mini coz iOS doesnt have multitask so s3 mini was working harder!
ZONEofTECH The temple run test was slightly unfair as you could tell the s3 mini had not run temple run before but the iPhone had
ZONEofTECH You cannot change the graphics settings in Temple Run not Real Racing 3. Both phones run the games at their highest possible settings.
ZONEofTECH Windows Phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH s3 mini vs 4s tie , S3 vs 4s  S3 , S4 vs iPhone 5 S4 , Samsung Vs Apple  Samsung for 2 at 1 :P Done
ZONEofTECH iOS does have multitask...
ZONEofTECH Also if you press the backbutton on the S3 the app closes! Its still shown in the recents but its not running anymore, if you want to go to the homescreen but the app should run in the background you have to press the home button!
ZONEofTECH the samsung galaxy s3 minni clearly won on the second app ..
ZONEofTECH Samsung is just awsome face it
ZONEofTECH The iPhone has no anti aliasing either, the smoother edges are due to the higher pixel density! (you can see the same effect if you compare a 22 FullHD Screen with a 27 FullHD screen) Because the pixels are smaller the little stairs on the edges are smaller too.
ZONEofTECH You cant compair one game iniciated (iphone) with one never played (s3 mini)
ZONEofTECH well lazydougie28 ur right but also remember the more megapixel the camera have the sharper the better the camera will be
ZONEofTECH IPhone 4 s has better mic voice sounds more sexy
ZONEofTECH You mean upload the sample for each phone?
ZONEofTECH che paragoni stubbidi che fanno razza di coglioni che siete
ZONEofTECH but how much do they cost ?
ZONEofTECH HEY! Whats that EPIC Music called?
ZONEofTECH Win the camera of iPhone 4s
ZONEofTECH logicly I Phone has a better camera than s3 mini because it has 8 mp and s3 mini has 5 mp.
ZONEofTECH S3 mini has a bettet Mike than the Iphone 4S
ZONEofTECH its not about the megapixel of the camera but the lens they use in camera. s3 mini is better.
ZONEofTECH Omg dude Samsung is better
ZONEofTECH In video iphone and fhoto s3 mini
ZONEofTECH Iphone 4s has better contrast when taking picture or video than s3 mini
ZONEofTECH s3 mini 5 megapixsel ci bastano per dagli botte in testa a li iphone
ZONEofTECH Thank you, please be kind and share and like this, so it gets the number of views it deserves. Cheers dator!
ZONEofTECH samsung is way better retard!
ZONEofTECH I talk about the price at the end of the main video. Link is here: youtube.comwatch?vPghxzJE5eg
ZONEofTECH 4S Is Better You Are Fuckin Crazyy
ZONEofTECH The iphone 4s doesnt have macro mode.
ZONEofTECH 5 megapixel just okay for me.. hehe
ZONEofTECH Thanks, very helpful !!
ZONEofTECH iphone seems like its worse with the rolling shutter, also iphone 4s autofocuses, which is all bullshit.
ZONEofTECH wait you cant auto focus in video mode on the mini? thats the greatest thing ive ever heard
ZONEofTECH I hav got s3 mini its so good i would recommend to evryone:)
ZONEofTECH S3 mini is the best!!! :)
ZONEofTECH S3 mini is si cool!!!
ZONEofTECH Son of a bich you hate the s3 mini
ZONEofTECH you love the 4s admit it
ZONEofTECH S3 mini is the best!!!
ZONEofTECH Is the SIII Mini can play HD Movie or cannot??
ZONEofTECH Yes, the S3 Mini can play HD movies, but can only record in 720, while the iPhone 4S can record in Full HD, which is 1080p.
ZONEofTECH Yeah iphone 4s Rulez !!!! Posted by iphone 4S :p
ZONEofTECH Thank you.you helped me so much to choose
ZONEofTECH iphone 4s yeahhhhhhhh

ZONEofTECH iPhone 4 or S3 mini? (Notice I asked for iPhone 4, not 4s)
ZONEofTECH Thank you WazzUppProductions :) WAZZZUUUPPPPPP!!!
ZONEofTECH Dan is there a bug with the new starcraft to get random?
ZONEofTECH i meant video i got over exited :D
ZONEofTECH yup i have.:)) your the best please make a updated viedo :)))))
ZONEofTECH Yeah, have you seen my glitch video? It works on HoT Swarm as well. I can make a new video for HOTS only, if you want that.
ZONEofTECH iPhone looks old and shouldnt be given 5 stars.
ZONEofTECH I know that I love ya man and it always showing entertaining videos
ZONEofTECH Accurate video, but dont be put of the s3 mini. Remember this is comparing phones with a 300 difference, s3 is AMAZING for the price.
ZONEofTECH Watching from s3 mini...wanna get 4s too ..cool phones
ZONEofTECH i got s3 mini for my mom she loves it
ZONEofTECH in hardware I will go for s3 mini
ZONEofTECH Id like to have that S3 Mini
ZONEofTECH I might get this in my phone store it has the pebble blue color
ZONEofTECH before the video starts i had the Sapeurs advert from congo brazza WTF!
ZONEofTECH To much time looking in and out of the box
ZONEofTECH The plastic it is cheap mine fallen on the floor and it haves a scratch I it even wasnt that high maybe 2 or 1 half feet drop
ZONEofTECH ZoneofTech Ok ) By the way have you tried gaming on the s3 and if so how good is it in this aspect?
ZONEofTECH Is it possible to have multiwindow on this phone?
ZONEofTECH Inyoure..? I think its pronounced inear )
ZONEofTECH The ones that come with the iPhone and iPods are not. In ear  headphones with a rubber thing so they are fixed inside your ear.
ZONEofTECH zoneoftech what color shuld i choose?.. cause my mom will buy me this phone.
ZONEofTECH I might try that in another video if Samsung lets me do it :D But I highly doubt it xD
ZONEofTECH A lumia after 1 month is horrible even NOKIA LUMIA 920 but The S3 mini is better i think!! :)
ZONEofTECH Which is better Sony Xperia Tipo, Miro or this one?
ZONEofTECH What ROM is on it ? 4.2 ?
ZONEofTECH 3:15 for the unboxing
ZONEofTECH hey the s3 has the camera in the middle with the speaker on the left hand side and the flash on the right hand side for your information....
ZONEofTECH i will buy this soon what color should i choose black or white?
ZONEofTECH Does the s3 mini lags :(( ????
ZONEofTECH I have no problem with this phone , when im playing heavy games like nova 3 it works perfectly
ZONEofTECH Should I buy this phone I m 10 and my hands are sort of small and I think this phone would be good
ZONEofTECH Should I buy this pho
ZONEofTECH Brown color will be the best :) Hope od you will but that :)
ZONEofTECH In your headphones :)
ZONEofTECH Im so excited! im getting mine tomorrow !! :D
ZONEofTECH Yes, I have.Ive even made a video of it. Actually, I have an entire series called EPIC BATTLES: S3 Mini vs iPhone 4S, in which I cover every aspect of the 2 phones. Check it out: main episode: youtube.comwatch?vPghxzJE5eg Click on a thumbnail in the main episode to see a specific part of the battle, such as GAMING, PRICE, CAMERA and so on. Cheers Izak80! :)
ZONEofTECH do you really think we care about whats on the outside of the box
ZONEofTECH but its like a rubber
ZONEofTECH The grand the big one it sooooooooo much better
ZONEofTECH my s3 mini always lag what can i do to fix it
ZONEofTECH Should i get samsung galaxy sIII mini or the nokia lumia 620 pls reply me as soon as posibble thank you
ZONEofTECH Apples headphones are In ear
ZONEofTECH Does the s3 mini support USB OTG and MHL (TVOUT)?
ZONEofTECH its the younger brother of s3 its the s3s child wtf
ZONEofTECH It doesnt matter what model you get you cant save apps onto the sd card your stuck with apps on the phones external memory it pointless having an sd card slot when you not allowed to save apps and games to it
ZONEofTECH Sweet thing!!! ) If youre from UK get the GALAXY mini from Amazon  amzn.to16TPlHh
ZONEofTECH Ryan boros thank you so much
ZONEofTECH does this phone have NFC???
ZONEofTECH i just hate the fact that it doesnt have the led indicator!! urgh apart from that id love to have it for my next phone
ZONEofTECH which would you recomend SGS2 or SGS3 mini ??
ZONEofTECH okay but... will it blend?
ZONEofTECH So my porn will be high definition?
ZONEofTECH iphone5  710 galaxy s4  910 i think the Galaxy S4 is the new generation of mobile phones iphone5 looks good and has a simply system
ZONEofTECH its not Pentile Matrix ist RGB matrix
ZONEofTECH I dont understand why others are always saying samsung s4 is laggy but still watching s4 reviews in YouTube. .haha..
ZONEofTECH No oled display....shit!!!!
ZONEofTECH Why not just touch it
ZONEofTECH innovative features that makes samsung unique and more advanced in technology compare to others.. apple is so boring..after using it in just 5 minutes, I feel so bored. still enjoying my s3, but galaxy s4 is the best so far, waiting for note 3 to be my next phone.
ZONEofTECH What a completely useless feature.
ZONEofTECH If you dont like TouchWiz, dont get a Samsung phone. Simple as that. Dont take away from the stock beauty of the phone itself. Motorola is more of a stock experience compared.
ZONEofTECH This is the best phone in the world. Its a beast. 441 ppi on a 5 inch display, 2600MHz removable battery, 13mp camera, just hit over 27,000 on atutu benchmark, Innovation, Innovation and innovation, Samsung did a fantastic job with this beast. All this in a smaller footprint than the SGS3. So much more than you can write about. Thank You Samsung
ZONEofTECH Says right here that there is one. samsung comglobalmicrositegalaxys4
ZONEofTECH TouchWiz is so fucking horrible. It made me learn how to root and flash my S3. Damn you touchwiz, you turned me into flash junkie. d2att.zip FTW!!
ZONEofTECH People complaining about 8 cores is effing retarded. Samsung DID NOT put 8 cores to make the phone more powerful. No. They did it so that they can deliver decent power, and the same time, deliver much better battery efficiency. That is the whole idea behind 8 cores. BETTER BATTERY LIFE. get some effing education GEEZ Also people who complains about the size are retarded since s4 is smaller than s3 in every aspect(except for the screen size)
ZONEofTECH what if your hands are dirty, or wet, or you dont want fingerprints, etc.
ZONEofTECH i don get it people really hate the s4 but still watching video about it LOL, if you hate the s4 just don buy it simple as that.
ZONEofTECH I love the S4 review I cant wait to own one!!
ZONEofTECH The guy on the table has an apple laptop and is at an electronic convention. This must be his first one.
ZONEofTECH Wenn Euch jemand in der UBahn so richtig eine scheuert, dann liegt das an den Airgestures vom Samsung GalaxyS4: Samsung Galaxy S4 HANDS ON  The Verge
ZONEofTECH Check out this video on YouTube: I want this phone time to start saving
ZONEofTECH MAN!!!! (what is the PRICE???) I just sooooo have to buy it
ZONEofTECH Even s3 is better than the iphone 5
ZONEofTECH thanx so much, its really helpfull
ZONEofTECH You might be waiting a while.
ZONEofTECH Cant decide if i should by the samsung galaxy s4 or iphone 5, or the next iphone...
ZONEofTECH damn thats a really good phone! lol
ZONEofTECH 1:30 Mbps is Megabits not Megabytes. 1 Megabyte is 8 Megabits so just divide 50by 8 and youll get it about right. But if you want more exact info on the 10050 Mbps is more like 256 KBps.
ZONEofTECH Of course is better than the i phone my s3 is better can you imagen the s4 . Too much better
ZONEofTECH Iphone is still a good phone I personally love galaxy more I have the s3 galaxy s4 is a monster of a phone because well galaxy dares to go into the future while iphones sheer simplicity is so easy to use but the galaxy lets you have your phobe your way with NO restrictions... GO Galaxy!! !!
ZONEofTECH grt video n samsung is hell load of features to stay ahead of iphone, they r history
ZONEofTECH Samsung always gonna be on top
ZONEofTECH Megabajts ? megabytes I think...
ZONEofTECH good review but all your screen boxes are very annoying... would slowly drain my life away from me... cant subscribe or I would obviously die
ZONEofTECH the screen is amazing , but 5 inches? it seems like a phablet (smarpthone  tablet in one).
ZONEofTECH Top video congrats! Am thinking to jump on a Galaxy Xcover 2 )
ZONEofTECH Of course yesI am getting the S4  up from my awesome S3. And yes, this phone is universes ahead of the iPhone.
ZONEofTECH did he say as translator
ZONEofTECH when does it come out?
ZONEofTECH I buy both of them but now it different to identify which one is good iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy S4
ZONEofTECH But why it got to be so big? Lol I love everything else.
ZONEofTECH 1000 likes from me and who are those people that disliked??
ZONEofTECH Of course a track phone hooked up to a car battery would be better than a iPhone iphones cant do anything
ZONEofTECH watchany1 oh really? Your the stupidest person on earth arnt you? :)
ZONEofTECH Anyone trading in their iPhone 5 for this?
ZONEofTECH 1000 likes from me .... Who r those people who disliked...?
ZONEofTECH Seriously, that Virgin Mobil commercial is funny as hell. And I normally hate ads.
ZONEofTECH you meant CAT3 100 Mega Bits per second mind the difference :)
ZONEofTECH you can root your android device and its supposed to be better than the jailbreak
ZONEofTECH will it have a adobe flash player
ZONEofTECH i was waiting for iphone 5s but fuck it this one is 3times better then iphone. allways on top. i love u samsung.
ZONEofTECH Smart Scroll does not detect the location of your eyes. all it does is notice that you are looking at the screen, and it begins to scroll when you tilt the phone up or down while looking at the screen.
ZONEofTECH Cannot wait to get mine I have a s3 and it good so emagine s4 wow
ZONEofTECH iPhone sucks. It dosent make any sense. Everyone, that know what a real phone is, can see that Samsung Galaxy S4 takes the win, meanwhile Apple is crapping in their pants LONG LIVE TO ANDROID!
ZONEofTECH The Last Eye Detection Feature has amazed me... I Mean it would have take them the years to synchronize the eye movement to the screen.. Just WOW
ZONEofTECH iPhone 55S KILLER. team android
ZONEofTECH Yes Im getting one and yes its better than an iPhone
ZONEofTECH yeah, i b getting s4 in near future... its better than i phone bcause of special features like air touch , smart scroll,  adapt display...
ZONEofTECH will it have a adobe flash player
ZONEofTECH i was waiting for iphone 5s but fuck it this one is 3times better then iphone. allways on top. i love u samsung.
ZONEofTECH Smart Scroll does not detect the location of your eyes. all it does is notice that you are looking at the screen, and it begins to scroll when you tilt the phone up or down while looking at the screen.
ZONEofTECH Cannot wait to get mine I have a s3 and it good so emagine s4 wow
ZONEofTECH iPhone sucks. It dosent make any sense. Everyone, that know what a real phone is, can see that Samsung Galaxy S4 takes the win, meanwhile Apple is crapping in their pants LONG LIVE TO ANDROID!
ZONEofTECH s4 32 gb 64 gb micro sd
ZONEofTECH The Last Eye Detection Feature has amazed me... I Mean it would have take them the years to synchronize the eye movement to the screen.. Just WOW
ZONEofTECH 1:26 you said does 100 MBPS Megabytes. Isnt that too fast lol.
ZONEofTECH iPhone 55S KILLER. team android
ZONEofTECH Yes Im getting one and yes its better than an iPhone
ZONEofTECH I changed from iPhone My only negative is that instructions for the bazillion features are not easily had. On the other hand bye bye iphone got the Samsung tablet and s4 WONDERFUL
ZONEofTECH good but toooooo costly
ZONEofTECH I will be buying the GS4 and it is a lot better than the Iphone 5. By the way...13 megapixel camera! Plus 2 megapixel front camera! To top it all off...has like a 421 or 400 something ppi screen. Best Phone on the market! You also forgot group play I think and I think the chat on app has some features special to the GS4. Awesome phone!
ZONEofTECH i heard it has groilla glass 3 un real
ZONEofTECH u better l will buy it the Samsung Galaxy 4 and in black....come to papa
ZONEofTECH 4 days of battery power? lol good one
ZONEofTECH I have galaxy s3. I am stucked with it. I wish Id have gotten iphone. All the features are stupid and never work the way they suppose to s3. I am sure that will test in this 4 or whatever
ZONEofTECH MegaBITS not BYTES...
ZONEofTECH what amazing this phone OMG i love Apple but sorry Apple samsung did something is better
ZONEofTECH Let us see the original first then give you the suggestion.... However the AppleApple only, after S4 release will tell you the truth..
ZONEofTECH does the Samsung galaxy s4 has Arabic keyboard ?
ZONEofTECH revenge....u mean sue watever thing? xD
ZONEofTECH This is the best phone in history.
ZONEofTECH Mbps is megabits per second, not megabajts )
ZONEofTECH getting the S4 for sure my dad got the iPhone5 ..... S4 is an insanley awsome phone
ZONEofTECH I like how these new, awesome features are actually noticeable, influential, and helpful. Unlike certain platforms that make a HUGE deal out a still small 4 in. screen, a bit lighter body, and a little resolution improvement. cough APPLE cough
ZONEofTECH Same with me. Thinking of getting this and keeping my iPhone just in case.
ZONEofTECH It has a real nice features and very easy to use but its ugly , I dont like the shape of that phone and its too big !!
ZONEofTECH your a pretty android fanboy arent you. You scream that on all the android videos almost ..
ZONEofTECH That friggin eye scroll thing got me.
ZONEofTECH Its Better Than the iphone 5...............
ZONEofTECH Random comment? :D Or is my name Ashley and you are secretly in love with me?
ZONEofTECH The S4 mini will be a 4.3 with a Dual Core processor, so it wont be the same specs, but the screen will still be epic and ofc will be much better than the crapple i(diot)phones, as usual :D
ZONEofTECH Just to correct you a mistake... The Galaxy S4 isnt the first to have the WIFI ac... the HTC one that came out few weeks before do have it too... Cheers
ZONEofTECH hey its not big . dimensions of s4 is same as s3. but the screen is slightly bigger thats all.check it if u want !!!!! :):):):):):)
ZONEofTECH buy buy iPhone 5 ! ! ! !
ZONEofTECH Smart Pause???????? HTC ONE has a full hd Super LCD3 capacitive touchscreen with 469ppi pixel density whereas GS4 has a super amoled screen with 441 ppi pixell density ... so neither GS4 has the best screen in the market nor HTC One .. It varies frm person to person

ZONEofTECH You are really really really excited because you found your first pubic hair ?
ZONEofTECH Im so going to get the Samsung galaxy s4 !!!

ZONEofTECH It its true...it will be very owesome!!!!
ZONEofTECH no words its awesome :)
ZONEofTECH This video was made A WEEK BEFORE the Galaxy S was even announced. Everything was just rumours and I WAS 99 right, except for the design. All the specs turned up to be the SAME as the ones in the video. For the FINAL specs and TOP 10 FEATURES, check out my latest video, which covers everything on the new Galaxy S4.
ZONEofTECH This is the best racing game I had played. Nice control than other racing games. Thank god it is free!
ZONEofTECH I still have the S2 and I have compared it to Ip5 and I know my S2 is better. What is Apple going to do to compete with S4... I dont know... Apple Lost the Hardware War, now Samsung is beating them in software... I only wish BLACKBERRY users would give Galaxy a try... any Galaxy... even the S2... which I now have... P.S. I was a Blackberry user from NEXTEL days... Blackberry was a Great phone... But you have NO ideal what you are missing with ANDROID. Same Goes for PALM dieHards.
ZONEofTECH How wrong could you get.... I mean really.
ZONEofTECH if u bye the iphone5s u bye the same thing u bought a year ago
ZONEofTECH VIVA la I Phone forever !Apple Mac I OS is the Bettler vwry Bettler system.I have two, the SGS3 and the IPHONE but I must say that the the I Phone is realy the best and only one phone etc. With all his systems,look and specs and and and....etc.
ZONEofTECH Most models will probably be stuck to 4 cores due to battery life.

ZONEofTECH yep its like having a brick in your pocket
ZONEofTECH you havent seen nothing yet just wait for the Galaxy note 3. that will blow your away.
ZONEofTECH if u bye the iphone5s u bye the same thing u bought a year ago

ZONEofTECH Its going to be completely premium finished and have a touch home button
ZONEofTECH iphone killer!! yay!!
ZONEofTECH anybody who owns an iPhone. now should be ashamed and embarrassed in themselves.
ZONEofTECH it looks like the s3 no big difference
ZONEofTECH iFags be like iphone 6 is coming. S3  S4 iphone
ZONEofTECH LoL, yup you knew everything about the S4 LoL, schmuck
ZONEofTECH I like this phone,but it is expensive, I heard a phone called OrientDeal N9500 is just like galaxy s4 ,is there anybody know it?
ZONEofTECH iPhones suck now. They never really change. The same icons and features since the iPhone 1st dropped.. Samsung!!! S4
ZONEofTECH if all of these features are true, APPLE can SUCK it
ZONEofTECH facebook.compagesSamsungGalaxyS4Giveaway430970456993569 Like them on Facebook theyre giving away Samsung Galaxy S4 thumbs up this comment! 3
ZONEofTECH Legit, effectively it has two quad cores but for marketing purposes they are calling it an Octocore. The processes have different functions on the phone, one quad core processor preforms all the active processes while the other one preforms all the background processes.
ZONEofTECH you should be ashamed for saying iphone V is the best fucking fail of a phone.
ZONEofTECH Really Disappointed with ZONEofTECH Sharing Wrong Information.. A Faggot LIAR.! i Click Unsubscribe and Click Dislike...never gonna watch your Videos again... 3:
ZONEofTECH the link for your new video doesnt work
ZONEofTECH Too many errors in your info.
ZONEofTECH off contract 400.00 your dreaming more like 700900 dollars is more sensible..

ZONEofTECH I will BUY S4... JUST TO MESS with APPLE fan boys...
ZONEofTECH Samsung sucks !! Dun update yr galaxy s3 to jelly bean ....as soon as u do the phone will soon die a sudden death .... The software has a bug tat fucks the mother board !! N it dies ... N the worst part is that Samsung is shameless enough to not rectify the fault or brave enough to accept its fault .... Even after numerous articles of it on the web .....of the gs3 sudden death issue !!! I had the same problem n even my phone is under warranty !! ...Samsung told me tat my phone was water logged
ZONEofTECH And apple falls behind in tjis amazing would he ever make it to the finish...?
ZONEofTECH All those popups are annoying.
ZONEofTECH So Samsung takes their existing s3 does the metal, does the performance upgrade, does the slightly bigger screen  fuck yeah win! So iphone does the metal back, does the performance upgrade, does the bigger screen.  fucking gay. Youtubers logic. Priceless..
ZONEofTECH I seen this when I go to the mall and watch the trailer
ZONEofTECH APPLE SUCKS DICK PLAN AND SIMPLE!!!!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH jebronijeb Are you stupid or just some 12 year old?! Apple makes things we ve all seen before and tries to make them sound new for example  panorama shots  btw Apple makes simple products for the less tech caring crowd. Android is for people who want their phone to be powerful, yet customisable. And 13 Mega Pixel camera thats simply amazing for a mobile. Not to forget ur iPhone 5 is only 8MP... And Expensive price tag who cares its about the same as an iPhone 5 but it delivers More! Fan boy..
ZONEofTECH cant wait till the real features n pix of the phone come out.. tired of rumors and fake ass pictures of the phone
ZONEofTECH Cant wait birthday coming up parents getting me one hopefully
ZONEofTECH hey you toddler! dont assume which side I am! my point si samsdung gaylaxy shits is copying apple stratey which means apple is shitting also. at least apple having reasonable price than samdung plastics lagdroids ! but apple are just too expensive not practical. but cheap lagdroids u arent satisfied also when using it!
ZONEofTECH Stupid little girl trying to steal my galaxy s4
ZONEofTECH yer 3rd commet. i cant wait untill it comes out thumbs up if u like the samsunggalaxy 4 comes out :)
ZONEofTECH Wait till he opens the box and finds out someone sent him his dead pet.
ZONEofTECH YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH This game is way better than the Need for Speed: Most Wanted remake, that game is fucking terrible, repetitive and just complete crap, the remake of NFS:MW is a game based on just graphics :
ZONEofTECH play.google.comstoreappsdetails?idcom.ea.games.r3rowfeaturesearchresult?tW251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5lYS5nYW1lcy5yM19yb3ciXQ
ZONEofTECH Well yes since its free!!
ZONEofTECH Pretty interesting And worth downloading to see the graphics But I doubt its worth using ur money to buy all the extra stuff cause it would than be hard to keep up
ZONEofTECH i think i want to hate the game
ZONEofTECH simply the best game ever add me via game centre peeps lcam80
ZONEofTECH wow pretty impresive almost looks as good as need for speed most wanted on ps vita
ZONEofTECH i want it for android
ZONEofTECH It not really free becuz u have to buy stuff in game anyways
ZONEofTECH I PLAY LOLOLOL SO MANY TIME
ZONEofTECH Look at you guys, orgasming at this games graphics. The only thing you talk about RR3 is graphics graphics graphics. PC level? FAR FAR AWAY. You didnt even say if its fun! Seriously, most cringeworthy review. GRAPHICS GRAPHICS.
ZONEofTECH What graphics is that at 3:47 ?? lol
ZONEofTECH I think the Samsung Galaxy S4 is going to be almost identical as the GS3, but with a bigger screen, more powerful CPU and more ram. And a 13 MP camera as well.
ZONEofTECH Better than the S3 and iPhone 5 for sure. Not sure about the specs though.
ZONEofTECH Really? :) Well Im not :) Anyway, thanks (I think).
ZONEofTECH Holy Fuck. Im a Nintendo Fan. But Holy shit,this is amazing.
ZONEofTECH I am excited for the PS4 but still i do hope the Games start taking advantage of the Power of the system. Not Necessarily Graphics. But the ability to be able to do more within the Gameplay. What im seeing of the PS4 is giving me this impression but i do hope it follows through :)
ZONEofTECH lol i agree that ps4 is great and everything but the ps3s system can do much better then this even the xbox can do better ( the developrs still didnt use the full potentel of the ps3 )
ZONEofTECH looks like killzone 3 first off, have you ever played killzone 3? The graphics compared to this far more different, in K3 you can tell they used an paint look, in this its way different, I hope this is actual gameplay and not a false one, cause this looks great
ZONEofTECH there is nothing special about this video
ZONEofTECH Microsoft will never be the front runner of nextgen games. It just cant happen anymore. PS is giving such a hard showing.
ZONEofTECH Cant say this looks better than COD graphics from XBOX 360 or PS3
ZONEofTECH The new xbox will most likely top 164 GB per second
ZONEofTECH Graphics look amazing, but the AI appear to be dumb as shit. Multiple times the character just walks past enemies with no reaction at all from them. Graphics are good, but dont gorget about the other stuff (AI, animations, story, gameplay, etc...)
ZONEofTECH ps4 actually they have the actual console but it just a box they are designing it
ZONEofTECH they have the console they are just designing how it looks because it just a dull box now
ZONEofTECH AWESOME but I like the Wii U better lol fanboy alert
ZONEofTECH I got hardware issues with Civilization 1 on my pentium when i was kid, and i play time to time mario on 8bit Nintendo. What would you like about that if gaming companys would have ended graphics evolution 20 yeas ago. Same is with future generations, they also want fresh graphics with Battlefield 10... So PC still have to lead in future, UHD is coming.
ZONEofTECH they all suck pc has superior graphics than any console right now way better than this its cost more but its worth it you can have triple monitor 3d nvidia surround you can have infinite fps and better graphics consoles dont do that all consoles have old hardware even ps4 this is the type of stuff pc can do h t t p s:w w w.youtube.comwatch?vKGgZfiSKoow
ZONEofTECH this doesnt seem like a big step up to me, and the gameplay looks as bad as killzone 3s single player (tho the online was fun)
ZONEofTECH Guerilla really has a way of releasing their titles that push the graphics from their previous leading title by tenfold. They really put work into all that is to make it LOOK good, but sometimes their mechanics and gameplay falls short against the graphics side and it stays mediocre. From the looks of this demo, Im REALLY pumped for some highkicker action gameplay and some serious multiplayer experiences. Keep it coming, Guerilla.
ZONEofTECH I dont give a flippity fu if PCs graphics are better. This is phenomenal for a console. I am definitely going to buy one when it goes cheaper.
ZONEofTECH xbox 360 could do this right now
ZONEofTECH Lies and slander. Go home fanboy.
ZONEofTECH Honestly, not impressed. Yes, its rendering a ton of stuff at any given time, but something very close to this can already be achieved using current gen systems and skilled developers. The really breath taking graphics will come later on the PS4 life cycle.
ZONEofTECH the ps4 hasnt come out yet. this looks like ps3
ZONEofTECH its just a demo they are still working on it but true
ZONEofTECH What if your fucking wrong and dont be a bitch db
ZONEofTECH If the graphics are better in the PS4 Im changing to it. But Microsoft has a better economy than Sony, they could possibly have better so never call upon victory when its not clear.
ZONEofTECH Haha :))))) thats some ! EPIC profile picture! Cheers mate!
ZONEofTECH You are right! XBOX could play back a video of this right now.
ZONEofTECH Assassins zone liberation
ZONEofTECH haha your profile pic looks like your mum
ZONEofTECH oh sweet jesus i need this now
ZONEofTECH Let me correct it for you, PC could do this right now.
ZONEofTECH Insane depth of field ... Nothing we havent seen before in other games....
ZONEofTECH haha bull shit xbox and ps3 could never dream of getting these detailed and amazing graphics. realtime reflections on every piece of glass , no tricks like fake mapped shadows or 2D enviroment everything modeled , tesselated and shadows like fucking amazing... not to mention the fully interactive volumetric particle system which would blow your xbox to shit. enough said ?
ZONEofTECH Looks like kill zone 3 from ps3
ZONEofTECH My mate goes that his dad got it for him from china
ZONEofTECH When does this come out? Or has it come out already???
ZONEofTECH It will defiantly have a gyroscope and a FaceTime camera. Apple prompted everyone else with the nano to make smart watches
ZONEofTECH How do you guys know there is comming an iWatch?
ZONEofTECH Apple on twitter just blogged that the iWatch WILL be waterproof! (Tyler Eckert) it will have a special screen but not retina display, because it would take forever to make a waterproof retina display it seems pretty easy but its not. Its considered as a techy Smartwatch. Also ZoneOfTech It wont be charged by it self, it has a cable to be put in, so read more about it on twitter, facebook instagram and iNews . And also this video was made 3 month ago the talk about it was made 1 month ago!!
ZONEofTECH this thing is better than a finding a 100 dollar bill on the ground
ZONEofTECH Honestly, there isnt a need for retina display. U are not going to watch videos or whatever on it.
ZONEofTECH Rumour that there using a new tecnology called willow glass or something like that
ZONEofTECH Never get in a fight.
ZONEofTECH for the i watch r they going to have like 8 gb models or 16 gb model?
ZONEofTECH It would like Cool and elegant watch
ZONEofTECH I think that I would look cool
ZONEofTECH how much they will ask for it? (price) :) thanks alot if you try a chance
ZONEofTECH thanks for your info.
ZONEofTECH ipod tocuch with out the app strote
ZONEofTECH I think It will have FaceTime, an adjustable wristband and a 4 inch screen display
ZONEofTECH it would look like a high tech rolex watch
ZONEofTECH it is going to be and look like a watch !! :)
ZONEofTECH You people just need to get galaxy gear and buy Samsung devices
ZONEofTECH What you all become when keep falling for those predictable marketing tricks where with cheap materials and production they sell you oveerexpensive iColud. or in other words: 90 percent status and 10 percent product. All to become 1 thing: An iSlave. No further comment.
ZONEofTECH its going to look like the pic you have when you mentioned the pulse rate thing and mate i really hop this comes out so excited :D :D :D
ZONEofTECH I think it will cost 200 and be 1and a half inches in width and 1 inch in length
ZONEofTECH it might be slim and curvy
ZONEofTECH Very nice video my friend! Actual purchase decisions should not be made until Apple officially announces an iWatch... ZONEofTECH is providing a source for all rumors and unconfirmed information all in one place for those who are curious and want their new apple products info fix. If you do not like someones video, or how they present themselves... do not watch it, and more importantly DONT BE MEAN!!!   I Am happilly a subscriber and look forward to more of your videos!!!
ZONEofTECH If i get this haha instead of a smartphone in school!
ZONEofTECH it will be pretty awesome and look pretty cool too
ZONEofTECH this i watch is going to be 16 gb and waterproof, scratch proof and 450 dollars in us
ZONEofTECH Revealed when it hasnt come out yet? Hows that possible, true that these things might have it. But guess what!! There still guesses, why dont you start every sentence with It might have or even this watch may have because thats all you doing. Is guessing at the end of the day, smart guessing with other people reports. But still guessing, just wait for the thing to come out...if it ever comes out
ZONEofTECH Answer: Like pink fluffy unicorns dancing on rainbows!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH Going to be awesome and look amazing ...
ZONEofTECH I think its gonna look like the one in the box and i think it will be awesome!!!!
ZONEofTECH I think the iWatch will be purplr and shoot lazerz! :O
ZONEofTECH He asid dingle dork pay more attention, It will be water proof
ZONEofTECH Apples going after watch companies now. sue em apple sue them.
ZONEofTECH And how would you know?
ZONEofTECH He is going to lok like on that pictures you show hehe :)
ZONEofTECH probably not going to have oled screen, tim cook hates them
ZONEofTECH Im gonna buy this shit if 150
ZONEofTECH that looks really nice  cool too. maybe you could video chat on it like that dick tracy watch :P
ZONEofTECH Dude, stop trying to profit from misguided people. THE iWATCH ISNT REAL (YET). I would be more forgiving if you SAID it was fake and a concept. angryface
ZONEofTECH What. iPod touchs cant get Siri but this piece of shit can
ZONEofTECH amazing video. by the way if apple did not release it, how did you know how it would look like?
ZONEofTECH they will prob make a belt in the future
ZONEofTECH is it possible to unlock a simlock on iphone 4s ios6.1.3 with jailbreak
ZONEofTECH i almost fell asleep with this dude. really boring.
ZONEofTECH but i think that it dont have siri
ZONEofTECH man im beginning to think that i wont be able to listen to any music on it J:, i wanted it to go jogging...and i thought id be able to connect my wireless bluetooth headphones
ZONEofTECH I highly doubt theyd integrate anything like this... Am I the only one who realizes they have already manufactured waterproof datapower ports...?
ZONEofTECH I think it will be square and super thin curved a bit waterproof the arm band will be hi gloss have a cam for facetime
ZONEofTECH I wear a gold Rolex watch that does exactly what I want it to do...tell me the time and the date and it looks good on my arm...another thing a watch should do. This thing looks like it should be free in a box of Cracker Jacks. So the answer to your question What will the iwatch be.....a disaster for Apple. I think I may unload a portion of my shares this week just watching this video. This is not Thinking Different it is not thinking at all.
ZONEofTECH This has been one of the first videos I have watched where I was like get to the point! blah blah blah blah blah.
ZONEofTECH i think that it will be rectangle in shape with various colours and it might have a built in camera
ZONEofTECH This one will be the Most fascinating of the whole range from Apple
ZONEofTECH can it make phone call like my watch phone i have now
ZONEofTECH people are gonna say that your crazy if you talk to your watch
ZONEofTECH Thats exactly what I said in the video.... Its going to charge itself wireless....pay more attention
ZONEofTECH maybe the charging is done by the gyroscope that is inside the watch...they all ready have made that kind of watches, my dad has one of these....
ZONEofTECH it will look like the ipod nano 6th generation but bigger and can go on the internet to check mail and stuff
ZONEofTECH It is going to look the sme as every thing else and I bet it will com with keyboard
ZONEofTECH im not really sure maby since its a i watch it will look like a watch
ZONEofTECH I like how he talks in these kinds of videos
ZONEofTECH Whats next, playing GTA 5 in a watch?
ZONEofTECH Damn this is a waste of time. You spend half the vid jabbering on and on about stuff completely unrelated to the subject
ZONEofTECH What happens when it rains when you have this on
ZONEofTECH Its going to look like iPad mini and I think itll have an LED flash on the front too to notify anything new on your iPhone.
ZONEofTECH Often times the engineers release blueprints or even parts of products before they are announced for a hefty bit of cash on the side. Thats how they knew so much about the iPhone 5 before its announcement for example.
ZONEofTECH just buy a used nano 6g.
ZONEofTECH awesome thats what it will be
ZONEofTECH hi cqn you help me unleash my iphone 4g from my mobile network because it is lock with the mobile network
ZONEofTECH so you are announcing that Sony announced the announcement for the PS4. Announception. We have to go deeper...
ZONEofTECH The one u showed on screen
ZONEofTECH lol im gonna buy ps4 but ive never even played ps3, i guess its gonna be a big step for me.
ZONEofTECH To let u know thats not the real ps4 its a fake
ZONEofTECH Its going to be more angularblocky, and be a POWERHOUSE!!!!!
ZONEofTECH Probably a little like the 3 but more curves and it will still use the XMB but updated kinda like how IOS updates stuff.
ZONEofTECH Yes, I will jailbreak my iPhone because I want more freedom.
ZONEofTECH Haha i do! Im just really busy with school and everything that i dont have the time to watch alot lol but good video!
ZONEofTECH Awesome to hear that :) ! Didnt know you were still watching my videos.

ZONEofTECH Dude, imm going to buy and download windows 8.1 for my late 2013 retina 13 inch macbook running OSX Mavericks (10.9.2). Im doing this because there are games id like to play but i need windows for my mac in order to do so. Will i be able to switch back to MacOSX Mavericks from windows 8 if i wanted to? Or is my mac stuck in windows 8 unless i delete it? Id be so totally grateful if you could answer my question x)
ZONEofTECH my bootcamp doesnt look like that..
ZONEofTECH how do i get my hands on a free windwos 8? is there a link some one can give me. please!thanks!
ZONEofTECH Because macs usually have really good specs and you might want to game on it..macs dont support a lot of games though
ZONEofTECH when i go to bootcamp it says no disc found, what should i do ?
ZONEofTECH If you were using your Mac mainly for Windows, how big can you make the Windows partition? Can you make it 7080 of the total drive space?
ZONEofTECH will it make your mac slower or shorten battery life?
ZONEofTECH Why not just buy a windows pc instead of paying over a 1000 and then installing it on it
ZONEofTECH my says macintosh hd is that ok
ZONEofTECH does your MacBook get a bit more warm in bootcamp and when your playing games do the fans speed up?
ZONEofTECH Im going to get wind 8
ZONEofTECH The drivers are not in my flash drive what should I do?
ZONEofTECH do you loose all your programs and all your stuff
ZONEofTECH How did you turn on weather info on the bar?
ZONEofTECH Fuck no, because its horrable!
ZONEofTECH Does anybody know which is better bootcamp or paralles to have this setup? I bought paralles already without knowing I could do it this way. Can somebody give me any input on this id appriciate it thx
ZONEofTECH Does it work on Mavericks ?
ZONEofTECH The Windows Support cant install with Win8, any suggestion?
ZONEofTECH Isnt it possible to completely use the whole ssd drive for my windows? I dun even need macos so i wouldnt care
ZONEofTECH I have free disk space 29 gigabytes, will it be enough?
ZONEofTECH just follow this video?just click install window 7 directly or click creat a window 7 first?
ZONEofTECH Yep i got windows 8.1,(clevo w350st)
ZONEofTECH Will you still be able to switch between Mac and windows or is it permanently windows
ZONEofTECH Do I have Windows 8? Yes I have Windows 8.1 on my PC  I hate it so much that Im switching to Mac. Do I plan on buying Windows 8? Id never waste my money on such a terrible operating system  even if I had a copy of it, I wouldnt instal it on my Mac.
ZONEofTECH hey mine says i have to insert the ISO image
ZONEofTECH Awesome and helpful video, i just have a question. Does it work on Mavericks?Can you make a video using Mavericks. Thank you so much!
ZONEofTECH What are the benefits of installing wondows on a mac?
ZONEofTECH I has windows 8! It is very very good sir.
ZONEofTECH what about OX Mavericks
ZONEofTECH Does this work on Mavricks ?
ZONEofTECH can u help im run mavericks 10.9.2 on my macbook air 2013.i cant installed windows 8 on in. i have download all the support of windows 8 for apple but when i continue the step to install windows 8 it will ask me the iso image but i dont have that is were im stuck. can u make video for that or tell what to do
ZONEofTECH Ok so i got into some shit and I ejected the disk . Now it telling me to insert a boot disk . Wat now how do I get out of this
ZONEofTECH does windows 8 overheat the mac when you run games like windows 7? thats the reason i uninstall windows 7 from my mac
ZONEofTECH manno install windows 8 on mac mini, mac book pro and airno spaceon my imac 24 inch its recmoandedwindows 8 its installed on 100 gb on my imac
ZONEofTECH dont use boot camp, get a parallel version from the Apple store, get the windows 8 full version disc and you are ready to go, it takes 10 min. You can use SO X and Windows 8 on your iMac. Dont use boot camp, its too complicated and if you dont know what you are doing, you gonna mess it up, trust me. there is an easier way :)
ZONEofTECH installing windows on mac is such a foolish thing one can ever do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ZONEofTECH I just bought my first MacBook Pro (15 retina). Last apple computer was Performance 6400. Yes, its been awhile. After that experience I went back to PCs and didnt leave until owning every version of iPhone and iPad created. After falling in love with these products I decided to try the MacBook Pro but I dont want to be completely Windows free so Im going to install Windows 8. I was concerned as to the ease of installation but this video has erased that fear. Thank you. I am now a subscribed viewer. :)
ZONEofTECH i finally am able to load windows and my cad program.. I had to repeat steps 34x, but it did all work and I am grateful.. and subscribed for future issues.. thank you!!!

ZONEofTECH I hate windows 8, I will use windows 7 till the day it becomes so out of date it useless! i did try it i installed it on my pc to see what it would be like, was allot faster then windows 7, that was nice. And thats the only good thing I have to say...i hate the interface in every way. i want my real desktop and start menu that i have been using since windows 95. i have realized that Im a releic now it seems in the computer world and everyone else is starting to move on. but i still make my desktop like windows 982000! i add the my computer icon and my documents and all that other stuff just like windows was back then.... maybe i have problems idk but i dont like change and i dont want my computer turning into a smart phone thats for sure! and Mac OS is scaring me to. I have a feeling 10.9 is the last OS X 10 i bet the next one will be like OS X 11.0 and will be like a iPhone or iPad...... im scared!!!!! :(

ZONEofTECH Can you go back to the regular Mac Home screen and then go back to windows?
ZONEofTECH Hi Zone of Tech: I need help :) I been working on installing windows 8 on my Mac. Spec of equipment:Mac Book Pro Mid 2012 Bootcamp Version: Version 5.0.4 (473) Bootable USB Flash Drive: Type Scan disk 4 GB windows 8 pro iso image but without the driver and the 2nd Scan disk USB flash drive with 32 GB with the Bootcamp Drivers downloaded and saved to this drive. Please Note: I also have the original back up installation disc for Microsoft 8 Prof 64 from Microsoft where I purchased it from. 1st Bootcamp is not recognizing the Original Microsoft 8 Pro backup disk from microsoft itself. Solution: I created the New Image from the Original Microsoft installed disc in my desk top and changed the extension to .ISO then burned the ISO image into the newly purchased DVDR. Then I ran Bootcamp Once again and it get the following error message The installer disc could not be found  Insert your Windows installer disc and wait a few seconds for the disc to be recognized. Solution 2: Created a bootable usb drive with bootcamp assistant successfully with bootcamp. Yes I close, ejected or unmounted any image that was open or had been previously used then i restarted the Mac. Next, I start the bootcamp assistant tool once again then i get the same insert your windows installer disc message. 3: Then I try to resolve the installer disc not found issue: this are the steps i took: a). Lauch disc utilities   1. Selected the top most drive 750 GB Macintosh HDD   2. On the right youll see 5 tab buttons: First Aid  Erase  Partition  RAID  Restore.   3. Choose Partition. Then I clicked  to add another partition size of the partition was 222 GB   4. Change the Name of the Partition to BOOTCAMP   5. Change the Format to MSDOS (FAT)   6. Click Apply to save the changes and then reboot your Mac and well begin Windows installation.   7. During reboot, press and hold the altOption key and youll be presented with drives to boot from.   8. Use the arrow keys and return button to select the Windows yellow USB key drive containing your Windows 8 installation files.   9. This will begin the Windows install.  then i get the following message: Booting from Boot Camp Assistant created USB Drive...Failed to load BOOTMGR.4: Take the Mac to best buy and let them resolve the issue and charge me like a million dollars for it :( since i have no other idea who to get this bootcamp working at all. This has been a terribly lengthy issue and it is not as simple as it is claimed to be since i started with the Original Windows Disc Purchased from Microsoft and I have the Optical disc drive which it should be simpler from what I understand. Please can you help It would be of great help. :)my email is jramirez0801yahoo.com

ZONEofTECH Nice video, but I have a question. This question might sound pretty retarded but anyway. I am going to buy the Windows 8 installation cd But I got confused, because the product usually named Win 8 Pro Upgrade and my question is when it an upgrade version, can I still use it to install Windows 8 on my Macbook even if I never ever have installed Windows on my Mac, because I found some really cheap ones when the Products name is Windows 8 Pro Upgrade rather than the expensive ones  Windows 8 Pro. So what would you guys suggest me to do? really need help. (btw Sorry if my english is so bad)
ZONEofTECH No, but I will install it from this video

ZONEofTECH iPad 5 is now iPad air and it does not look anything like that
ZONEofTECH Can you do a video when ipad5 come out
ZONEofTECH I have the ipad air and everything you mostly said was wrong
ZONEofTECH Take this down I agree with ASXON9
ZONEofTECH I have the ipad 5 ( air ) . So some of the informations are very wrong.
ZONEofTECH This is the most fakes thing in my life . Guys wait when u see the new I pad on tv
ZONEofTECH this video was made 2012
ZONEofTECH I dont think I want a smaller iPad
ZONEofTECH Apple needs to update its UI. Lose the home button. No mechanical buttons is the way of the future. You guys laughed at the BlackBerry PlayBook, but in reality its UI is proabaly the most modern.
ZONEofTECH If you make iPad 5 like that how can purchasers can hold it?
ZONEofTECH what the fuck this is not ture it is September you are fucking lieing u big fucking asshole
ZONEofTECH thisnwas posted on christmas day,... 10 years ago
ZONEofTECH this is fake krong date
ZONEofTECH you mean iphone5. get your facts straight.
ZONEofTECH To all the people who disliked the video because of the inaccurate March release date 1) The video has been made in December of 2012 (yeah! more than half a year ago). Back in December, March was believed to be the release date for the iPad 5. 2) Everything I said in the video (except from the release date and possibly the A7 CPU) is going to be true. This means: iPad Mini design slight increase in speed same price same battery life same 163264128 gb capacities
ZONEofTECH DELETE THIS VIDEO AND REDO IT AGAIN.
ZONEofTECH the allnew iPad 5, running on the 2011 iOS 5 software
ZONEofTECH THIS IS JUNE MOTHAFUCKA HOW YOU DOIN?
ZONEofTECH Its June and only the iPad 3 has come out... And its a confirmed quote that you said  I am not making any of this up I have many sources
ZONEofTECH If only the iPad 5 supports Phonecalls.....i guess that would be handy...
ZONEofTECH THEY WILL HAVE A IPAD5 BUT HIS SPECS IS SO OFF. THE SIZE WILL PROBABLY BE THE SAME. KNOW YOUR STUFF FIRST BEFORE YOU POST SOMETHING.
ZONEofTECH This was posted on Christmas Day
ZONEofTECH Is my time wrong or is that 7 months ago?
ZONEofTECH iPad 4 is out too....
ZONEofTECH yea but apple hasnt even said anything 8
ZONEofTECH you tell him zone lol its april and apple hasnt mentioned an ipad from my perspective i see it around this time next year
ZONEofTECH It will be like the iPhone 5 but bigger and mb a bit more powerful.I mean itll have the same design style as iPhone 5.
ZONEofTECH This was posted on Christmas Day
ZONEofTECH Is my time wrong or is that 7 months ago?
ZONEofTECH iPad 4 is out too....
ZONEofTECH Its April and no talk from Apple for a WWDC or anything as such. So yea, this video is a waste of your time...BS
ZONEofTECH yea but apple hasnt even said anything 8
ZONEofTECH To all the people who disliked the video because of the inaccurate March release date 1) The video has been made in December of 2012 (yeah! more than half a year ago).

ZONEofTECH Hahaha...when ipad 4 was going to be released videos were showing this model (the first) .....NONE OF THIS MODELS WILL BE IPAD 5 .GET FUCKING RID PF THESE STUPID IDEAS
ZONEofTECH Like the iPad 4 with I have but smaller thinner and Lighter
ZONEofTECH The dates are indeed wrong, bad sources. Other than that, all the specs are going to be exactly the same as mentioned in the video.
ZONEofTECH Its may 4.How do u explain its not here!!!!
ZONEofTECH WOOT :D haaha, I havent noticed that. :D
ZONEofTECH I am from Russia, and i dont speak English. But i know, what this iPad 5 is a fake!
ZONEofTECH Its A7 chip which contains Samsung part.
ZONEofTECH That month passes ssooo... Ya......
ZONEofTECH 1:15 this is what diffrent people from the world of technology... LMAO trying to sound too pro
ZONEofTECH it has already been march? no Ipad 5 so I guess your rumors were wrong.

ZONEofTECH Now you know thats not happening fucking amateur
ZONEofTECH You got your release date way off.
ZONEofTECH I hope ipad 5 will revealed
ZONEofTECH An expensive piece of junk.
ZONEofTECH Its MAY sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Think about ! !!! :.
ZONEofTECH Thats iPad mini you cant trick me!
ZONEofTECH Totally reliable sources considering that its been march and it w
ZONEofTECH You need to realise it IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE THE MODEL HE SHOWED! Look on HnboxTherapys channel and watch his iPad 5 video before bitching here.
ZONEofTECH Even though this might never happen, all the companies should just like come together and then they can make really GOOD touch screen electronics without any competition in the US...
ZONEofTECH A7x not A7 . A7 is for phones and ipfo touch .

ZONEofTECH Thx :) Be sure to LIKE it and SUBSCRIBE to my channel if you havent already done so. Also, please SHARE it so I can get more views, because now, I dont have that many :(
ZONEofTECH nah, I said it in the beginning :) this is actually a REunboxing, so yes. the controller was used, but by me :D By the way, please SUBSCRIBE if you enjoyed my video :) Thx swiing!
ZONEofTECH Super ultra gaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy
ZONEofTECH Its EarthNeutron Add me.
ZONEofTECH I plan on buying one in the near future? Should I get this or the new model whatever is called?
ZONEofTECH gayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
ZONEofTECH the ps4 is out in 2014 with the next xbox is out next year i dont think they will be released at the same time like the last gen the xbox 360 was released in 2005 wile ps3 was released a year later or two years if you lived i europe the one i dont want is another red or yellow light of death.
ZONEofTECH what is the name of your account (psn id)
ZONEofTECH haha dude u got a used controller
ZONEofTECH The yellow light of death was fixed with the release of the Playstation 3 slim. The overheating was causing it and the new design focused more on better air circulation throughout the system. I am not sure about the ps3 being released after the Xbox 720, only because Sony had a lot to lose from the Xbox 360 being released before their PS3 (in 2005). So maybe sony will release the ps4 before the new Xbox just to prevent what happened with the ps3 back in 06.
ZONEofTECH Grey looks the best ! Way better than the blue one
ZONEofTECH Yeah, I know. Thats why I bought it in the 1st place. BTW thx for commenting on my last 3 videos:) Cheers mate
ZONEofTECH I had to look at this with the iPhone 6 coming in about 6 months (if Apple continues with their current release schedule). Not a single thing predicted about the 5s was correct in this video. lol
ZONEofTECH iPhone 5s looks like its gonna be sweet!
ZONEofTECH Apple hasnt confirmed a thing....5S will most likely be their next iPhone. If Apple wouldve confirmed something like that, I wouldve made a video of it.
ZONEofTECH Soooool.... its the end of June now hahaha WRONG
ZONEofTECH The S stands for sucky battery.
ZONEofTECH 3g 3g 3gs 3g  scompass see what i did there?
ZONEofTECH I think iPhone 5s will have the same exterior looks (some rear may take place) , but there will lot of changes in the performance and software .
ZONEofTECH Wow, proves how much you know...
ZONEofTECH People who buy iPhone: OMG! The new iPhone is gonna have a better camera. People will think they actually are looking at what im eating on instagram. MUST UPGRADE Android:The screen has only been made 0.5 bigger, and 13 mp isnt much of and improvement. But I like the fact that I dont have to touch to the phone to use it. Meh not worth the upgrade
ZONEofTECH why are there samsung adverts
ZONEofTECH its past the date and its not out stupedface
ZONEofTECH The iPhone 5S is going to be the last project from Steve Jobs ):
ZONEofTECH They need to make the iPhone 5s a lil bigger like 4.5 or 4.7 inches
ZONEofTECH I just ordered the i phone 5 yesterday, what should I do? I want the 5S. I mean, why not?
ZONEofTECH Well its been released and confirmed. We have the iPhone 5Same and the iPhone 5Crap. See you have learnt from the past Apple. RIP
ZONEofTECH Well if they wanna beat the samsunge 4s They might wanna Do alot of work
ZONEofTECH June 2013 has passed, whats your next guess for the release date?
ZONEofTECH wrong. the 5 and 5s are switched around
ZONEofTECH i really think they took it to far with by changing the icons it just dont have the emboss look anymore...
ZONEofTECH Ohhhhh ya it totally came out Im on it right now (cough) you f in liar and android is better
ZONEofTECH samsung gs4 for the win
ZONEofTECH Clock is ticking dude, only 18 days left...
ZONEofTECH Lmao its July and its not out its not true.....
ZONEofTECH STFU retard! He makes the best videos on YouTube. Except from the release date everything will most likely turn out to be true! YOU should quit YouTube you 12 year old piece of shit!
ZONEofTECH are there still people waiting for the iphones? thank you for the review. nice review. but waiting for a new iphone? not really. i seriously think its already pase, a lot of great phones out there
ZONEofTECH Isnt super HD the same as 4k? If so I will shit bricks.
ZONEofTECH Made up on the spot for money
ZONEofTECH I like apple but lets face it they never improve the battery
ZONEofTECH i think it is going to be the same thing as it antessesor
ZONEofTECH What the fuck is going on with you people. When youre going to understand that the s stands for speed!!!! That means the every version that has the s mark means that, that model is faster than the previous.
ZONEofTECH most likely 128 GB will be available for the iphone 5S
ZONEofTECH WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG. Apple has Airdrop, so no NFC. iPhone 5S is coming out in October.
ZONEofTECH Its june right now! i dont see any iphones comign up...
ZONEofTECH this is nothing on spec the new iphone is a confirmed iPhone 5s it runs a quadcore a7 chip also running a m7 chip theres major improvements like a finger scanner witch lets you set your fingerthumb print as your password many other improvements but you lot aint worth the time it would take to explain
ZONEofTECH The new ifone will be came in sell in the next year becose ifone 5 is the best on the markets so the will be waiting for the  so you have to waiting for 1 year
ZONEofTECH This is a lie apple said its coming out fall 2013
ZONEofTECH i think it is going to be the same thing as it antessesor
ZONEofTECH Thats what they always say until the 6 comes out
ZONEofTECH What the fuck is going on with you people. When youre going to understand that the s stands for speed!!!! That means the every version that has the s mark means that, that model is faster than the previous.
ZONEofTECH I think the iPhone 5S is gonna be the same sht as the iPhone 5
ZONEofTECH most likely 128 GB will be available for the iphone 5S
ZONEofTECH WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG. Apple has Airdrop, so no NFC. iPhone 5S is coming out in October.
ZONEofTECH Its june right now! i dont see any iphones comign up...
ZONEofTECH its just gona be all like, hey we have a iphone five but we changed 2 things so now its a iphone 5s
ZONEofTECH this is nothing on spec the new iphone is a confirmed iPhone 5s it runs a quadcore a7 chip also running a m7 chip theres major improvements like a finger scanner witch lets you set your fingerthumb print as your password many other improvements but you lot aint worth the time it would take to explain
ZONEofTECH The new ifone will be came in sell in the next year becose ifone 5 is the best on the markets so the will be waiting for the  so you have to waiting for 1 year
ZONEofTECH Just calm down, no one took it offensivly
ZONEofTECH I think its going to be a little bit taller than the iphone 5 and i think it will come in more colors
ZONEofTECH Shut up Jorge. Dont say that to another person. Dan is only speaking his opinion. What if he will do it? YOU will be held responsible. Damn people these days are fucking crazy. I cant believe no one else said this to you, but 17 other people liked what you said. You and all those are people are SICK.
ZONEofTECH i think it will be similar
ZONEofTECH This is a lie apple said its coming out fall 2013
ZONEofTECH Fk the Iphone!! I want a Chuck Norris camera!!
ZONEofTECH ost of new apple products come out in fallm
ZONEofTECH the icons have a lower quality actually
ZONEofTECH I dont think its going to come in colors until iPhone 6 but if it does it definitely not those colors those are those icolor things
ZONEofTECH good video ...please get rid of the selfpromoting ads
ZONEofTECH oh yea forgot about that but still people will be mad if they dont call it 6
ZONEofTECH So far, only iOS 7 has been revealed at the WWDC. I think maybe, theyre either gonna wait for next year for the 5s or release it at a sooner date of September
ZONEofTECH I think the iphone 5s will be a really big upgrade and make history by selling out in less than an hour.
ZONEofTECH Stupid video.. I dont know if this guy got to know that iOS 7 beta is released two days back
ZONEofTECH none of those pictures have 7.0 because i have it on my phone and it looks nothing like that
ZONEofTECH Dude come down! If he enjoys making videos, she should do it :)
ZONEofTECH i was just saying :) im sorry :)
ZONEofTECH i think the iphone 5s needs to beat the samsung 4s because most people are getting them now
ZONEofTECH it will be called myPhone
ZONEofTECH hey. its june, you better hope they reveal at the event tomorrow
ZONEofTECH There is nothing to support the theory that iPhone 5S will be released at WWDC in June. In recent years WWDC has been a forum to introduce IOS upgrades and secondary consumer products. Following this trend it is more likely that they will keep to their Fall release format, especially considering we have a new body design that has been in the market for less than a year.
ZONEofTECH yeah but can you make a phone call with it ??
ZONEofTECH how MP could be that camera ?
ZONEofTECH Its going to be a total redesigned
ZONEofTECH Its August now, so that was wrong.. So its safe to say the rest of the video is wrong too.
ZONEofTECH Here is what I HATE (yes HATE!) about their new and crappy version of iTunes...I spent MONTHS finding original and rare album covers for singles for thousands of songs which could be displayed with the cover flow, which made iTunes LOOK LIKE a virtual jukebox (actually way better). Now...I get a tiny picture. My music library now looks like CRAP. The new iTunes SUCKS! I make playlists and if I click a song, that song and ONLY THAT SONG plays?!?!?! I have to select all the songs in the playlist for it to play?!?!? What is a playlist for? Play the damn songs!SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS!Your presentation didnt address any of these problems.
ZONEofTECH i cant find the sync button!
ZONEofTECH Also, way to NOT manage the levels in your review. I turn up the volume to hear the commentary and every time you play a song, it blows my eardrums out while Im listening on headphones.
ZONEofTECH Cool :D I will feature your comment in the next video then. Cheers :)
ZONEofTECH The icon is my favorite feature!
ZONEofTECH i hate the ipod song managing in the new update
ZONEofTECH I DONT LIKE ITUNES 11
ZONEofTECH What if i dont want to sync and just ant to add
ZONEofTECH well this is cool I got a free iTunes Card Code and it was valid! Crazy! Check this site out: freeitunesforever com
ZONEofTECH Is cover flow even available on iTunes 11?
ZONEofTECH Thanks for the review!
ZONEofTECH Did you watch the entire 17min video to answer the QODV or did you read it in the description box :D? Im just curious because I think the video is way too long for someone to watch. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH Go to FILEIMPORT and select your folder, to import music, or simply drag the folder into iTunes. To view songs on your iPhone, connect your iPhone to your computer, and click the iPhone button on the top right corner. Then simply go to On My iPhone tab to view your content stored on your iPhone. I hope this was helpful :) Please SUBSCRIBE to my channel and like this video in order to help me as well :) Cheers wlandaverde83 :D!
ZONEofTECH Ops, I forgot to mention this feature :( When you connect your iPhone to iTunes 11, an iPhone icon will appear in the TOP RIGHT CORNER. And by clicking that icon, you will be able to sync or iPhone as before.
ZONEofTECH What OS are you using?
ZONEofTECH fuck you appel. you guys fuck up every fucking shit after steve jobs gone!!!!!

ZONEofTECH I didnt watch your whole video but the check boxes are gone as well. you now have to right click checkuncheck selection in order to use that feature
ZONEofTECH How do you view album art, view your entire library of music, and see all of your play lists at once? the Previous iTunes could do that, this one looks like making playlists is tedious.
ZONEofTECH nope, its not there unfortunately :(
ZONEofTECH First comment!!!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH And why is that? I honestly think iTunes 11 is the best iTunes yet.
ZONEofTECH how do i delete a song in itunes 11 please help me?

ZONEofTECH how can i get old itunes back i dont even know what version it was?
ZONEofTECH itunes is fucking with everybody becouse they know they can the people who keep changing itunes are idiots
ZONEofTECH I watched the whole video.
ZONEofTECH its not lynx its mavericks but i know that becouse i am from the future
ZONEofTECH i have windows but i am going to buy macbook air. its expensive but i really like it ,also i am afraid that apple may release macbook air with retina display in 2013 ,it would be like disaster to me. because after i buy mac 2012 i wont be able to buy another for the next five years.so tell what should i do .
ZONEofTECH It could be OS X 10.10, 10.11 etc
ZONEofTECH im using windows 8 on my pc and windows 7 on my notebook and i will switch to a macbook! i still need my windows pc!
ZONEofTECH What about OS X 10.10??
ZONEofTECH Which MacBook Air are you planning to buy? Which configuration?
ZONEofTECH windows, and I want to swich to mac
ZONEofTECH I hope that I can upgrade via Lion 10.7.5
ZONEofTECH running OSX 10.8.3 and will sure want 10.9 when it comes out
ZONEofTECH i use double windows 7 on my pc and mac os x on my mac and i would like to switch to 10.9!
ZONEofTECH Yeah I would switch i upgrade every year
ZONEofTECH OS X Mountain Lion and I never switch, only upgrade.
ZONEofTECH Why 10.6? It sucked! Mountain lion FTW!!!
ZONEofTECH Yes, its an upgrade from Lion
ZONEofTECH the thinness is very important for me but your suggestion is reasonable ill think over it.thank you very much
ZONEofTECH i am actually using mountain lion and i will switch if Lynx comes out this 2013 Summer
ZONEofTECH At first when i buyed my macbook pro I used snow leopard... and one year later I switched from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion.... and it was really cool i will switch this time just for siri because siri is really usefull for me )
ZONEofTECH Mac OS X 10.4 PPC FOR THE WIN!!!! Hopefully, if I get a summer job, I can save up enough money to buy a mackbook pro running 10.6!
ZONEofTECH i think siri will just be another button on the dock
ZONEofTECH Thx, Im glad you enjoyed my video :D Please like, share (so more people can see it ) and SUBSCRIBE to support me :D Cheers! :D
ZONEofTECH I have a question. If you update to Mac OSX lynx, what kind of background will you get?
ZONEofTECH IM ALREADY ON MAC AND NEVER GOING TO SWITCH!!
ZONEofTECH Windows, Mac OS 10.8, Linux, Android, and IOS
ZONEofTECH OSX 10.7 is amazing! I am quite happy with it.
ZONEofTECH Hope it can be upgrade on mid 15 inch 2012 mbp, because I gonna buy it!!!!
ZONEofTECH Hmm..its a damn good configuration. HOWEVER, I suggest buying the 13 inch MBP and upgrading the RAM to 8GB and the HDD to an SSD. Youll pay half the price you paid for the Air. I dont think the thinness is forth paying that price.
ZONEofTECH I use Mac OSX Mountain Lion and I am never going to switch
ZONEofTECH Using my late 2012 base line iMac and also my 11inch mid 2011 MacBook Air 128GB SSD Both on ML. I cannot wait for OS X 10.9 :D
ZONEofTECH i am using windows 7, mac os 9, mac os 10,4 tiger, ubuntu. see i use a lot of different computers. but i prefer mac because it just works the best. my powermac g4 quicksilver has 800 mhz and plays hd 720p videos with vlc
ZONEofTECH Hey there, cool video I am using Mac too and would of cause do the switch if my late 2006 iMac would support anything higher than 10.7. Thanks
ZONEofTECH haha :)) your comment made my day :D
ZONEofTECH Fuxk i just bought mountain lion just cuz i wanted to get the lastest
ZONEofTECH I Have Mac OS X 10.8.2 On A Mid 2012 Mac Book Air Come on Apple Release Lynx!!!
ZONEofTECH On mac OS, dont wanna switch.
ZONEofTECH Will that be upgradable from Lion?
ZONEofTECH Hmm not sure. But it will DEFINITELY be a new one, will probably have something to do with astronomy and a new colour scheme (probably a darker one) may be there.
ZONEofTECH 10.8.2 Mountain LionWin7SP1 (on my MBP) and 10.5.8 Leopard (on my 533MHz Power Mac G4 :D)
ZONEofTECH Im using Mountain Lion, Leopard, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
ZONEofTECH I use a Custom Operating System, and I will not switch.
ZONEofTECH using windows 7 ultimate, but im buying a rMBP tomorrow so.. yeah id switch xP
ZONEofTECH mac osx 10.8.3, and Ill be one of the first to get 10.9, I bought Mountain Lion the day it came out, right after watching the keynote... I used to have windows, but once I got a Mac, I cound never go without one. I do have parallels desktop, but I always prefer to just use the Mac OS.
ZONEofTECH im using mac osx 10.8.3 and would love to see Lynx when its out
ZONEofTECH I use my own operating system called MNJ it is the best you guys can get a iso copy just email me at mitchellcarsgmail.com
ZONEofTECH siri will probably be an icon in the dock witch will expand like newstand or a folder in ios or launchpad
ZONEofTECH I have a macbook pro with OS X mountain lion and i will upgrade to OS X Lynx when it comes out.
ZONEofTECH Xbox 360 because its Fing PROTECTED FROM HACKERS
ZONEofTECH so the new xbox will be a gaming computer with a nintendo controller.... Microsoft, I am dissapoint!
ZONEofTECH Dont know why you hated Xbox, the multiplatform games for Xbox are way better.
ZONEofTECH I may consider getting a pc this generation
ZONEofTECH Why did they screw up the controller
ZONEofTECH even if the specs are far from what a pc today has doesnt mean it will be less powerful. consoles are static platforms and developers can precision tune their games to fully use what the consoles have, unlike the pc which forces developers to account for the trillions of hardware configuations. hell, when the 360 launched it could do everything a pc at the same time could graphically and even more in some cases. same thing will happen with next gen consoles which will catch up and surpass the pc
ZONEofTECH Well when you have 8 cores and 8 gigs of ram windows doesnt touch your resources...Fact is, they are marketing to people that dont know anything about computers, which are generally the same people who love call of duty games...tell me dillon1108 do you love call of duty games?
ZONEofTECH I want to leave comment that will help people okay the newxboxwill probably be available this year why because if you pay attention to release dates of new games coming out this year they mainly focus around novemember its only logic why else? secondly how the world eco is going if shit they wont Release ANYTHING.Come on there only in it to make money not lose it
ZONEofTECH I just looked on the site couldnt find a quad core PC for that price with 8GB of RAM, I saw an A4 APU based PC with 4GB of RAM, which would be pretty weak, wouldnt be a massive step above a PS3 in graphics. If that pc you found was just a CPU, without a GPU then youd need to spend more money to play games. Intel APUs arent great, probably weaker than a console for graphics, AMDs a different deal, their graphics arent bad in APUs. The 240 was money saved buying the PC compared to the PC.
ZONEofTECH By the way its an 8 core AMD processor at 1.6 ghz not 4 :b
ZONEofTECH Why should they make a screen on the controller?! I bearly trust my little niece with my controller now
ZONEofTECH LIE SONY MAKES BLURAY
ZONEofTECH This time do not put laser burning or when theres a disk inside the xbox and you lift and it gets screwed up
ZONEofTECH No, I hate call of duty I think its the most hideous creation of the modern world. I like games that push hardware to the limits.
ZONEofTECH A 250GB PS3 Super Slim is 260 with uncharted 3, thats almost half the price of that PC. 240 buys a lot of games today. The 500 PC wont be that much more powerful than the PS3. With next gen theyre going to be more powerful than 20056 consoles, even cheap dual cores are more powerful than cell  the 360s triple core processor put together so the cpu business isnt really an issue. GPGPU will probably play a big part, CPUs dont need to be crazy beasts, just a jump from current gen.
ZONEofTECH You got EVERY single detail wrong. I could have at least gotten one right
ZONEofTECH U a bitch u got to much water in your mouth
ZONEofTECH Oh hell no. I aint getting the new xbox if its gonna have a stupid controller.
ZONEofTECH sony doesnt own bluray, bluray is licensed and managed by the bluray disc association. anyone can become a member of it just like sony did. microsoft can place bluray drives in anything they want and sony never see a cent. do some research before you post stupid shit.
ZONEofTECH The controller looks fuckin stupid
ZONEofTECH Xbox because have halo and better graphics and faster at internet
ZONEofTECH I think someone has left a piece of there bullshit behind
ZONEofTECH I just jumped on the Best Buy website and found a Quad Core PC with 8gb of Ram (Upgradeable to 32gb) Windows 8, and a 1TB hdd with a 2.6Ghz processor for exactly 429 ! Sounds like the PC is the better deal. And last time I checked, there is no console to date that can match these specs. Heck, the Xbox 720 wont even be able to match them either! By the way, 240 sure can buy several PC games, Dozens upon dozens, just go check out Steam!!!!!
ZONEofTECH Ps4 will have gpu of Radeon hd 7670 and Xbox will use 6670 hd basically the next gen Xbox is an update for the 360 really next ooook
ZONEofTECH Ducking stupid vid the Wii u is BAD
ZONEofTECH I can here every bit of saliva moving around his mouth every time he says a word.
ZONEofTECH PCs are superior but youre pushing it when you say xbox and ps suck. Youre just trying to start a platform war like all other arrogant PC players who think theyre better than everyone else because they have the time and money to spend on a custom PC. News flash, people have better things to spend 1000 on than games. GO OUTSIDE.
ZONEofTECH I hope ur allowed to play xbox 360 games and put ur hard drive from the 360 in the 720 cuz i really dont want to start from scratch when i first got xbox live
ZONEofTECH What a bs video. The next generation of xbox HSA not yet been announced.
ZONEofTECH Intel 4 core? Lol  core for PS4
ZONEofTECH wouldnt it be awesome if it had a projector built in it
ZONEofTECH are you stupid the new xbox is not named yet and the controler is not like that
ZONEofTECH Ahhhg blu ray :O finally better drives.
ZONEofTECH Thats pretty much what all consoles are... Man.... consoles blow. Well i guess if you cant afford a computer its better. But you will never achieve the same level of gaming that you can on computer with a console.
ZONEofTECH I heard a rumor that the new Xbox will come with as screenpad for your TV or monitor. Basically you can use your hands, like an iPad, to browse the web, download music, movies, and tv shows.
ZONEofTECH Those specs sound like those on my PC...sad it took so long. I also imagine my PC is thinner and lighter than the new Xbox.
ZONEofTECH Its something called mass production. When you produce something in mass, you get tons of discounts. So the production cost is going to be around 180200 at the beginning (which means 20 profit per console), but in time the production cost will lower to bout 80100 which is the production cost of a ps3xbox 360 now.
ZONEofTECH on board speakers? if my tv doesnt have speakers. what? thats probably going to in microsoft terms jack up the price by a 100.
ZONEofTECH Why did he say that the next Xbox will be 300 dollars, the same as the current one when the current one only costs 200 dollars. Unless he is talking about Kinect included.
ZONEofTECH This guy didnt answer my question maybe someone here can... Ok does anyone know if the new Xbox will be backwards compatible with Xbox 360 games!?
ZONEofTECH are you stupid the new xbox is not named yet and the controler is not like that
ZONEofTECH Ahhhg blu ray :O finally better drives.
ZONEofTECH Look at the kinect 360 hahahhaa fool

ZONEofTECH That is a great misunderstanding from a lot of people! But the fact is that you dont need a lot of money to buy a good PC that can run the latest games. With only 500, you can buy a PC that can run all of the latest games that have been coming out on consoles. When you compare that price to the 350 that you have to spend on a console, Id say the PC would be the best choice, considering that you can also use any type of screen and adapt a controller to it as well!
ZONEofTECH So...theyre copying nintendos gamepad?
ZONEofTECH 2GB of GDDR5 seems pretty likely, probably with 2Gb of DDR3, maybe with some eDram, though a straight up 4GB of GDDR5 would probably be more desireable for devs. The 256MB of XDR in PS3 ran at 26GBs (I think the 256 of GDDR3 was like 22GBs), GDDR5 can be anything from 72GBs (at 128bit) to 240GBs (on 384Bit), this would be massive compared to whats in PS3, maybe even 2GB of GDDR5 somewhere in the middle would be fine for everything, DDR3 may not be needed.
ZONEofTECH i just want a controller that fits my hands without me even trying to grasp it.
ZONEofTECH i dont like the wii u controler idea
ZONEofTECH Considering where consoles are coming from the archetecture will be a decent step up over this current gen in performance. Its not just about the CPU, to run games with better physics  AI a modern low wattage CPU is fine for the job. Next gen consoles are never going to be as powerful as the best gaming PC, but theyll be competitive on priceperformance compared to a similarly priced PC when they come out  for a few years after. Also the amount of RAM isnt as important as speedbandwidth.
ZONEofTECH i would say yes AT FIRST to keep games and players available, then the later gens might lose compatibility as the 360 market slowly dries up. look at the 3DS, it didnt have compatibility for the original DS, so therefore when it released with only couple of games and a sketchy gimmick, many preferred to stick to the old DS(xl)
ZONEofTECH A 2 screen controller is gay
ZONEofTECH No, I was talking about the standard edition. Unfortunately it is going to be a bit more expensive at the start, since the new hardware will be more expensive than to old one, to manufacture. Same happened with the PS3 in 2006. But the price will drop after a while, thrust me. By the way, please SUBSCRIBE to my channel if you enjoyed my video :) Cheers! :D
ZONEofTECH Why does quadcore suck? its still better than dual core Radeon? no one knows that. The only thing thats for sure is the video memory, which is 2 GB. And yes, the reuse of games sucks :( I forgot to mention that in the video but both PS4 and the new Xbox will prevent you from reusingrenting a game.
ZONEofTECH Blueray drive! No way! Blueray is from sony i will be surprised if that happens
ZONEofTECH Only 4 cores and 2GB of graphics memory? Wtf are you bitching about?
ZONEofTECH First off, the guy in the video is me. And I have a name, which is Daniel, by the way. Anyway, 8GB really IS insane for a console. Keep in mind that the current Xbox only has 512mb DDR2 ram, while the PS3 has 256mb. The difference between a game X on console and the same game on PC is almost nonexistent. Imagine how good the games will look like with a 2GB GPU, 8GB Ram and Quad Core CPU.
ZONEofTECH i5 and i7 can be quad core as well....
ZONEofTECH noob... know your facs... and also NO. NO i5  i7 they need a fucking amd processor becouse amd BLACK FUSION owns together with amdati card
ZONEofTECH standard for computer not for console which will retail price for a massive loss u tit
ZONEofTECH Actually they lose money on new consoles for the first few years. They make the money on game sales. Look it up.
ZONEofTECH My pc sucks. All that porn spyware AM I RIGHT?
ZONEofTECH Will the game graphics be better than the xbox360 please
ZONEofTECH xbox will have a bigger market share because of the fantastic opportunities and functionalities offered bt kinect which is currently unparalleled on the market.
ZONEofTECH I like both consoles, both have good exclusives, Xbox is usually better for most multiplats because those games are developed on the 360 first, then ported to PS3 without extra effort to make the most of the cell  RSX combined in PS3. IMO it balances out because the PS3 has a decent selection of its own exclusives that interest me more than 360s 1st party games, though I do love Gears, Fable, Forza, Halo. Sony has a more varied selection  wider range of 1st partyexclusive stuff.
ZONEofTECH That controller will drive me mad lol
ZONEofTECH Why Xbox 720 then and not just the new Xbox dickhead .
ZONEofTECH your a dumb ass it like 3 times better then the xbox 360 when they make it
ZONEofTECH By the way the is a Stem box it is called xi3
ZONEofTECH Ps is better overall, that kinect is the truth though. So, Xbox or ps4? How about both!
ZONEofTECH Why would it have 8gig of ram? I dont see a need as it will proberly be running a hybrid Windows 8 RT.
ZONEofTECH Niklasfrilander But you have to ask what sort of service ps3 delivered? How many time has sonys network gone down, there security got hacked and lost loads of peoples details which sony shouldnt of been holding in the 1st place. The network was very slow and laggy, plus you really shouldnt do gaming with wireless its bad on pings plus do you really want Cancer? Wireless is worster than a mobile phone...
ZONEofTECH buy it . worth the money
ZONEofTECH oh... so you cant play ranked right?..

ZONEofTECH It does work on HoTS. Ok :) The requests for that video have been INSANE :D Tomorrow (4th of July 2013!) The independence day will bring some independence to Heart of the Swarm as well (if you know what I mean)

ZONEofTECH its been almost a year since this, its probably been fixed with a patch
ZONEofTECH i already know than but now sc2 is changed to heart of the swarm vertion so it doesnt work in the new game

ZONEofTECH I really hope you get that video up soon! D:
ZONEofTECH hey man Im YloSwagTroll from starcraft 2 contact me
ZONEofTECH Glitch has been found so many times before this upload, where the hell you from??? Here in the US this has been used for while now, no need to show it off like you.
ZONEofTECH LOL MAN I FOUND THIS GLITCH ON MY OWN A WEEK AGO
ZONEofTECH friend asked me to play terranwhen i went back the glitch failed WORST MISTAKE EVER
ZONEofTECH Maybe they got rid of the glitch. Anyway, be sure to follow the instructions from the description precisely.
ZONEofTECH Didnt work. Its not fair or is it?
ZONEofTECH what did you do to make it work? cause if you follow the video it doesnt wrk!! i see random for computer but whn i play 2 games and restart the game ..it still keeps me as terran
ZONEofTECH im confused : when at 1:49 when u said select ipsw i didnt download it so it didnt work. HELP ME?
ZONEofTECH how long is the Please wait while your build is being processed exploiting with limera1n cuz its been 10 mins
ZONEofTECH The one that Im showing in the video in tethered. BUT there is a semi tethered workaround if you go to the website in the description. With semi untethered you can boot but safari,mail and messages are unusable until you connect it to a computer.
ZONEofTECH it didnt work for Iphone 4s
ZONEofTECH IPSW :)) yeah I know, the 2nd time I said it correctly :)
ZONEofTECH where is your ipsw link. you need a special one for older devices not just any 6.0 ipsw
ZONEofTECH What do u export ur movies with cause the quality is great ?
ZONEofTECH Yup, exactly. Thats what I said in the video. On Android it actually can control apps and its even faster than Siri (but the difference is not that huge in terms of speed, just a couple of seconds)
ZONEofTECH google now on ios is only for web it cant control ios related apps
ZONEofTECH Yup, I live in manchester :)
ZONEofTECH Filming with my iPad 3, editing in Final Cut Pro X, exporting in 1080 Full HD :)
ZONEofTECH wow, sorry. I just noticed this. Yeah, I know the differences between the two. GV is for android devices and it is fully integrated into the OS, like Siri is, while GVS is just an app for iOS which lets you search using your voice. The only difference between the 2 things is that one of them GV is fully integrated into the OS. My bad, I think even in the video I kept saying Google Voice instead of GVC. Changing the title right away. Thx for noticing!
ZONEofTECH You need to distinguish Google Voice from Google Voice Search. Your video is for GVS, not GV. GV is an alternate phone serviceapp and has nothing to do with this.
ZONEofTECH kinect was made by apple :l
ZONEofTECH I reboxed my Leap Motion and threw it into the pit of crap Ill never use again. It definitely has potential and seems exciting, but its a HUGE disappointment thats incredibly cumbersome rather than helpful.
ZONEofTECH I have rarely seen such a blatantly misleading title and video.
ZONEofTECH Screw this, look at LEAP MOTION, truly amazing, soz about dising u
ZONEofTECH Pretty annoying that you dont explain that Flutter uses your WEBCAM to control your mac. It has nothing to do with kincet, its just motion control of your mac with builtin webcam
ZONEofTECH Watching this on my ipad mini
ZONEofTECH I dont know :))) but yeah it is called a TV Ad :D Funny, I know
ZONEofTECH This is called TV AD? Are advertisements in US truly four minutes long?

ZONEofTECH Is it worth selling my new ipad or ipad 3 to get this??
ZONEofTECH Apple is full of shit why buy such over priced crap
ZONEofTECH Not worth it. I got first :)
ZONEofTECH I saw it on livestream
ZONEofTECH HELL NO! Its more like an over sized iPod touch 5.
ZONEofTECH sad, i just got my iMac 2 days ago :(
ZONEofTECH you should return it, you still got time
ZONEofTECH good bye 500GB, Hello 3TB!
ZONEofTECH I always wonder how those super huge graphic cards are shrunk down to fit into these imacsmac book pros.. Do they really perform the same with the full sized graphic cards? I mean, they dont have any cooling fans or what not,, I just dont see how it could work..
ZONEofTECH OfficialMrUpdate details...
ZONEofTECH Ive been waiting for this... almost buyed it the las mont. Im happy didnt do it, lol.
ZONEofTECH waited so long for this, HAPPY!
ZONEofTECH I got my first iMac a month ago, but Im not too bothered as its 100 more for each model and no optical drive
ZONEofTECH shit man i wouldnt want to be in your place
ZONEofTECH 1) Please dont support apple. Optical drive is a essential maybe 10 years after this people might not use it but people use it to play movies, games and music cds what about to reinstall Mac or install Windows on Boot camp you will have to pay 100 or so to buy a optical drive. Apple is doing that so they can make extra money by selling other things with the computer. 2) Computers can input video i have my PS3 connected to my iMac with a mini display to HDMI adapter.
ZONEofTECH 1) Optical drive is obsolete, nobody uses it anymore. (I havent used one for over a year) 2) It DOES have a Mini Display Port BUT no computer can input video, just output. So the only way to play xboxps3 is to connect them to your TVmonitor
ZONEofTECH Guys, please LIKE and SHARE this videos so more people can see it. Thank you :D
ZONEofTECH Have shared to FB,good vidThanx :)
ZONEofTECH This is still really expensive. Shipping with 128gb SSD with intel core i5. Makes no sense. Apple is just not looking of how bad the economy is.
ZONEofTECH things like this with lowering prices of such products next year are actually factors that kick start the economy back into full force

ZONEofTECH Hehe Cheers mate and congratulations :D !!!!
ZONEofTECH Do i get a free iPad Mini :)
ZONEofTECH Please help, do i still download the 32 bit version of linux when my mac is 64 bit? Thanks!
ZONEofTECH This isnt the iPhone 5.,..
ZONEofTECH No, but Siri works exactly the same on both the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 4S. No differences at all.
ZONEofTECH Okay cheers mate cuz im doing am early upgrade tomorrow and im new to the ios phones so would there be any point of upgradin to the fine or shouldni get the 4s ? Also does the 4s run on ios 7???
ZONEofTECH Niggardly thats no iPhone 5 u dumbass
ZONEofTECH The iPhone 5 is a bit bigger and faster. Other than that, everything else is the same.
ZONEofTECH Is there any diffrence between iphone 4s and the 5 as everyone says there both the same just the new iphone is a lot bigger????
ZONEofTECH yeah, but its a LOT slower.
ZONEofTECH actually, there is a difference. Siri on the iphone 5 is much faster than the 4s, and the noises siri makes is a little clearer on the 5 than the 4s.
ZONEofTECH No, but Siri works exactly the same on both the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 4S. No differences at all.
ZONEofTECH Next time ask for the standing bro, ahahahaha !
ZONEofTECH Now I get it! thanks! :D
ZONEofTECH its not that google didnt make a new app. its that apple had control over the api and didnt want google to design it. they only paid google to use their services (same goes with the youtube app... hence why the new app is completely different from the one on previous iOS) i would like to add that the google maps api by apple was actually rushed out 1 week before the iphone was released apple apologized for their new maps, so i see no logic in you defending it, if apple themselves arent.
ZONEofTECH That 3G connection was working overtime.
ZONEofTECH Wow rotating vector based maps....pssst android been had that!!!
ZONEofTECH Google map is BASED on VECTORS too..OMG do your research before making a fool out of yourself (or rather a fanboy..
ZONEofTECH Apple has improved maps, watch WWDC 2013 for proof.
ZONEofTECH Here you go you retard: appleinsider(dot)comarticles120803insideapplesnewvectorbasedmapsinios6 Thx for the thumbs down. Do a brain transplant before commenting you retarded chimp.
ZONEofTECH Yes it did. Thats why Apple built their own Maps App. Because Google didnt update the Google Maps App for iOS since its introduction in 2007.
ZONEofTECH jajajajjajajajaj que chimba esa tegnologia
ZONEofTECH you say this works on windows? how do I configure windows for this? thanx

ZONEofTECH in case i update my ipad 3 4G would the baseband be locked to carriers?
ZONEofTECH Haha thx :D I kinda need more subscribers like you. )
ZONEofTECH How do I update my Ipad 3
ZONEofTECH Ok, Im just answering this because youre a girl (probably) and your avatar is damn hot. Jailbreak  hack your iPhone so you can install custom Apps, themes basically tweek the entire operating system. And yes, you can get free app store apps. (You didnt hear this from me :D )
ZONEofTECH The best earpods ever!
ZONEofTECH you do express shipping i believe
ZONEofTECH yeah :( :,( ahh man he makes it so much better
ZONEofTECH The bad thing is they only goin to sell 32 and 64 gb
ZONEofTECH I want a 16gig so it will cost 250
ZONEofTECH it will release in oct 29 64gb cost 439
ZONEofTECH Pre ordered the 64 gb coming in 2 days!
ZONEofTECH no, the 64gb cost 399 the 32gb cost 300 :P
ZONEofTECH stick your ipod on the of a huge ass speaker, let it marinade overnight and voila! you get the idea.
ZONEofTECH Nice but doesnt have flash dont you? Explain please
ZONEofTECH WHAT YOU RECOMMEND? DO I SELL MY IPHONE 4 TO BUY THIS IPOD ?
ZONEofTECH Actually there has been. Back in the olden days when the iphone 3g was the newer model, the ipod touch 2g was released and by all accounts was technically superior. Just google ipod touch 2g vs iphone 3g or take a look at their geekbench scores.
ZONEofTECH hey nice video.. may i know if the ipod touch 5 has been released in stores?
ZONEofTECH Now I have something to countdown for
ZONEofTECH Youre basically quoting the words and explaining the pics. I could do that myself. Not very helpful
ZONEofTECH The difference between 8gb and 32gb in cost to apple is nickles and dimes. Apple doesnt price based on cost, they price based on what people will pay. They are pricing it above the iPod 4g because they want to continue selling the 4g at the same price, and they dont want to cannibalize their iPhone sales with a decent iPod touch for 200 dollars.
ZONEofTECH Which one is better as a color silver or blue
ZONEofTECH Bre i aint homo but i love yer accent its tight:)
ZONEofTECH what about teleportaion ??? ) cant wait!
ZONEofTECH fuark hahha bought my 4g few months ago im leaving my current 1 on 5.1.1 firmware and buying the new one soon
ZONEofTECH I have the third generation and drooling over this
ZONEofTECH ME TOO I CANT WAIT!!! im getting either white or blue, cant figure out which one
ZONEofTECH Sorry. The Iphone 5 has more RAM and the next generation processor thats twice as fast. The Ipod touch 5 is just a thinner iphone 4s without the phone ability and it has IOS 6.
ZONEofTECH I will wait for iPad mini. I hope it will come in many colors too
ZONEofTECH what.......the gay bar?
ZONEofTECH Im on red 5th gen :))
ZONEofTECH I have the weirdest boner right now...
ZONEofTECH does the back camera has flash?
ZONEofTECH im getting a (product) red one sometime this week
ZONEofTECH frisat?? u had no idea what u were talkin abt.. :p
ZONEofTECH Most likely getting it Wednesday :)
ZONEofTECH Yeah, most of the ipod fans want this because of siri..is a feature in the 5g
ZONEofTECH Everyone check out the galaxy player 5.0 it is the iPod killer
ZONEofTECH Black is best for ipod touch 5g and whitesilver for iphone
ZONEofTECH FK i just bought a new ipod a week ago!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH What is that thing on the back, in the upper right corner ??? Cant wait !!!
ZONEofTECH SO CORRECT!!! i preordered it on the 14 of september

ZONEofTECH for fuck sake i have to wait till the 25th of december (christmas):(:(:(:(:(:(:(
ZONEofTECH Cheers and thx for all the likes :D !
ZONEofTECH Most likely getting it Wednesday :)
ZONEofTECH why not just buy a normal camera if you want all that. it doesnt give you enough freedom to customize like android does.
ZONEofTECH Yeah, most of the ipod fans want this because of siri..is a feature in the 5g
ZONEofTECH Everyone check out the galaxy player 5.0 it is the iPod killer
ZONEofTECH Black is best for ipod touch 5g and whitesilver for iphone
ZONEofTECH FK i just bought a new ipod a week ago!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH What is that thing on the back, in the upper right corner ??? Cant wait !!!
ZONEofTECH SO CORRECT!!! i preordered it on the 14 of september
ZONEofTECH Yes, it has been released! :D
ZONEofTECH can we use navigation on this one?
ZONEofTECH you can look up apple special event 2012 ipod touch 5th generation by justinhu5 thats the closest info youll get on the 5g and no release date was provided
ZONEofTECH Coming out by christmas?
ZONEofTECH I am SOOOO gettin this, Mann I am so happy bout Siri on the iPod touch now soo excited!!!!
ZONEofTECH niot buying thuis crap
ZONEofTECH I think i broken my ipod 4 and buy this one
ZONEofTECH if youre talking about the camera flash, it does..it has an LED flash, but if youre talking about the flash plugin for browsers then No, no apple products have flash support.
ZONEofTECH Thank you. I really want this now :) you just earned apple 300 more lol
ZONEofTECH damm which colour ?? :
ZONEofTECH HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHHHAAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!! when i hear your voice i picture a fat dude with no hair and big glasses with a huge red tie and suspenders :3
ZONEofTECH The iPod Touch is the only Apple product I would own. My first was the 2g, then the 3g and 4g. Ill get the 64gb in Silver as a MP3 player for my new 2012 Infiniti M56s, that way theyll match. I got over 3000 songs, over 1500 pictures, and over 2000 videos saved in iTunes and in my current Touch 4s. The 5s will be syncing for a long time... Im giving away my 4s everything will be deleted.
ZONEofTECH shitttttt i have bought an ipod touch 4g on 1st sep 2012 ahhhhhhhhhh!
ZONEofTECH You can get a ps vita for that price and still have money left over...

ZONEofTECH pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaase tell me how your getting it in two days i cant get mine until october pleasseee help
ZONEofTECH REALLY:0 I am shitting my pantss already.
ZONEofTECH How much will it cost? Please reply
ZONEofTECH Shut. Your black mouth blade
ZONEofTECH He could always come back and say the ipod is thinner and lighter, or that it has the loop, or it comes in colours, etc........ While I agree with you that the iphone is superior for those two reasons, others may have different priorities and therefore disagree.
ZONEofTECH how... Ahem iphone is fatser in prossecor and connectivity. And it has a better camera. better graphics.
ZONEofTECH when i looked on their site I only found 32 costs 299 and the 64 costs 399
ZONEofTECH Nope, u still will get the same ipod (iPod Touch 4G)... lol why would u break it? just sell it then buy ipod 5g using that money. :)
ZONEofTECH i still love my5 gen ipod nano .
ZONEofTECH can you listen to music without earbuds?

ZONEofTECH Apple is going to be sued haha
ZONEofTECH It really is a video. Kenburns effect for the pictures with the trailer turns it into an EPIC blockbuster movie.
ZONEofTECH This video is not true, before the iPhone exist other smarthphones had the same style, so please tell me another design for touch smartphones? An triangular smartphone, or circular smartphone, this video has no sense, remember the palms we can say that the iPhone is a totally copy of a palm, and the same samsung conector its similar to the apples conector is because samsung has worked with apple in the past years. The nexus S is not a Samsung phone, dont be a fucking apple fanboy.
ZONEofTECH Who the fuck are you? You said everyone copy Apple, fuck no!!You better watch this video (Has Apple Really Ever Invented Anything?)
ZONEofTECH P.S the first Samsung phones may be horrible but the Samsung galaxy s4 has absolutely nothing related to apples iphones.
ZONEofTECH Samsung is obviously superior. Samsung has its own unique style. Apple needs to stop accusing phones that are better than theirs that they copy the iPhone. Seriously. Apple sucks, its copying Samsung smart gesture and adding it to the next iphone.
ZONEofTECH By the way, please SUBSCRIBE to my channel for more upcoming videos. I put a lot of effort in making the so a subscription would be greatly appreciated! Thx :D
ZONEofTECH I guess you dont like that Samsung used Lebron to advertise the Samsung note 2.
ZONEofTECH he makes me cry wen he talks :(
ZONEofTECH Yup, its true. At first Apple copied the UI from Xerox and made it a lot better. One of their biggest inventions was the capacitive multitouch screen, together with the amazing design of their products.
ZONEofTECH shut the fuck up asshole apple copied nobody
ZONEofTECH you cant invent the wheel twice
ZONEofTECH 1 apple copied alot from samsung and other androidwathever devices
ZONEofTECH Apple didnt invent everything, some of their stuff is from ideas they got from other products. The thing about apple is that they dont make crap products. They see touch screen phones, and slim computers, and think, hmm thats a good idea, they would have made more money on that idea if the product werent total crap. so then apple decides that the world would be better off if they used their expertise to make a decent product.
ZONEofTECH SAMSUNG THATS WHY THEY CHANGED TO LIGHTNING PORT FUCKK SAMSUNG
ZONEofTECH Did others then look at those succeses and copied the ? Of course, just liks LG and apple copied from those before them . Now people whining everybody copied from apple just showed they dont know anything about the history they are talking about.
ZONEofTECH Samsung is better than apple
ZONEofTECH Apple started working on the iPad years before they made the iPhone so shut up about that dum windows tablet cus apple all ready had made a tablet
ZONEofTECH Why doesn anyone bother making dribble like this? Rehash the same nonsense arguments? If you like iphone buy iphone if you like samsung buy samsung this nonsense only increases the pay checks of lawyers. Apple is JUST a brand looking for profit get over it . PS : to show you why this is dribble just look up th lg prada or any of the other smartphones designed during that period, seem familiar?
ZONEofTECH Nope, before the iPhone 99 of the phones werent tochscreens, the only famous touch screen phone before the iPhone was the LG Prada, which DIDNT have a green phone icon. Anyway, they even positioned the phone icon INSIDE the green app, the same way they did on the iPhone. At least they couldve changed it somehow. 2nd. The iPhone design dates from 2004, while the iPhone 4 design dates from 2008, so back in 2007 they didnt have the iPhone 4 design.
ZONEofTECH You seem uneducated. Are you?
ZONEofTECH You just underminded your whole argument IF prada was designing a phone simular to the iphone WITHOUT knowing anything about it (as it was only revealed months before its release and LG was already long done with its design of its smartphone) then they didnt copy. And thats the reality the market was already long moving in that direction. LG Apple and a couple others were the first to take advantage of it.
ZONEofTECH I do not get any money for my videos. At least not yet.
ZONEofTECH You are not ok are you. First of all, those icons like the phone have been green for years on other phones. The settings, microphone, notes, contacts have been around for ages used by others other than apple. Second, if the iphone has the same exact design as the iphone 4s then why didnt release that design? The iphone doesnt even look like the 4s. Apple is trying to ban the Galaxy S3 cause it looks like the iphone? Get real. By the way, Apple stole all their designs from Braun and Sony.
ZONEofTECH so apple still the best
ZONEofTECH How much did apple pay you?
ZONEofTECH The LG Prada was released in December 2006. I know what youre talking about. Apple posted an iPhone prototype from 2004 which had almost the exact same design like the current iPhone 4S. The LG Prada Prototype dates back from June 2005, so the iPhone was designed way before LG started designing the Prada. And no, this is not dribble, this is what people like you refuse to believe, that a company shamelessly copied Apple and refuses to admit it.
ZONEofTECH Samsung is piece of shit, its all apples ideas. Those lazy ass workers just stoled it. Its like apple are competiting with another apple.
ZONEofTECH Look at the pictures of Samsung products after the iPhone was announced and after then come back with a good argument
ZONEofTECH Finally someone with a solid argument and well put together video. There is NO doubt that Samsung and others completely ripped Apple off for nothing more than financial gain. What happened to innovation? Microsoft is even innovating now. Good for them. No one wants to see a company have a monopoly on tech but if you just steal other ideas instead of doing your own Research and Development... sure youll save money... but then again... you might get embarrassed in court.
ZONEofTECH No, youre a moron. I did a lot of research unlike you. APPLE didnt invent the tablet, Microsoft had the PC tablet way before Apple introduced the iPad (although they had an iPad prototype back in the 80). You really are a complete idiot, SONY didnt EVEN have ultrabooks before the MacBook Air, and Apple introduced the chiclet keyboard if you have any idea what that is. Now, every single laptop has one. Get real.
ZONEofTECH Is samsung is better than apple why did they have to copy and steal all of apples designs, ideas, and innovations? Obviously apple is superior, or else everyone wouldnt be coming out with their own versions of apples products.
ZONEofTECH Glad to see someone appreciates my video! Thanks a lot Jay! Yeah, youre right, Microsoft started innovating, with the Xbox, the Surface (not only the 1st gen but also the 2nd gen Tablet). But for some unknown reason...most of the major companies in the world still copy Apple. Guess their Design and Functionality is something that everyone wants to achieve for themselves...
ZONEofTECH u should make a video on how the ios7 looks like android.
ZONEofTECH Dude u make cry u make me question myself why!? Why!?
ZONEofTECH The best is Apple invented the tablet. You really are a moron. Check out Knight Ridder. Do some research before you post this nonsense. Apple Moron
ZONEofTECH Sony didnt have ultrabooks before the air...take a look moron sony x505 dated 2004. Apple copied that idiot.
ZONEofTECH this phone is so shit

ZONEofTECH Hey ZONEofTECH! Do you still use your iPhone 3G?

ZONEofTECH I will, Im glad you requested this.
ZONEofTECH Man I remember seeing this when it came out back then. I had a motorolla razor phone and really wanted this one but was stuck until I was due for an upgrade and I have the iphone 4 32gb now. I was so jealous that everyone had an iphone but me. But I am so happy I finally have one :)
ZONEofTECH Yes, I do :D Oh yeah....oh yeah..baby....your corners are soooooo sexxxxxxxxxyyyyy
ZONEofTECH lame we want some exitement
ZONEofTECH :D I know the feeling thrust me. I used to watch dozens of unboxing videos before getting the product I was watching. :D And I still watch a lot of unboxing videos even though I dont own the product :) SUBSCRIBE if you enjoyed my content. I will be posting more unboxing videos in the near future. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH Just bought this a few weeks ago from Gamestop really cheap. Dont give a fuck what snobbish assholes wanna say about it. I didnt even have a smartphone before, so it was an upgrade for me. Sure, it sucks compared to newer phones, but my quality of life is not diminished by having an older phone.
ZONEofTECH deci esti roman.......atunci dc nu vorbesti romana?
ZONEofTECH I am going to get the 3GS from gamestop, 8gigabyte for 135, how is the phone? I have an Android now and was wondering if it would be wise to switch.. Ive always wanted one, I can always switch back if I get tired of it, but I dont think I will.. When ever I get addicted to unboxing videos I usually get it
ZONEofTECH Mate u just dont no anything
ZONEofTECH While im waiting for my iPhone to ship,im getting addicted to these unboxing videos
ZONEofTECH He really loves the box so much :)
ZONEofTECH Looks like the iPhone 5S box
ZONEofTECH Say iPhone 5 5 times then post this on two other viedos

ZONEofTECH what a waste of bandwidth
ZONEofTECH Youre welcome. Be sure to SUBSCRIBE if you enjoyed my video, because Ill be posting more AWSOME tutorials, unboxings,reviews in the upcoming days. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH Hmm...its working for me, on 10.8.2. Just reboot after enabling it and you should be OK.
ZONEofTECH yeah!!!! just resolved it. it was just a matter of authentication from apple inc ... when i double left click on its icon a window had appeared. it said the app you are using has no authentication certificate... and i thought that it was a kind of incompatibility.but is ok... just ignore this window and i followed what you have showed up here.is so cooooool as cartman from sp could say!:)
ZONEofTECH Thanks for the video. Liked the video already :D. This was really helpful! You should do another video on what TRIM is...Upon looking at the wikipedia page, I dont think I get how it works still.
ZONEofTECH thank you so muccch!!!!
ZONEofTECH Cool :D Be sure to SUBSCRIBE if you found this video useful. Thanks drpay :)
ZONEofTECH Thank you as well :D Be sure to SUBSCRIBE if you enjoyed my content :) Cheers a104036 :)
ZONEofTECH by the way i noticed some problems regarding the latest updateof macosx. i have the 10. 8 .2 mountain lion and it doesnt work at all the trimer app.. what i should do ?
ZONEofTECH Try doing this and restarting your computer multiple times rather than just once. I havenr tried it on the 840 series but it might not work since the Trim Enabler software needs to be updated for the new SSD and Im not sure it has been updated.
ZONEofTECH I just tried your link and it wont work? Page is down?
ZONEofTECH I thought that SSDs that have a SandForce controller dont need TRIM enabled on OS X, and that even it is a bad idea to enable it, is this wrong and why?
ZONEofTECH Running latest version of OSX and Samsung 840 250gb and this worked as described :)
ZONEofTECH great, simple, helpful video. Thanks!
ZONEofTECH Hey good video... but it dose not work on my macbook pro with os 10.8.2 i have a samsung 840 series with 500 GB Thanks for help..!
ZONEofTECH Thx Sbastien! Im glad you enjoyed my video. Be sure to LIKE it and SUBSCRIBE to my channel for more such videos :) Also, Id highly appreciate it if you shared it with all of your friends on FaceBook and Twitter :) Cheers again Sbastien! Dan ZONEofTECH
ZONEofTECH great video, easy to understand! Thx )
ZONEofTECH awesome video :D I have a mac mini and when I get an SSD for it I will follow your guide in this video to enable trim support :D
ZONEofTECH Ok, thanks for the advice, I probably will. Anyway, please SUBSCRIBE to my channel if you enjoyed me content :D and also sharing this video will be great so more people can see it. Thanks a lot Clark!
ZONEofTECH Hehe :D thx a lot mate. Be sure to subscribe and like the video if you enjoyed it :) Im really glad when people appreciate my content! Cheers!
ZONEofTECH 1) move trim enabler to your desktop 2) open terminal and write the following: chmod x Trim Enabler 3)try it now, if it doesnt work contact me again if it does please SUBSCRIBE :)
ZONEofTECH Can I use ONYX and Ccleaner with SSD disk?
ZONEofTECH Tnx for the vid...but it didnt work for me...still after a couple reboots it says that the patch is active but trim wont work...im on osx 10.8.3 with Apple SSD SM128
ZONEofTECH Because of your video and included link to Trim Enabler, I could enable TRIM support for my AData 512GB SSD. Thanks for this informative video I have subscribed.
ZONEofTECH OMG HOW YOU REBOOT IT GOD I NOOB HOW TO GET STARTED!!!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH Thx youuu :D Be sure to SUBSCRIBE, Like and Share this video if you found it useful. Thanks again :) Cheers!
ZONEofTECH This works on my late 2011 Macbook Pro. I just upgraded my 7200 RPM HDD to a Samsung 840 500GB SSD with the latest Mountain Lion OSX 10.8.3! It does require a restart after the initial launch and patch to work. You sir, have earned my like  subscription.
ZONEofTECH under about this mac and system report i dont have anything that says trim support. Why is that?
ZONEofTECH between the app trimer enabler and macosx of 10.8 and up
ZONEofTECH hey guys this didnt work on a 21.5 mid 2010 iMac with Mountain Lion with an Intel 520 Series 240 gb SSD i dont know what to do, can you help me?

ZONEofTECH yes, you can. I dont know about ONYX but CCleaner works fine.
ZONEofTECH the trimer enabler.sorry for the type error. if you check the comments on the site provided from you as well as from other ones that i googled it seems that theres been some kind of incompatibility issue
ZONEofTECH Hi, Im from Switerland and I have a Macbook Pro 13, mi2010, with MAC OS X 10.8.4, a Kingston 120GB SSD and it works fine !! Thanks a lot for your video, its very nice job and so easy to understand :) (sorry for my english )

ZONEofTECH u should give it to me please
ZONEofTECH the cloud is moving so fast!
ZONEofTECH I wish I could get an ipad. But nice video :)
ZONEofTECH Thx Lisa, Im glad you liked it. Please subscribe if you want to see more of my videos, Im posting about 12 videos per day, Thanks!
ZONEofTECH Its amazing 810. (8 and not 10 because of the screen. The iPad 3 or 4 is much better due to the retina display so try and get that one) iTunes DOES NOT cause any viruses.... (parents :D ). iTunes is just for syncing your iPad to you computer (transferring music, videos apps and so on). But you dont have to use it if you dont want to. iCloud is just for mail,contacts,notes,apps and photos, not music or videos. I hope that I was clear enough. Cheers :D and please SUBSCRIBE if you enjoyed!
ZONEofTECH How do you like your ipad? My parents do not want me to download itunes because it can cause viruses, but is it necessary to have it if you have icloud?
ZONEofTECH Great video! Upgrading to an SSD was the best move I ever madeespecially because I dual boot.One strange thing: I back up to a 5400 RPM 1TB SeaGate GoFlex HDD over 2x faster than your internal hard drive, and thats via Firewire 800. It doesnt make sense.
ZONEofTECH I got Samsung Evo 840 SSD and they are incredible fast than HDD. Good thing I got mine on Amazon and they are on sale for SSD  amzn.o1aUNmtO
ZONEofTECH Excellent video. I have a 5400 in my Alienware right now and am sure it is bottlenecking my machine. This video has convinced me to just order a Samsung 840 EVO 250GB. Cant wait to see the performance results. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH Hello, Do you use SATA 3 for the ssd?
ZONEofTECH This is soooooo old lol
ZONEofTECH hehe awsome :D I made a video on how to enable trim. Check it out :) Please SHARE my videos so more people can see them cause at the moment I dont have that many views :(
ZONEofTECH Sorry for the long 18min video but I just wanted to cover everything I could possible imagine. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH Thx :D Please be sure to SHARE this video on FaceBook and Twitter, because I have put a lot of effort in making this video and unfortunatelly it doesnt have as many views as it deserves. Thank you! :D Also please SUBSCRIBE to my channel if you enjoyed my content Cheers and thank you for your support :D !
ZONEofTECH I think it is not a fair vs, as there are better HDD with 7200. I suggest a SSD with Black WD at 7200rpm.
ZONEofTECH This is soooooo old lol
ZONEofTECH I know this is on a mac but would you get the same results using windows 8 with same specs
ZONEofTECH and the shut down time is only handy when your girlfriend walks in when you where watching porn if she minds)
ZONEofTECH Also, about the movement test, it doesnt really matter for HDDs anymore. Theyve become extremely efficient and accurate and wont fail if you move them unless you throw your laptop out of a window, but the point is SSDs last longer cuz they cant wear down mechanicallyPhysically.
ZONEofTECH I have a 1 TB hdd at 5400rpm and im looking into upgrading to ssd, this vid is exactly what i was looking for lol.
ZONEofTECH Thank you for your support. Please Subscribe for more videos, Ill be posting about a video per day and subscribing to my channel not only will give you access to all of my newest videos but will also determine me to make even more videos with even more professionalism . Thank you.
ZONEofTECH something like lagging! i said that because at my deskot i havent problems with that game (resident evil raccon city) also desktop its quite old! intel pentium dual core  2.6 4 gbramm kingstom hypper x nvidia geforce 9800gt hdd: wd caviar black 10.000 rpm! thanks anyway!
ZONEofTECH Yes, it will make it faster, but you MacBook only has SATA 1 which means that the max speed will be about 100mbs read, instead of 500 which I am getting now. So no, the difference will not be huge. Also, TRIM is worth enabling. Check out my TRIM enable video. Also please SUBSCRIBE to support me :) Thx:D
ZONEofTECH great indepth video!! thank you...im buying the SSD!
ZONEofTECH what kind of problems do you have?
ZONEofTECH I have a 5400RPM HDD, and I cant hear anything unless I literally put my ear on the macbook. I think its just the sound of the fan that Im hearing as well, and not the HDD.
ZONEofTECH yeah nice comparing ssd with a 5400 rpm hdd thats not even fair for hdd
ZONEofTECH Thanks for the video, it was very extensive in details and benchmarks! One note only is that 64 GB of free space may seem inadequate for multimedia usage. For Office usage are ok. I am waiting for the price drop of 840 series 500GB. They are 342 euros now. When they reach 200 euro mark i will take it.
ZONEofTECH Valuable material. Thank you.
ZONEofTECH im getting a 1tb hhd 5400rpm and 8gb ssd hybrid..is that badd
ZONEofTECH i realllllllllly need a SSD
ZONEofTECH Do SSDs have a lifespan? I vaguely remember hearing they are good for 5 years. We have to replace them every 5 years or so.
ZONEofTECH no one was talking to you bitch
ZONEofTECH idk if you know but mcbooks are too weak to get the full power of the ssd haha bottleneck
ZONEofTECH Whats the point in my HP Windows 8.1 Laptop I got SSD and HDD at the same time :P
ZONEofTECH Mother fuck samsung ssds because their so slow I bought one for 350 and it was so slow the hdd is faster than the ssd in a 1000000764589643221578900086421135789087532211278 times slower. I HATE SAMSUNG the apple ssd is faster than the samsung one in 157863323789009753224567532116789963214579952224567742211345780086321456974325688942135890754212357795436909542. TIMES
ZONEofTECH nice job! i need your opinion! i bought a laptop  toshiba satellite i5 2.5gh 4gb ram 750hdd 5400 rpm amd 7670 1gb in some games i have litle problems ! if i replace hbb with a ssd ! these problems would be fixed? (sorry for my english)!
ZONEofTECH is there a possibility to have both the ssd and the hdd harddrive ?
ZONEofTECH does it work on macbook unibody 5.1 ?
ZONEofTECH If you already have OS X Mountain Lion installed on your HDD just follow Method A found in the Description box. Could you please give me some more details like if you have an external HDD, how new is your MBP, whats your configuration? I would really like to help you but again, I need some more details. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH WTF, I thought he meant the fruit...grape. Sick people...sick people everywhere...
ZONEofTECH Grape is slang for gang rape. Please dont post any videos :P
ZONEofTECH Yes, definitely. Ditch that shit. The 2013 MacBook air is waaaaay more powerful than the 2011 Pro. Both in CPU and Graphics performance. Not to mention the thinner design and 18h battery.
ZONEofTECH Yes, I do like grapes :D SUBSCRIBE to my channel, I might post some grape videos pretty soon :)
ZONEofTECH What if I want my OS (mountain lion) to be on the SSD?? BTW I have the same SSD
ZONEofTECH Whats the name of that song or beat in the background ?
ZONEofTECH This was very helpful. Thank you.
ZONEofTECH Hehe thx:D Im glad when someone appreciates my work. Be sure to subscribe to my channel, that keeps me motivated :)
ZONEofTECH Why do Germans get the best music?
ZONEofTECH Hello Zoneoftech should i ditch my Macbook pro 13 2011 stock for an Macbook air 13 haswell?
ZONEofTECH Well, Internet Recovery ONLY reinstalls your OS (LionMountain Lion) and only works on 2011 or newer MBPs. After you got your OS onto your new SSD, you have to restore your data from a Time Machine Backup.
ZONEofTECH The video really helped a lot. I installed new RAM and an SSD onto my MacbookPro 2011. I especially liked how you showed us how to update via wifi. Thanks
ZONEofTECH does it make any sense which RAM I buy? Do I need a special RAM card?
ZONEofTECH The links are now active. I was asleep so thats why I didnt put them up. The SSD vs HDD link doesnt exist since the video is not up yet.
ZONEofTECH WTF, I thought he meant the fruit...grape. Sick people...sick people everywhere...
ZONEofTECH Thanks and keep the great work!
ZONEofTECH I like grapes. Do you like grapes? We should be grape friends
ZONEofTECH what background noise?
ZONEofTECH Sure and thanks for the rapid response. I just bought a brand new 2012 15 MBP 2.3GHz 500 GB Apple HDD last week. I have absolutely nothing on it in terms of dataor anything. I have been purposely waiting unitl I can put the SSD in to put any softwaredataetc. on it. I also have an 128GB Samsung 830 SSD. I am going to put he SSD in the HDD place and the HDD in the opti bay. So, what I want to do is have my OS on and boot from the SSD.
ZONEofTECH Nah, I just think that everything they manage to pull off in terms of their bullshit hardashell to customise and maintain is nuts, and the prices they change is beyond belief.
ZONEofTECH Thx :D Worked really hard on making his come true. !Just for you guys to know, this is actually my 2nd upgrade video. The 1st one was done without a tripod, had almost no lighting at all and was unprofessional. So yeah, I reinstalled my old HDD and RAM just to make this video. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH Will this work on the current mac book pro 15 inch? (As of June 25, 2013)
ZONEofTECH Thx :D Im really glad I was able to help you. Please SUBSCRIBE to my channel if you havent already done so. By doing this you motivate and support me. Thx alot redd3 :)
ZONEofTECH This was awesome. Thanks man. Ive just installed my new ram and ssd following this. I had a bootable usb ready. But the wifi install was so much easier. Awesome..
ZONEofTECH How can i get Mac OS on a new ssd? MacBook Pro 2009? Just insert the disk? And how to start the disk installation ?
ZONEofTECH also is it better to recover from a bootable drive or by internet recovery?
ZONEofTECH What is the thickness of an SSD for an early 2011 Macbook Pro 17 inch?
ZONEofTECH This seriously made a HUGE improvement on my macbook pro. Is completely as good as advertised and this video made it all too easy for a rookie to do!!
ZONEofTECH There is a way to edit the image so it will fit on a standard DVD, but I cant remember how. :(
ZONEofTECH If I put this os on a computer that I sell that I use a pre purchased code, that I use on my computer, is their a way for them to hack into my computer? Thanks
ZONEofTECH is this for free or what
ZONEofTECH I love the Darth Vader breathing at the end.
ZONEofTECH You need a dual layer DVD to burn because I tried a single layer and it says not enough space to burn. I inserted a dual layer 8.5 GB DVD and it burned thanx a lot for the help I thumbed up your video too.
ZONEofTECH You say click restore as the last step but it wont let me. Ugh.
ZONEofTECH I have this one buy in green I got it on EBay. 8 GB.I got one Brand new for X mass in 2007the Red one but i brooke it trying to take the back cover off.
ZONEofTECH Had one till my cousin chucked it in a corn field
ZONEofTECH I just brought a use one this style ipod didnt know it was this old I guess should did research I pay way to much for it...
ZONEofTECH haha stick in there thats what she said
ZONEofTECH The aaaa... SAME GOES FOR THE TOP!!!
ZONEofTECH Its a video of course hes supposed to talk would you rather have him stay quiet?! i prefer more talking because it means more information
ZONEofTECH walmart if there in stock
ZONEofTECH are there difference with the scroll wheel with ipod classic?
ZONEofTECH Just press any button :) It will turn on in less than a second :D
ZONEofTECH Thanks a lot :D Q: Do you think I should keep the spinning ZONEofTECH logo in the bottom right corner that used to be in my previews videos?
ZONEofTECH I care about music, i just dont have billions of songs. You would get this one BECAUSE its smaller, thinner, lighter. Sure, Its not a big difference, but the price is VERY different.
ZONEofTECH this was also my first ever apple product, I got it when it was first released when I was 9 :L i still have it, its the 8gb blue version. I have since gotten the apple iPad 2 (white, 32gb , wifi model) , the 5th gen iPod nano (blue, 8gb ) and I recently just got the 5th gen iPod touch (silver Nd white 64gb version.) Im soon hoping to add a iPhone 5 or maybe even the 4s to my apple collection :D
ZONEofTECH Thx :D be sure to SUBSCRIBE to my channel if you enjoyed my content Cheers :D !
ZONEofTECH Where can I get one brand new ?
ZONEofTECH Better than the iPod Shuffle.
ZONEofTECH hahaha i have the same ipod nano and it too was my first venture into buying an apple product, it was the first ipod that i actually liked and still like to this day, i just went to game stop and bought a used but well taken care of black 8 gig ipod nano 3rd gen and i plan to keep using then till they stop working.
ZONEofTECH i still use mine up to today 2013
ZONEofTECH I dont have anything against apple, its just not me. This little gadget however has me wanting to buy one lol. In my own opinion this is the best design for the ipod nano ever made.
ZONEofTECH why get this when you can get an ipod classic, its exactly the same just that it is a bit thicker and bigger, also its mainly know for its storage space and it has 160gb version, and if you dont care about storage space you clearly dont care about music.
ZONEofTECH Hold the play button.
ZONEofTECH Yeah, good old times. Be sure to subscribe if you liked this video, like it, even favorite it if you want. Ill be posting over 30 videos in the upcoming days, all of them filmed in 1080p. It would help me a lot, since at the moment I do not have so many subscribers, nor views. Thank you
ZONEofTECH SOLVED: It seems that one of my RAM is loose. Thats what the 3 beeps meant.
ZONEofTECH I had this last year. It lasted 9 months, first the light went out, then the fan stopped working. But all in all it worked very well, plus I got it off eBay for 67 with bucks (Free shipping).
ZONEofTECH Or just make one, cheaper, and more efficient.
ZONEofTECH Nah, I usually talk like that when presenting the product. Its quite difficult for me to make these videos in English, since its not my first language. Anyway, thx you again for watching and also for subbing :) Oh, and thx for the extra views, its really appreciated.
ZONEofTECH Thx, what do you mean by a normal voice?
ZONEofTECH I cant believe someone actually gave me this for christmas  Overclocking right now
ZONEofTECH was this the X2 , X3 or just nothing?
ZONEofTECH where did you buy this?
ZONEofTECH Does this support 17.3 inch laptops?
ZONEofTECH So had it broke by now?
ZONEofTECH how loud is the noise in dB (decibel)?
ZONEofTECH i have one its works good and its cheap but i have switch the fan from here to pull out the air i thinghs works better and dont take all the dust in my laptop
ZONEofTECH I own this ..Its weak. dont buy

This is just a one off live show they did down in London at the weekend. I took a bit of a holiday and traveled down to see them and visit some friends. Was a good laugh :)

screenjunkies Where are the vampires? I call bogus.
screenjunkies Omg I love bill and Ted
screenjunkies major spoiler to Lincoln in this trailer!
screenjunkies That film is retarded . Now Im going to be flamed but oh well.
screenjunkies Your telling the truth bro, I feel the same way
screenjunkies While I love your other stuff  its the Honest trailers that Im here for.
screenjunkies Ted we gotta go back and stop Lincoln from getting shot, WYLD STALLIONS!
screenjunkies Insert best joke award here
screenjunkies Now that would make a Stellar part 3, dude!!
screenjunkies i have to disagree with your score. id probably go with a 7 for originality. an 8 is pushing it.
screenjunkies Hey dumbass, you dont pay shit for the videos they produce. Quit complaining and skip things you dont want. If they saturate the channel with only Honest Trailers, they could get boring. Let them do what they want. Do you call TV channels and complain when they show things other than your favorite show? Then shut the fuck up.
screenjunkies I dont know anybody that talks like Bill  Ted, then again this aint the early ninetys....or
screenjunkies I 4 you screen junkies
screenjunkies How was it boring? And yes, it wasnt entirely about slavery. But it did play a huge part in it.

screenjunkies Please say: Martin Freeman is made out of jam, kittens and rage.
screenjunkies Thanks for reminding us how dull and boring Lincoln was.
screenjunkies Why do people like this movie?
screenjunkies Why cant he complain? He supports screenjunkies by watching their clips, and when they put out shit like this, people complain.
screenjunkies I would SO watch this!!!!
screenjunkies The only reason this is entertaining to me is because they are currently working on a Bill  Ted 3 script and such right now... I just... Its just... I kinda cant wait to see what its going to look like haha
screenjunkies employee of the month (2004) with matt dillon NOT THE ON WITH JESSICA SIMPSON! this is such a great film with a great twist ending but noone has ever heard of it and i can never find it.. everyone always seems to think im talking about the one with jessica simpson.. and i hated that film!
screenjunkies My weed most be wicked because for a minute there I thought this was legit
screenjunkies I got halfway through this before realising this wasnt the real trailer headdesk
screenjunkies Um considering the reason the civil war was started was because the south wanted to keep slavery and the north didnt Im PRETTY SURE it was about slavery...
screenjunkies To bad they didnt show Mary Todd Lincoln, I heard shes one bodacious babe.
screenjunkies Bill and Ted was on yesterday, most excellent of movies
screenjunkies people have probably already asked you this but, please tell me what he said :)
screenjunkies yeah, what a shocker...

screenjunkies I will now go and see this movie eighty times in 3d and not pirate it ever. Piracy its bad and you get splinters which wont come out with wet hand, plus there is seawater which can sting the holes. The puncture holes.
screenjunkies Phr33Pur3 neither do I, but hipsters used to be a smaller part of trendsetters, allways stating that they started wearing this and listening to that BEFORE it was popular. remember? hipsters used to not go with social trends, at least thats what they thought.

screenjunkies Where do you buy your hoodies?
screenjunkies Usually when the interviewer tries to get more attention than the stars, they fail and its really painful to watch. This time it was glorious.
screenjunkies This is the most awesome thing Ive seen in maybe 70 hours!
screenjunkies This didnt show up in my sub box!!! I stumbled across it! not cool youtube! Amazing Flula, so funny!
screenjunkies this makes me fucking JACKED
screenjunkies that tshirt should be a crime to wear in public
screenjunkies Actors trying so hard not to be assholes  We see right through you  haha
screenjunkies A buddy komedy flick with Flula and Jason Segel would KILL.
screenjunkies He looks like Chris Burke the baseball player
screenjunkies Dear Flula: Im so in love with you right now. But not in a creepsy way. Sincerely, Me.
screenjunkies Where do I get the Tshirt with the laser beam eye cat? Can I get the Amazing Flula to sign it?

screenjunkies omfg youre good videos always blocked in germany
screenjunkies Boom! He show up, like on da cousches! :) HeehhehehelarryUs! :)

GameSack 1,000 SUBSCRIBER!!!!!!!
GameSack Love your reviews Tim, keep them up!
retrogametech Wait? Did I see it right, no Donkey Kong Country 1 or 2, but Donkey Konga is?
retrogametech Resident Evil 4 foreva! :O hahahah Im actually curious... haha Is Loco Roco in there?!?!?!
retrogametech Bought this today from Glasgow Oxfam for 3.99 Yippee
retrogametech 20robo09 its the best in the series thats for sure
retrogametech Nice book, I might pick one up.
retrogametech HA call of duty is in this book
retrogametech 4:00 MYST! OMG! One of the best PC games ever! If not, the best.
retrogametech Play MYST now! And Riven after! It was an innovative Adventure and still a nice one today. You really have first no clue, what to do and have to figure it out by yourself. Like beeing stranded after a friggin InterdimensionalTime Travel  Fail. I started with Riven by the way, never thought i had to learn a written language that exist in a game, but it was really interessting.
retrogametech cynicshminic I absolutely agree. That always happens with the videogame world. I guess that they make so because, once again in a good idea in videogames, they focus on teenagers. I thought about buying it but your words are so true...
retrogametech i love space invaders
retrogametech He obviously is not Silent Bob this we can know for sure but, are you Silent Bob?
retrogametech HPZeta Haha, I always played on consoles growing up so never really played any point and click games. But, thats the cool thing about this book. No I know :P Yeah I was surprised it was so cheap. 10 is very good value. Id have paid more.
retrogametech Good review! ps. You never heard of Myst?! Damn I must be getting old.
retrogametech shadowtsunami haha, I already have! Just didnt make a vid of it :)
retrogametech Wtf is that Xbox controller? It looks awesome!
retrogametech ArcadeMameMachine Yeah, if someone bought it me as a present Id love it.
retrogametech Wow you never heard of myst,I spent a good couple of months of my childhood life trying to solve its puzzles, it wasis probably the best puzzle point and click adventure of all time, well worth a play :) PS Also bought the boo after seeing it on another youtubers video , but here it cost R380 or 33 British pounds
retrogametech seriosly you havent heard of myst? its the second most sold pc game ever, its really amazing but you have to have paitence : great vids btw!
retrogametech Peterdorr did a review on this same book. )
retrogametech 6:10 Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom Epic game.
retrogametech Its a Dreamcast Controller. Thats a console from late 90s early 2000s.
retrogametech I just ordered after this rewiev.this is the book I was looking for.thanks for the rewiev.
retrogametech ARMY OF TWO?!?! that sucks
retrogametech 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die  Book Review  Retro And Modern Gaming The new FPS with stunning graphics
retrogametech ryanc519 Why not? Its probably one of the best games Ive played on the PS3. Top quality game.
retrogametech I have this book.I got it for 10.00  with a different cover.
retrogametech siebe1998 Yeap its there. Almost all breakthrough,innovative games are in there from every genre. All 90s RPGs from black Isle, all the first FPS are there, as well as strategy, action and adventure games. Team Fortress 1 is even praised in this book.
retrogametech YLJesus Lol, thanks dude! Glad you like the vids :)
retrogametech never heard of myst? what kinda player are ye?
retrogametech Have you ever played Manhunt 1 or 2?
retrogametech I might get that book
retrogametech You dont know us gamers.
retrogametech RetroGameTech haha nice you should like make a video of all your hamma bead collections
retrogametech Damn fucking right Gears of War is in that book.
retrogametech I have heard a lot about this book i should pick it up sometime.
retrogametech 20robo09 Its not a listchart of the best selling or popular games. Its just a collection of 1001 uniqueweirdgroundbreakingawesome etc games you should try.
retrogametech heavenly sword surely isnt included in the list
retrogametech ryanc519 did you even watch the entire video? he showed heavenly sword inside the book.
retrogametech Myst was the worst 20 Ive ever spent. Should have got StarCraft.
retrogametech Retrogamer71 Same here
retrogametech Story book time with your host RetroGameTech
retrogametech WhatAreYouBuyen Youll be pleased to know that almost every RE game is in here, hahaha. And LocoRoco 2 is listed but not the original.
retrogametech I got this book for christmas, it makes me so happy!
retrogametech RetroGameTech What about Conkers bad fur day (n64) ???
retrogametech Call of Duty: Modern Warefare (COD4) Has to be at number 1.
retrogametech You will actually die because of stress if you really want to play all of these games.
retrogametech you should do that space invaders logo on the front of the book with hamma beads :D
retrogametech Can someone tell me what Wii games are there in the book? I took a quick look at it the only time I found it in stores and saw there was quite a bit but I dont know them all, and since I have a Wii I may try some of them.
retrogametech Resident Evil 4 foreva! :O hahahah Im actually curious... haha Is Loco Roco in there?!
retrogametech awesome i think I might just pick that up
retrogametech This guy is awsome he reveiws realy intresting Things I Love Him (NO HOMO) :)
retrogametech My Dreamcast ended up with a hole drilled in it when I tried to get the screws out to press in the contacts at the front (a common problem) and used a removable screw head (it got stuck), had to get it drilled out. It worked fine after though. Tried it recently and it carried on a bit and the ground became see through in Crazy Taxi.
retrogametech RetroGameTech same thing has happened to mine.I have opened the console but cannot see anything burned.how can I find out whether its the cap or the whole psu? did yours had a noticable sign of damage on the cap?
retrogametech i had one of dem dey crap
retrogametech it looked like the light on the front was barely on
retrogametech So hard to watch the console that i grew up with die like that. (
retrogametech Diesel powered dreamcast lol
retrogametech Galacticzeldarceus64 In England its blue, getting an NTSC Red would make matters worse.
retrogametech just happened to me this morning. like a scene from mission impossible though I chose not to accept the mission :(
retrogametech This guy sounds like one of the guys form Call Of Duty MW2
retrogametech RetroGameTech to bad this not the prob with mine
retrogametech shutuptv100 in europe it was changed to blue as a company owned the rights to a orange swirl as there logo the comp was Tivola
retrogametech i think i smelt that from here
retrogametech Cool... in a way lol.
retrogametech hey mate, i blew my psu too.. can i just ask: what did u replace? was it the whole psu, or just the blown capacitor? thanks. im no good with electronics, but if replacing the capacitor fixes it then its going to save me quite a bit of money. cheers
retrogametech jeffhardy300wwe At least the dreamcast will always be better than your spelling.
retrogametech Thats a controller port and the conexion to the motherboard problem...
retrogametech lXlNismo11lXl that shit is elite )
retrogametech RetroGameTech Oh, Cool, I thought that because of the soft light of the power light. Is there any tutorial to do it? You should do one if isnt
retrogametech Was that smoke blue? If so, awsome!
retrogametech this happened with one of my sega saturns but it was the cd drive that went up in smoke
retrogametech Take that Xbox RROD  at least they dont smoke when they break
retrogametech joshhsega Dont worry, It got repaired ) . All it needed was a new PSU.
retrogametech bit of me just dead seeing this.

screenjunkies Because eagles do not let the dwarves there?Simple because there is a motherfucker dragon ...
screenjunkies I loved the first movie of The Hobbit, but they could do just one movie or at least two movies. Three movies are way too many for a short book.
screenjunkies honest trailers game of thrones please

screenjunkies the guy is fucking nuts but hes living the dream so fair play and all the best to him
screenjunkies This video is truth ful though
screenjunkies Do a honest trailer for transfomers prime
screenjunkies They have helped me out already. My link may be waaaaaay down in the video descriptions but theyve gotten me a lot of subscribers and views. I asked permission to do this a while back.
screenjunkies never heard of this guy but doesnt look like i could stand him very much
screenjunkies This was freaking awesome!!!!!
screenjunkies Youre hilarious Jon. Tell Sean I said happy birthday!
screenjunkies Say: Man Fuck the police
screenjunkies Hahaha are you friends with any other youtube reviewer? This roastnest trailer rocks!
screenjunkies Big Kids love this video.
screenjunkies omg this is so funny!
screenjunkies Only so much time. :)
screenjunkies thats one of the pet peeves i have of his videos... doing the voice over things when he cant change his voice.. but he does have great toys and reviews. and im prettyjealous he got on the toy review videos first cuz i would love to do what he does. also... his apartment looks way too crowded... he needs to get a bigger place for all his toys! happy birthday sean and loved this Jon!
screenjunkies Haha true true too true
screenjunkies I thought you pulled honest trailers from screen Junkies lol. I love to watch friends roast each other :P

screenjunkies nenenenenenenenenenenenene batman.
screenjunkies Wow this was just brilliant as usual. Keep up the good work.
screenjunkies Happy birthday Sean long :)
screenjunkies The voice that never hit puberty
screenjunkies I really want to see more parodies of YouTubers now.
screenjunkies I know that this is out of context, but I am really jealous that my friend received a comment from you... and I was the one who showed him the channel!
screenjunkies OMFG that emo guy, boy who never hit puberty, bewbs of Hanna minx (wink), earthquake capital of the world. I love you.
screenjunkies LMFAO! FUNNIEST SHIT EVER MAN!
screenjunkies I subscribed to him....and then unsubscribed when I found out there were other toy reviewers. This may have been a roast but its all true.
screenjunkies Before any Sean Long fans dislike this video and unsubscribe from jon3.0 cause they think Jon is serious, check Seans comments below. CLEARLY these guys are buddies.
screenjunkies initially by making fun of him you are promoting videos
screenjunkies Watha you are a stupid
screenjunkies I liked him waayy back when Transformer reviews were really hot on the scene about 2008. Since then he has just gotten really annoying and repetittive. But I have to say, hes come a long way since then, so good for him!
screenjunkies Ok. Cool. Congrats to him! Also, nice use of Honest Trailers to make new content. I hope Screen Junkies actually makes a nod to you as youve done for them. :D
screenjunkies happy birthday sean long your awesome
screenjunkies best ever! and its all true! sean is really a great guy. 6 dislike!? wtf!!
screenjunkies SEANxLONG!!! Awesome video Jon !!!! And Happy birthday Sean !!!
screenjunkies Only so many hours in a day...
screenjunkies ARTICULATION!!! this is hilarious man! im surprised you didnt mention him saying 360 degrees.
screenjunkies The title is just epic!
screenjunkies He is no pixel Dan. Too bad. It would make him more lickable.
screenjunkies Sean long does good reviews hes lol to
screenjunkies Are you trying to sell this guys channel or satirize, as you describe, his sub par content?
screenjunkies Do one about Shartimus Prime
screenjunkies Wow awesome video Jon! Haha, this was basically the roast of Sean Long.
screenjunkies Maybe for his birthday. :D
screenjunkies Awesome video! I especially like Seans subliminal messages in his videos: GO TO BKBN. NET, GO TO BKBN.NET
screenjunkies I expected dislikes. Not everyone likes or gets roasts between friends.
screenjunkies Nah, this was just a onetime thing. Ill stick to reading the scripts for Screenjunkies.
screenjunkies Im just roasting my friend. Its his 30th birthday. Most of these clips are from 3 or 4 years ago. :) Hes actually a great guy and really close friend. He has close to 100,000 subscribers so people love his videos!
screenjunkies Hilarious, man! But one has to wonder why you didnt bring up buhtins and horrible singing...
screenjunkies How about doing an Honest Trailers about Honest Trailers?
screenjunkies LOL nice. I remember when Sean first got onto YT, those were the days.
screenjunkies This is great, I wish I had friends like this.
screenjunkies I cant stop laughing!

screenjunkies The only thing I dont like about your videos is the way that the sound dramatically changes from quiet to loud, I have to keep changing the volume to cope with that. Otherwise, congratulations on your video making abilities!
screenjunkies Jeremy Jahns and Nostalgia Critic NEED to do a crossover review! Possibly of the Dark Knight Rises... or The Matrix.

screenjunkies AFTER EARTH  TO RUIM ASSIM PRA COMPARAR COM ESSA PORCARIA AI???
screenjunkies Eu acho que The last airbender est no TOP 10 de piores filmes de todos os tempo,mal dirigido,mal interpretado,mal escrito,tudo  errado nesse filme.
screenjunkies Durante quando o narrador fala o Estrelando, d para perceber que ele no se segura, e comea rir! KKKKKKKKKK

screenjunkies 0:03 Are you looking for a Bing themed movie? The Amazing SpiderMan.
screenjunkies Vince Vaughn is a FUCKING WEIRDO!!!
screenjunkies is vince vaughn dead? at that point he should of just walked off. what a retarded interview
screenjunkies The Internship? Ugh, the initial trailer says it all. Cliches and filled with pop culture references instead of original humor.
screenjunkies Coming this summer The GenderBender
screenjunkies Vince Vaughn looked pissed...
screenjunkies WHY WAS SIGNS MORE HATED THAN AFTER EARTH?
screenjunkies inhale cringe exhale loudly
screenjunkies I thought vince vaughn was the guy with 2 dicks...
screenjunkies Gotta be when hal made the lance armstrong crack, then immediately reached for the computer, after Vaughn said he didnt wanna use google.
screenjunkies I thought every one hated The Last Airbender?
screenjunkies Something funny in the coments below! Give me my t shirt.
screenjunkies u told me to say it so i will something funny
screenjunkies I think you annoyed him when you asked about Jennifer ya jackass!
screenjunkies You definitely got on his nerves when you asked about Jennifer Aniston.
screenjunkies The Internship... its a poor excuse for a google advert, calling it a movie would be a huge overstatement. And it makes no sense.Vince Vaughn needs to teach the good nerds how to live. Interestingly this is also the only major difference between the good nerds and the bad nerd.The advert teaches you, that nerds can be either disgusting and geeky, or evil. Nothing else makes sense, but this is almost offensive to me.
screenjunkies 2:41VINCE: oh god whats fucking next
screenjunkies Hal Rudnick  Jewish Richard Simmons
screenjunkies my something funny is do you smell that?I think its your mom.
screenjunkies thats the worst Screen Junkies episode!!!!!!! but still made me smile.
screenjunkies Wow he actually seems like a real person. A lot of the stars at junkets are jerks.
screenjunkies Seriously Hal, that was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies damnn he is a really nice guy
screenjunkies mmmmmh... pretty terrible and not funny :S
screenjunkies I think he was most annoyed when you yanked on his hair. That was hilarious!!!
screenjunkies The Jennifer Aniston part.
screenjunkies was vince serious about getting arrested
screenjunkies It was obviously when he asked why Jennifer Aniston left Vince Vaughn. Because it obviously didnt happen the other way round.
screenjunkies he seems like he has something to hide i think he has a porno out
screenjunkies I play a drinking game, where I drink every time Hal blinks... permanently shitfaced...
screenjunkies Is it just me or is he angry
screenjunkies I think its at 2:11 where he even isnt vince vaughn cause he already said he wish he was dead.
screenjunkies Something funny... :P
screenjunkies God, this interview cringes me.
screenjunkies While The Last Airbender is abhorrently bad, After Earth is much worse.
screenjunkies Where do you most get on Vince Vaughns nerve? Right here, Vince Vaughn Googles Himself! where he is looking offscreen at his agentmanager trying to feel when how to get your ass yanked.
screenjunkies The very second you said you were gonna use google to ask questions lol
screenjunkies Vince Vaughn sucks!!!
screenjunkies Haha, it was when he looked at the cameraagent with a WTF look at 2:24.
screenjunkies i think you lost him with the anniston bit budy
screenjunkies I always think Vince Vaughn comes across as a twat
screenjunkies lol you can tell vince vaughn was so annoyed with the google questions but he handled it well
screenjunkies Easily the Aniston part
screenjunkies Lolol i saw that after school special in health
screenjunkies Something funny hey, Vince likes Mince
screenjunkies screw you Hal, Im fourteen and I was looking forward to watching the Sixth Sense.
screenjunkies Throughout this video there is a Pee Wee Herman doll behind you and that got me thinking  are you related?
screenjunkies atleast the last airbender had a cool name, i mean come on..the happening? wtf? something is going on and its not right...making people crazy, a worldwide epidemic causing mass suicide..hmmm lets call it the happening since it happens to be happening at this moment of happeningness..
screenjunkies This film was utter shite
screenjunkies People responded well to the film? Ha! Hahaha! HAHAHahahah! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
screenjunkies Something funny... Wheres my fucking shirt?!
screenjunkies Your so money by the way
screenjunkies Is vince vaughns character going to be found in the the new jurassic park movie that is coming out?
screenjunkies When you waved goodbye at the end you reminded me of the retarded policeman...
screenjunkies Must watchVince Vaughn Googles Himself!At the end they talk about the worst M. Night shamalamadingdong movie. Very funny.
screenjunkies This is so awkward its hilarious
screenjunkies He got most annoyed when you asked him about Jennifer Anniston
screenjunkies does anyone else notice that Hal always seems on edge? He gets these mini twitches on the right side of his face...
screenjunkies Think you struck a nerve there with the whole Jen Anniston spiel
screenjunkies Hals been pumping that iron.
screenjunkies VInce no likee interview
screenjunkies i think you pissed him off when he was like guess who fell down right before the finish line and you like lance Armstrong and he was all like no no.... peter bilingsle
screenjunkies M night shamalanadingdong!!
screenjunkies I got spoiled by Lonely Island on Sixth Sense
screenjunkies when you asked why he left that girl
screenjunkies Suddenly I like Vince Vaughn.
screenjunkies I can win a shirt if I say something funny? If I say something unfunny, can I win some underwear? I need a new pair.
screenjunkies I think he was annoyed when you asked him if he was dead.
screenjunkies Do RED for the release of RED 2!!!
screenjunkies Happy Birthday, Joe! I hope everyone is nice to you this evening.
screenjunkies happy birthday shoesy!
screenjunkies Happy Birthday (belated) Joe. I had 2 miss the live broadcast 4 work but ill catch it on iTunes this wknd. I hope u had a good time. C U  the movies. L8r
screenjunkies I like Paul Walker better! But between those two muscles with feet...vin diesel
screenjunkies the most efficient way to make that thing fast is to remove ALL of its parts and replace them with all parts of an already fast car.
screenjunkies Using that FWD Scion XB to drift? HAHAHAHA. Youd have to do an expensive RWD conversion to it like Tanner Fousts TC.
screenjunkies The questions are dumb, in fact hes visibly annoying one of the mechanicsI thought you where going to ask technical questions not troll the mechanics with retarded questions.
screenjunkies This guy is straight up clowning. Too funny...
screenjunkies How to make a scion fast.........Buy a Honda accord.
screenjunkies I understood basically all of the technical jargon in this video just by playing War Thunder.
screenjunkies We all know Nick Mundys answer.
screenjunkies Most of the action sequences in FF, for that matter other car chase movie, are filmed at lower speeds. Then they dub in more engine noise in post production. The opening scene of the first FF movie , where they were hijacking the truck is pure Hollywood.
screenjunkies Hahaha, definitely not only that blonde guy now
screenjunkies I love screen junkies, but dude. This shit sucks.( in my movie trailer voice)
screenjunkies Jeff seem like a cool guy to roll a Heisenberg, what his number?
screenjunkies The Rock acts a whole lot better so...THE ROCKBut....Vin Diesels mumbling is sort of one of a kind.Hmmm
screenjunkies Well both of them are overglorified action stars but at least Rock speaks his lines and doesnt do that god awful mumbling...
screenjunkies Vin diesel he used to be a bouncer at a night club in NYC
screenjunkies Depends what are they doing?? Arm wrestling definitely Vin Diesel but wrestling would be the rock
screenjunkies Choosing between vin diesel and the rock is like choosing between a broken arm and a broken leg.... i would choose the rock because vins a broken leg and i hate crutches
screenjunkies Turns out I cant afford to be fast.. and that makes me FUURRIOUS!!! LMFAO
screenjunkies I like both actors ,but The Rock dressing in a Pink Tutu !? The Rock wins because he can pull off a Pink Tutu and still be cool :)
screenjunkies Drop it out of a plane! LOL!
screenjunkies LOL!! ScreenJunkies finds some actual mechanics to break down the mechanics of The Fast and Furious
screenjunkies for all those planning to watch fast  furious 6. keep in mind: way to get ur car up 190mph is to drop from an airplane.
screenjunkies I like a Rock. I mean, THE rock.
screenjunkies Vin Diesel is better than The Rock because while Vin Diesels acting seriously leaves something to be desired, compared to watching The Rocks acting selfmutilation seems preferable.
screenjunkies A Scion xb drift? The real answer is no not without a drive train swap. Fwd cars dont drift, they power slide.
screenjunkies If I wanted to street race this scion what would I wanna do to it? Trade it in for something else.
screenjunkies Find someone less annoying than this guy to do the videos. Honest trailers is a 9.610. This guys video is a 2.410
screenjunkies The rock. At least he has some good movies and the occasional emotion. All vin diesel can do is whisper very intensely. That and the rock is a beast, vin is actually very short
screenjunkies If I wanted to street race this scion, what should I do ....buy a faster car
screenjunkies worst movie series ever.
screenjunkies LoL! Fast  Furious  made me leave the movie theatre fast  furious  so from a wicked perspective they did deliver the motto of the film perfectly.
screenjunkies Hey Hal, I like to watch your mom
screenjunkies What is a supercharger? What is an intake manifold? What is an engine system?
screenjunkies Yo, fuck you, hes great.
screenjunkies I always thought it was pancakes.
screenjunkies Hey Hal, I like to watch your mom
screenjunkies MUST DO A HONEST TRAILER FOR THE PURGE..............NOWWWWWWWW
screenjunkies You can rotate the cabin 180 degrees making it a RWD car
screenjunkies Do an honest trailer of iron man 3
screenjunkies What is a supercharger? What is an intake manifold? What is an engine system?
screenjunkies Yo, fuck you, hes great.
screenjunkies You want us to pick whos better between The Pacifier or The Tooth Fairy? Can suicide be a choice?
screenjunkies I always thought it was pancakes.
screenjunkies If youre still trying to decide whos better between Vin Diesel or The Rock you should ask them both to beat you to a pulp and see who was better at it. Better yet, have someone record it and upload it and well let you know in the comments.
screenjunkies You are not funny which makes me wonder why your honest trailers are!
screenjunkies The rock was in wwe and could beat the other mans ass
screenjunkies The Rock did Doom  Vin Diesel never did anything that bad.
screenjunkies All we need is Stallone and we have Fast, Furious and Expendables :)
screenjunkies well, Vin Diesel can see in the dark. The Rock can raise an eyebrow. cant chooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooose
screenjunkies The Peoples Champion. ...That is all...
screenjunkies Rock, scissor , diesel.. wait what?
screenjunkies Is he your boyfriend?
screenjunkies Vin Diesel, hands down. Water has the power to wear down and destroy The Rock, whereas Vin, with a lower specific gravity, would simply float on top.
screenjunkies I thought this would be a group of physicists completely deconstructing the immense stupidity and absolute ignorance of the laws of physics displayed in the movie. If that is not a thing yet, that needs to be a thing. Somewhere.
screenjunkies Van dissel, the rock or heisanberg!!! Witch one!!
screenjunkies I think The Rocks ego problem is what sets them apart. Unless hes learned some humility over the years.
screenjunkies How much would it cost in modifications to get this thing up to 190mph? I think the fastest way to do that would be to drop it out of a plane Oh man this is fucking gold!
screenjunkies twas a yacht not a boat.
screenjunkies Ask Nick Mundy whos better: The Rock or Vin Diesel.
screenjunkies they made a 6? why? do people actually watch that!?!?!?
screenjunkies NW independent german auto repairs represented by Latino guy with Hitler mustash or so :) u wouldnt believe but my PC soundcard broke down on it with downsampling from 41. khz to like 800Hz...
screenjunkies ride or die? AND WHY ONLY ONE TSHIRT FOR WOMEN?! I WANT THE HONEST TRAILER ONE :(
screenjunkies Ok, those tshirts suck.
screenjunkies Looks like youre getting a screenjunkies tshirt.
screenjunkies I kinda want to punch Mark in the face...
screenjunkies Rock beats paper.. And Vin Diesel
screenjunkies All the way with Vin, oh ya Id let him in, just drop it in the slot, cuz man this guy is HOT!!
screenjunkies A robot can act with more passion an believability then Vin Diesel can
screenjunkies the rock. hes taller. otherwise, theyre both pretty much the same: gentle giants who are known for playing tough guys.
screenjunkies Vin because he has a big ass vein on his head when he fights the rock
screenjunkies Bryce Dallas Howard as Dr. Crusher
screenjunkies I cannot disagree with Hugh Jackman as Picard. Hes the only character who would have that warmth that Patrick Stewart brought to the role. Of the three, Hughs the only one I can see saying, Make it so, in a manner similar to Patricks
screenjunkies Dude Patrick Stewart has not changed in like 30 years, He could still be Picard, Brent Spiner could still be Data. Not sure about anyone else, but those 2 yeah
screenjunkies and you forgot Q or would you have the original
screenjunkies I said it once and Ill say it again, Vin Diesel for Picard.
screenjunkies Picard  Tom hardy  he already played a younger Picard in a photo and his clone (Shinzon) in NemesisRiker  Richard MaddenWorf  Idris Elba or MJWData  Tom Hiddleston Geordi  Donald GloverTroi  Michelle DockeryCrusher  Christina Hendricks
screenjunkies I would have james mcavoy as Picard and Jim parsons as data... Just think about it.
screenjunkies You forgot Tasha Yar, which would be in at least the first TNG movie reboot. Played by Charlize Theron.
screenjunkies BIG FACEPALMNO NO and NO again no fucking next generation crap!That show ruined the franchise!Pickard was a complete wimp and Worf was fun but there was way too much klingon bullshit!The only truly original character was Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg).And for every new series they made the more screwed up the entire story got!The reboot movies were good but they did make them AU for a reason!!!
screenjunkies Charles ShaughnessyBradley CooperMichael Jay WhiteTom HiddlestonJon Michael HillSibel KekilliLily TailorDanai Gurira...and if you REALLY want to count Wesley in,.... Nathan Vetterlein
screenjunkies Question: Why would they reboot this? Why would anyone be interested in seeing a reboot, other than some douchie little trekkers?
screenjunkies For Dr. Crusher, I replace with Jewel Belair Staite.
screenjunkies if this movie was made with the choices you made  i would consider seeing it.... on dvd!
screenjunkies DO NOT TOUCH THE NEXT GENERATION!! THEY HAVE ALREADY FED UP THE ORIGINAL CAST.
screenjunkies What was wrong with Frakes acting in the show? I thought he did a good job.
screenjunkies I think that instead of making all these reboots and sequels, someone in Hollywood need to come up with an original ideal. And we need an all new Star Trek series on TV ...
screenjunkies I think they should reboot Seaquest DSV or Space above and beyond.
screenjunkies I try to take an objective side in debates like this. But this guy, this first guy on the far left in the red shirt.My initial thoughts when I heard Reboot TNG were: Just dont.Then after that when I was hearing the reasons and characters: 0:51 to 1:10 I just wanted to staple the guys mouth shut.I havent seen breaking bad, Ive got a long list of stuff to watch, but from what that guy says, this Heisenberg is nowhere near what JeanLuc Picard is as a character. Maybe its my inner Trekkie, but from the moment he started talking I could just feel the rage bubbling up from my gut. It wasnt the bad rage, it was the passionate rage. I love TNG, I just dont want it to become something that its not. Im midway through a Tolkien movie crisis because the Hobbit films are pretty much shitting on my hopes at the moment. (Maybe this is how the star wars diehards feel)
screenjunkies NNNNNooooooooooooo!!!! These fucking movies should have NEVER BEEN MADE AT ALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies firefly!!! Just bring it back!
screenjunkies How about making original movies for once?
screenjunkies Id reboot Breaking Bad and heres my dream castHugh Jackman as Walter WhiteJake Lloyd as Jesse PinkmanChristopher Reeve as Hank SchraderRussell Crowe as Saul GoodmanIdris Elba as Gus FringGwneth Paltrow as Skyler WhiteAnd I would have The Coen Brothers as director
screenjunkies J.J. should reboot the original Battlestar Galactica.
screenjunkies Please no leave it alone already its time to cut jj from Trek
screenjunkies I hope they dont reboot it if they dont have Patrick Stuart. Lets face it, Picard is only Picard because of Patrick Stuart. Take that away and its no longer Picard.
screenjunkies I got Better idea. Why dont we do a Star Trek Voyager Reboot with the Muppets. And Have Miss Piggy as Captain Janeway.
screenjunkies Im sorry but I cant see anyone else playing PicardPatrick Stewart is the ONE AND ONLY Picard!
screenjunkies no no no no no no NO NO NO NO NOOOOOOOOOO!
screenjunkies Although I think its good that they give their own dream cast (which is basically just their opinion), I quite disagree with who theyre picking.Dont get me wrong, the actors they chose are good actors, but..To me, the cast or TNG was quite young.. I dont know the real ages of the actors who played Data or Geordi or anyone else when they were in TNG, but they all look around twenty to thirty years old. (Except Picard ofcourse) I hope that IF they reboot TNG, they pick young looking actors and put A LOT of effort into it. Go big or go home. You know that if you dont do it good, youll get hate from the fandoms :(I came across a good example of an actor who could play Data, Tom Hiddleston. If you look it up on Google youll find some photoshopped pictures of Tom as Data and they look quite good to me :)
screenjunkies I just wanna be Harry Mudd in a stolen alien spaceship, tooling around Fed Space with my girls. lol
screenjunkies Holy crisp on a Turkey... I didnt think that much of the choices individually, but in that final pic with them all together I would watch the sht out of that show!
screenjunkies I still think they should bring the original TNG cast together to make So Very Tired. It wouldnt be the twelfth movie, but it would at least be a movie.
screenjunkies Ayelet Zurher (Lara LorVan, Supermans birthmom in Man Of Steel) as Deanna Troi.
screenjunkies Picard Patrick StewartRiker Bradley CooperWorf Samuel l Jackson Data Tom HiddlestonLaforge Chiwetel Ejofor
screenjunkies tom cruise !?!? nooooo
screenjunkies Personally, I think Cranston is too old to play Picard, Picard was younger when he first started.
screenjunkies Bryan cranson is not playing anymore bald characters. Get over it fanboys. Breaking bad is over.
screenjunkies In a few years perhaps they can do the original cast of this and any other remake of any kind, as utterly flawlessly realistic computer generated characters, so still Bil Shatner or Patrick Stewart, or even the late DeForest Kelley and (pardon my forgetfullness whoever played the original Scotty)
screenjunkies That yellow shirt doesnt agree with him!
screenjunkies XD keep it whoopy made my night
screenjunkies Tom Cruise as data??? haaaa
screenjunkies My two cents because I cant help myself. Picard: Cyril Raffaelli Riker: Gerard Butler. Data: Ryan Reynolds. Geordi La Forge: Chiwetel Ejiofor Dr Crusher: Olivia Coleman Troy: Summer Glaue. Tasha Yar: Gwendoline Christie. Warf: Brian Thompson. Guiana: Alfre Woodard.
screenjunkies Funny that they mentioned Lost to Star Trek not being a very huge leap, I think Terry OQuinn would be a good Picard.
screenjunkies i vote for the original crew and for abrams to be thrown in the brig
screenjunkies The idea of rebooting TNG is terrifying, especially if its done as terribly as TOS. Neither series needed or needs rebooting, they are perfectly fine as they are. The Abrams movies are basically hollowed out, poorly written, and soulless shells of what Star Trek was, is, and should always be. Whoever wrote these abominations either had never watched Star Trek, or any of the meaning went right over their heads. DO NOT REBOOT TNG, EVER. Youve already fucked over pretty much every other Scifi series that was good, go mess up Star Wars and leave Trek alone.
screenjunkies Lol lets keep it Whoopi
screenjunkies just recast the office as the cast of the next gen crew
screenjunkies 24 still with Kiefer Southerland
screenjunkies JJ Abrams should reboot: Gremlins, but make it in space
screenjunkies Thunder cats. you guys can choose the cast.
screenjunkies Im gonna go with Bruce Willis for Picard(its a stretch), Kyle Chandler for Ryker, Marlon Wayans for La Forge, Morris Chestnut for Worf, Toby Maguire as Data, Anne Hathaway for Troi, Asa Butterfield as Wesley C., Jessica Chastain as Beverly C., Katee Sackhoff as Lt. Yar, and Gabrielle Union as Guinan
screenjunkies dude is abrams got his hands on NextGeneration it would actually, literally, no joke, kill people from the badness.
screenjunkies Alex Kingston as Beverly Crusher
screenjunkies Star trek will never ever again be star trek, The star trek that us real fans know and love sadly will not sell to the simple minded majority who are looking for pretty explosions, over the top fight scenes, drama, and sex appeal. Anything with the name star trek in the future will be made for those with the idiocracy mindset.
screenjunkies I would prefer Hugh Jackman over Walter White for Picard. I dont think I would be able to take Worf seriously if Terry Crews played him.
screenjunkies worf doesnt need to be black
screenjunkies Such bad choices for DATA man.Tom Cruise??? Haley Joel Osment??? Joseph GordenLevitt??? serious???There is only one Tom who can do Data.TOM HIDDLESTON. He looks just like Data.And is a great actor.
screenjunkies this is just sad i hope that patrick stewart is long dead before picard is recasted in his place and focus on the current startrek cast. the first star trek had i think five movies and years before tng was broadcasted and if the show is reboot im sure the fans will be pleased to see star trek still active but im writing a fanfiction apart from any current star trek time line with naomi wieldman is an aging admiral in star fleet becuase rather then recasting an old franchise i think we should move on and boldly go where no man has gone before.
screenjunkies Picard: Ive heard Viggo Mortensen suggested as a possible Picard... I could see that, maybe, but getting a stage actor would probably be the way to go.Riker: Will WheatonData: Michael FassbenderTroi: Thora Birch (will someone PLEASE give her work?)Worf: Idris ElbaLaforge: perhaps Anthony MackieCrusher: Jennifer Tilly (the captains love interest cant be extremely young)Guinan: Keep it Whoopie.And Ill give you a bonus Patrick Wilson as Barclay. Jim Parsons is a wholly worthless actor and you guys should be ashamed for bringing him up. He might do a decent Eugene Victor Tooms, but thats the extent of his reboot usefulness.The one thing a reboot would absolutely need is zero involvement by that vampire J. J. Abrams. A disinterested mercenary director like him might be able to bring in lots of money by stripmining the culture, but he cant create anything new or interesting and whatever he touches turns to crap. Meanwhile, actual creators get shut out. Its a poisonous cycle.
screenjunkies obvious choice would be for abrams to bring back man from uncle ( yeah i know theyre making a movie )
screenjunkies dude wtf they picked young actresses for dr. crusher but in the series she was older like picard. i woulda gone with julianne moore. she would be fuckin perfect
screenjunkies Couldnt we just do a new TNG movie with the original cast, with Bryan Cranston as the villain or something?
screenjunkies What a shitty beam out.
screenjunkies Samuel L. Jackson as Worf, because a Klingon that says mother fucker a lot would be pretty sweet.
screenjunkies Please make this happen
screenjunkies huge jackoff as picard ... you sir should be shot
screenjunkies I think he should reboot Firefly
screenjunkies I vote for Jim Parsons (The Big Bang Theory Sheldon Cooper)
screenjunkies There.....are.....four....Lights
screenjunkies sorry guys, but Ive never seen such a bunch of lame stupid people! Kevin (the second on the left) is the only one who still has a brain. The dude with the yellow shirt just belongs to an asilum for retarded
screenjunkies Jim Parson for Data!!! Are we even discussing this?
screenjunkies Ralph Fiennes  Captain JeanLuc PicardMichael Fassbender  William T. RikerChiwetel Ejiofor  Geordi La ForgeMarion Cotillard  Deanna TroiWalton Goggins  DataDjimon Hounsou  WorfAlex Kingston  Beverly CrusherYvette Nicole Brown  GuinanLast and certainly least Christopher MintzPlasse  Wesley Crusher
screenjunkies i think JJ abrams should be the janitor on some of the upcoming good movies so he has a chance of picking up some pointers on how to direct . Seriously star trek he turns spok into a gibbering cry baby , kirk into a dumb jock , uhuru into a complete idot , scotty into a skinny retard and rehashes all the ship design . the movie should have been star trek with great effects new ships and setting designs a story that was just not possible to visualise in the 70s and even further story developement of the series , instead we get twenty somethings with teenage problems in a disney theme park ride , for the love of god get him away from star wars
screenjunkies i dont like jj abrams stuff id rather make it myself
screenjunkies Am I the only one that thinks if theyre going to reboot TNG, couldnt Patrick Stewart reprise his role? After all, seeing as theyre sort of in the same (but if thing turned out differently) universe, surely you would want them to look fairly similar (i.e. Zachary Quinto could be a younger Leonard Nimoy).The age factor doesnt really need consideration seeing as Patrick Stewart looks pretty much the same no as he did then.
screenjunkies I hate the way they only want Cranston to play the same character he does in Breaking Bad, I am sure he good enough an actor to be just as dignified and diplomatic in his own way, perhaps with a fake French accent, and not have to play the same character as in Breaking Bad. The shows over! And I am sad to say that Next Generation is over too, its been a couple decades now, but most of the cast is still alive, and reboots are an extreme artistic cop out anyway, its almost as if scifi has officially declared itself dead by reducing itself to dystopias, reboots, and superhero movie after superhero movie, and with so many chubby males 3060 losing their shit over something that is like 88 CG, like video games they are too lazy to play. Its like peoples imaginations are so destroyed they rely on others like it was a drug.
screenjunkies ...lets keep it Whoopi... xD That was priceless.
screenjunkies Marion Cotillard FTW!
screenjunkies The reboot movies suck because the narrative got so far stuck up there own asses all I could see was shit.
screenjunkies Its still too soon to reboot next gen without keeping the original cast. Theres no reason they couldnt just create new characters, and a new ship for that matter.
screenjunkies hopefully jj has a tragic accident that makes him realise that he absolutely sucks. and has a revelation that makes him stop making film all together
screenjunkies Patrick Stewart will always be the best
screenjunkies Why must everything good be fucked up??? There already is a Star Trek The Next Generation, just leave it alone. They have already destroyed Star Wars and V, could you at least leave us TNG???
screenjunkies Idris Elba for Worf :)
screenjunkies Michael looks like Christopher Walkens fat nephew.
screenjunkies Jj abrams kills movies...
screenjunkies Jason Momoa as Worff, maybe?You know, Khal Drogo...
screenjunkies Crowdsourced campaign to stop celebrity Kickstarter projects
screenjunkies I do love me some Zach braff, but this seems kind of shameless, Zach
screenjunkies DontBackZach Hah! Sign me up.Indie GoGo: http:igg.meatdontbackzachScreenJunkies ZachBraff Kickstarter
screenjunkies I just backed Zack. Thanks for the reminder. I might have totally forgotten to add his project.
screenjunkies If its always to see anyone full retard, its just disheartening to see some of your favorite entertainers go FULL retard.
screenjunkies The reason he wouldnt want Denzel making a cameo is he isnt in bro love with him. Donald would be charming, Denzel would be out of place.
screenjunkies Hooch is going to find this guy and mow him down. Heavy on the bass.
screenjunkies Well, because he literally ASKED THEM and the people said yes and donated. Welcome to democracy.
screenjunkies He already has the funding....
screenjunkies Oh, and Ill have to defer to Mel Brooks on the two rules to funding a production from the musicalplay The Producers Rule number one. Never Ever Never use your own money. Max Whats rule number Two Max?  Bloom NEVER USE YOUR OWN MONNNEEEEEEEEYYYYYY!!!!  Max, very loud.
screenjunkies Goddammit Hitler. I though you died
screenjunkies Cant tell if trolling. . .or just trolling.
screenjunkies I find it hilarious how only 746 was raised XD
screenjunkies Now I HAVE to go donate to Zach whom I love as an actor and his last movie (even though it was hard to find), discouraging people to donate to anything they like is fucking stupid. Theres a reason in 10 days youve only made about 700, this is such a juvenile use of Kickstarter. I dont care how rich he is, this is more than asking for money, hes trying to establish an audience that is actually invested emotionally and monetarily in what hes doing.
screenjunkies No cares if you unsubscribe (again). Let him make his video, he want to, enjoy yourself and shut the fuck up.
screenjunkies No, Donald faison ftw! I love zack Braff, no one has to donate, its voluntary
screenjunkies Good try, Hal. talking about money of people who has it and then asking for it... Nah, lets just call it a try.
screenjunkies I love Zach and thanks to this clip I am going to donate on kickstarter. First I was like nah, Zach and the other fans can pull it off. But this prick helped me to tie the knot.
screenjunkies That doesnt automatically mean theyre being serious about this. Its a stupid kickstarter. The guy doesnt even seem serious when hes going on about it. Its obviously a joke.
screenjunkies Umm, you want money to take money away from someone else? that sounds really useful
screenjunkies Youre obviously a manipulative prick. You referred to yourself as an underdog, and you have obviously found the means to attempting to tear down something somebody SUCCESSFUL created, because their creations actually got them somewhere. Youre a dick raging at a camera trying to ruin somebody elses creation. Second off, you clearly havent looked into this NEARLY as much as you should have. Youre sharing your opinion as fact, and factual evidence is virtually completely absent.
screenjunkies Yes thank you. This bullcrap with celebrities asking for money for freaking vanity projects is making me sick. You assholes have money and the resources to find your own backing. Kickstarter is for those that do not. fucking leeches. I hope Zach Braff never works again.
screenjunkies ScreenJunkies has been at 656 for TEN DAYS!! Zach Braff made 1.5 million dollars in a few!
screenjunkies Lmfaoo at the Mariah Carey part
screenjunkies Kickstarter seems real simple. Dont think a project deserves your donation, dont give them money. I really dont understand the fuss.
screenjunkies Well if your belittling the one so called argument as if its no big deal that major companies shadow smaller ones we have nothing to discuss. Honestly I have no idea why your so up in arms about this move on.
screenjunkies Yeah so I dont think this is working out for you screen junkies.. The internet is mad at you, real mad
screenjunkies Donate 50 dollars and get an exclusive limited run tshirt. Funny because Im like Yo! Thats 50 dollars for a tshirt. Limited edition, lets do some simple addition, 50 dollars for a tshirt, thats just some ignorant bitch.
screenjunkies So how do we solve this. Force people not to donate to rich people? Or force people not to create money campaigns when they already make a certain amount of money. Either way, that seems like a lack of freedom in all aspects. Why should we control what people want to start kicking and donating?
screenjunkies Why so many dislikes lol
screenjunkies Yeah...why dont we donate 2 million to keep people from making a movie. How about a 10 million dollar campaign to tell people what they shouldnt spend their money on.
screenjunkies Looking at how the Dont back Zach campaign is going, it looks like people have already spoken. Sorry Screen junkies just because someone has a ton of money doesnt mean that they should use all their money before finding a backer for their next project.
screenjunkies Well this guy is a jackass.
screenjunkies Is this supposed to be satirical?
screenjunkies I agree with this in principle. I do not agree to the hypocrisy of your proposed solution. If it were proposed ironically, it would be funny. But, Im pretty sure there is no irony here...
screenjunkies What if he just wanted people involved with it I mean seriously .....why not make a video on Matt Damon trying gr
screenjunkies Unless this is some form of metatrolling where you purposefully become hypocrites to reveal the stupidity of the situation, this is fucking stupid. Dont back people with money to do vanity projects that they could fund themselves, now fund us to make a vanity project that we could fund ourselves. GENIUS TROLLING OR COMPLETE HYPOCRISY! I agree that perhaps the money could be put to better use or other projects by those with less financial clout but really? Not worth an Indiegogo campaign :P

screenjunkies It someone forcing you to back him on Kickstarter? I dont get it, if you dont like it, dont give him money... why is there even a controversy? How does it really effect your life if anyone starts a Glitter 2 Kickstarter? Just ignore it and move on with your day.
screenjunkies Screen junkies sure sounds mad. Y u mad, screen junkies?
screenjunkies Ye, cos obviously people want to donate their money for a joke.... Mabey I should give my life savings to my mate, uno...for the lols
screenjunkies ...so..youre telling us to not funding by funding?
screenjunkies did he pay you money to say that...because you know, hes fucking rich.
screenjunkies Telling us not too back someone with lots of money as they can probably afford it by giving you lots of money to do something you can probably afford to do too. Good effort Screen Junkies, lost some faith in you here.
screenjunkies Zach Braff isnt worth 22 million and it doesnt seem like you know anything about making decent movies. Let people back the things they want to see. Why are you taking away from him for trying to do the things he wants? Also, his appearance on kickstarter put 500000 into unrelated projects and brought 40,000 people to the site. So why is this bad? Why so bitter?
screenjunkies Why not do this to honey boo boo, would be much more constructive in my opinion.
screenjunkies Was this for real? Dont give the guy whos going to make A FUCKING MOVIE that you might want to see money, instead give us money to help protest giving the other guy money so we can print an ADVERTISEMENT telling people not to give the guy who is MAKING A MOVIE money? Fuck, youre stupid.
screenjunkies Agreed my Jewish friend.
screenjunkies This is dumb. Ive lost respect for screen junkies.
screenjunkies I dont get why people dont understand this. Just because he is worth 22 million, doesnt mean he has that much liquid cash in the bank! Net worth includes the value of his possessions, including a house, car, any stocks etc. Just because he has 22 mill net worth doesnt mean he can spare around 6 million for the movie. He already stated he is using a lot of his own cash for it. And clearly he felt that whatever his pocket could afford wasnt enough, so he is getting more cash from kickstarter
screenjunkies Man finally somebody gets the picture. all i see is all this hate when the campaign is more that what people are thinking it to be. I backed even though i knew it was going to fail.we ar not hating zach. Because zach braff is going to succeed, we are looking at hollywood using sites like kickstarter to fund projects thatovershadow people who are trying to fund their films that have neither the connections or money.
screenjunkies And just who the hell is this guy to think that he gets to decide who or what kickstarter is for? Love the channel, kinda hating this douchebag.
screenjunkies screenjunkies, I dont know your exact purpose (and im willing to admit that, because it isnt important) but an organization hating on one person isnt exactly commendable. You guys let this guy get in front of a camera without any REAL factual evidence that what Zach Braff is doing is wrong. It makes everyone look bad. If this is the guy presenting on behalf of you guys, does that mean that everybody is at his level? or does it even mean that there is even more ignorance behind the scenes?
screenjunkies Sizzyrup fueled twerk parties... I want all parts of that!
screenjunkies The only good thing about this channel are the honest trailers.
screenjunkies the money going to zach braffs movie could go to a million other more worthwhile causes, especially since zach had already secured funding from worldview entertainment..I approve of using kickstarter as a way to allow fans to get more involvedhave unique experiences like going to screeningsparties. but alot of these things are just riding on veronica mars coattails. VM NEEDED kickstarter because if they couldnt prove they had sufficient support, WB wasnt going to allow filming.
screenjunkies No one is going to give you money we all only subscribe for honest trailers. Yeah Zak is a stupid bitch but no one cares
screenjunkies Dont back Zack! you guys have fallen for his bullshit like a couple of scrubs.
screenjunkies Hello Zach Braff on an alternate youtube account you made with a picture of some douche from a cheap wallet insert.
screenjunkies Funded from three sources when he has the money to back it himself. Im sorry but you know, when you come up with an idea for something and have the money, you should make it with your own money. I thought Kickstarter was more for folks who really couldnt go it alone. Zach just doesnt want to invest all his own money. But then You Tube used to be for the average folk but now its all corporate.
screenjunkies People wanted to see Veronica Mars, so they backed. Melissa Joan Hart just wanted to get money for a movie so she could get back to being a major celeb. Nothing there was appealing to enough people so she was not funded. Zach has been open about his desires for this film, where the money would come from, and why he is using Kickstarter. Do I know Zach? No. Do I believe that he is sincere? Yes. Good enough for me and I get to have a private online screening of the film and hell answer questions!
screenjunkies To all comments I say oh boohoo you pussies. How is this more of a waste then what Zach is doing?
screenjunkies I subscribed, just so i could have the pleasure of UNsubscribing.
screenjunkies Just dont give him money if you dont like the idea?! I mean, its as easy as that. Geez!
screenjunkies Heres food for thought, i found a good cause to donate money too. My hockey gear collection of pro stock hockey gloves. Rich people ask me for money? Cheers bud, i have new gloves coming already.
screenjunkies Even if he makes the movie.....who is going to go see it? Zach Braff fans?? Crickets....frogs.... Exactly. Then who cares???? Stop wasting our time with this (possibly fake, and if it is, its COMPLETELY unfunny) complaining crap.
screenjunkies But he is also a multimillionaire.
screenjunkies So let me get this straight, you are shamelessly collecting money from people to stop people from shamelessly collecting money from people? Wow.
screenjunkies A Syrian Film wouldve been far more innapropriate!
screenjunkies I watched Don Jon with my mom. That was really awkward
screenjunkies they are literally shoving heads up peoples asses
screenjunkies Should I eat the cuttlefish and asparagus, or the vanilla paste?
screenjunkies CUDDLEFISSHSHSHSSHSHHHH
screenjunkies I had to watch Chasing Amy and Watchmen with my pairents... Not fun.
screenjunkies Look hes making butt flaps!
screenjunkies Oh dear Id never put my mum through that haha
screenjunkies CUDDLEFISH!! ( south park )
screenjunkies Make her see The Human Centipede 2 :D
screenjunkies What the hell was that? Ill NEVER see your shit again! I just wanted to see ONE of your videos, and THIS?! Fuck you!
screenjunkies lol The genius of this film is that the worst parts r all implied rather than shown. highly effective disturbing horror. this film is not for everyone. Extreme horror.
screenjunkies Team America. I guess my mom rented it because she thought: Oh puppets! Yeah, not too sure a 7 year old should have been exposed to that movie.
screenjunkies Disgusting. Tom Six is a poor excuse for a human being. He should have kept this filth in his head.
screenjunkies I watched the whole Dexter series with my mum... it got pretty awkward during the sex scenes!
screenjunkies This movie is pretty freaky
screenjunkies that film is a bad porn movie :P
screenjunkies i want someone to make a reaction video to her reation.
screenjunkies When you were going off to your mom about the valuable lesson that could be learned from this movie her reaction was like any good moms would be.
screenjunkies ive never seen this movie and it looks fucking disturbing xP
screenjunkies ..Or, this wouldve been the most annoying YouTube video in the world. Two people silently watching a movie for 6 mins! :P
screenjunkies Mom! Youre missing the best part. Jeeez :D
screenjunkies Ill like for your comment, even though I dont agree... I learned alot from that film! :P
screenjunkies This lady is awesome.
screenjunkies That is the most grossest movie ever
screenjunkies I feel sorry for your mom
screenjunkies The most awkward and disturbing film Ive ever watched with my parents is Happiness by Todd Solondz. The film deals with rape, murder, depression, suicide, domestic violence, paedophilia, masturbation, cumshots, a pervert making obscene phone calls to random women, and some of the most awkward and just plain wrong fatherson conversations imaginable, and it passes as a comedy, albeit extremely dark. It was an interesting experience watching it with my parents.
screenjunkies starship troopers when the shower scene showed boobs and i was watching with my parents
screenjunkies go and watch a serbian film human centipede is a childs movie compared to a serbian film and if that wasnt sick enough for you watch the vomit gore triology have fun
screenjunkies GROSS DUDE SO GROSS .how whud thay take a bath and dude and the chapenies guy tuck a shit in her moth
screenjunkies what the fuck. the comments you make to your mum are so uncomfortable.
screenjunkies His mothers reaction is priceless! XD
screenjunkies Human  Centipede  Spiders. Brilliant.
screenjunkies man that movie made me throw up
screenjunkies Ok so I really dont think silence of the lambs is gory. I found it more creepy than anything else. But the 2nd human centipede is way worse in so many ways. The first film was gross but not as bad as I was expecting. I would not watch it again though.
screenjunkies Youre blurring the best part
screenjunkies Hugs and kiss to your mom that was just too cute. My mom would not sit though that movie with me and it my favorite.
screenjunkies This movie is fucked up
screenjunkies definitely not a good idea to have tried to watch this whilst eating my breakfast, im sure more came up than went down.
screenjunkies I imagine this movie was awkward to film
screenjunkies The most awkward thing Ive ever watched with my parents, might have been when me and my dad saw The Watchmen in theaters and the sex scene came on. We were both so damn uncomfortable, I saw his arm twitch and raise up a little like he wanted to reach over and cover both our eyes lol
screenjunkies Tom Six YOU ARE A SICK MOTHERFUCKER!
screenjunkies Game of Thrones is definitely the most awkward show I watch with my mother. I would think the reasons why it would be awkward would be quite obvious
screenjunkies dude, your mum is awesome
screenjunkies hahah! your mom is so cute! i love how she covers your eyes and says, dont watch that, i couldnt stop laughing.XD
screenjunkies when i first heard the title human centipede first thing comes to mind is horror genre, a monster with a wierd mixture of human and a massive centipede. Then when my friends told me what its really about, shit goes down, i dont even know why i watched this video but im thankful of them that they blurred the im gonna lose it scenes
screenjunkies Tom Six  Tom Sick lol
screenjunkies my mom inrtoduced me to game of thrones (we both read the books) it is usally not akward,but once she complained because an extra had obviously fake tits :
screenjunkies Im going to have nightmares
screenjunkies I have seen that film
screenjunkies Who would watch that with their mom
screenjunkies I watched crank with my mom....fucking awkward as hell.
screenjunkies the first human centipede is horrible and boring, saw the second one and i loved it, awdward, gross, horrifing great movie
screenjunkies i love shlinders list
screenjunkies Game of Thrones! The part when Joffrey forced a hooker to spank another hooker was so awkward to watch with my mom.
screenjunkies Yea uhm i had to watch emmerdale...
screenjunkies What a fucking wanker. Why in the hell would you make your mother watch this bullshit.
screenjunkies i would fuck his fat bitch of a mom cum in her then pull out and wipe my cum soaked dick over his anonying rat face
screenjunkies At least in the first one, I was able to sit through it fairly easyily. In the second one, I had to force myself to watch it. It just makes me so sick. Glad I watched it though so I dont feel like Im missing something lol.
screenjunkies The perfect mothers day present
screenjunkies Oh god I lived it again...
screenjunkies i want someone to make a reaction video to her reation.
screenjunkies She sounds like Carls mum from South Park
screenjunkies When you were going off to your mom about the valuable lesson that could be learned from this movie her reaction was like any good moms would be.
screenjunkies Iron Man 3 is great?! What Marvel fans wanted?! Fans wanted them to wipe their asses with the comics by turning The Mandarin (Iron Mans archnemesis) into a pathetic, washedup actor?!
screenjunkies Jimmy Tatro is the only good thing in GrownUp 2
screenjunkies I wasnt crazy about Pacific Rim. The action was EPIC, but the story just wasnt interesting to me...
screenjunkies Almost everyone Ive talked to (besides 1) either didnt like Man of Steel or hated it. Why though?! I loved it! Even after seeing it twice, it was awesome!
screenjunkies Whoa, your lists kinda sucked. Fast and Furious? Pacific Rim? I would have actually put Elysium towards the top. Wolverine sucked. 2015 should be interesting. Man of Steel was awesome!
screenjunkies That Schmoesknow dude is wearing a Godzilla shirt. KUDOS
screenjunkies The Lone Ranger is NOT a family movie
screenjunkies Its so weird to watch this with the benefit of hindsight. Not many of their predictions proved correct. It seems Summer 2013 was a pretty big surprise to them all.
screenjunkies Sad thing is, Pacific Rim was the best one and it made the least amount of money.
screenjunkies Amy Nickolson won! Her top 5 were all in the top 5, and although the order was slightly different, she was the only one to do this. She also was the closest to despicable mes outcome, and she was the only one who was right about The Great Gatsby making the top 10. She also was one of two who was right about The Heat making the top 10. Pretty impressive!
screenjunkies DESPICABLE ME WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!
screenjunkies I WANNA GET CHOCOLATE WASTED!!
screenjunkies This is what happened1 iron man 32 despicable me 23 man of steel4 monsters university5 fast and furious6 star trek into darkness7 world war z8 the heat9 were the millers10 the great gatsby
screenjunkies Devin was hilariously wrong about Star Trek and Wolverine
screenjunkies Pacific Rim is awesome!
screenjunkies You know, I don t know why you people didnt like Iron Man 3 or Man of Steel, Iron Man 3 was great, most of you guys say it was full of plot holes, I found a explanation for all of them (except the operation part at the end) and I liked the plot twist, because this is the Marvel CINEMATIC Universe, not the Marvel Universe, are you guys just going to get angry at Age of Ultron because they are making their own Ultron Origin Story without Hank Pym in it? As for Man of Steel the only thing that I didnt like was the fact that Superman killed Zod. Of course this is only my opinion.
screenjunkies PACIFIC RIM way underated
screenjunkies The Wolverine was waayyyy better than Man of Steel. And SpiderMan 3 suuucks.
screenjunkies Wolverine is the best movie of the Summer... No question
screenjunkies Man of steel was one of my favorite movies. Im a fan of the original but MOS just brings action and epicness. Laser vision!!! Are you kidding me!?
screenjunkies Whoa, my faith in you disappeared when you said that Star Trek isnt a popular franchise.
screenjunkies Actual list of top 10 highest grossing movies of summer 2013:1. Iron Man 32. Despicable Me 23. Man of Steel4. Monsters University5. Fast  Furious 66. Star Trek Into Darkness7. World War Z8. The Heat9. The Great Gatsby10. The Conjuring
screenjunkies all of the predictions were wrong.. it so weird how the things went, right?
screenjunkies Man of Steel, Ironman 3, The Wolverine, Pacific Rim, Monsters Unversity, and Despicable Me 2. Sorry, I only had six. I need to watch more movies then!
screenjunkies Its funny watching this vid in 2014, knowing how many of those movies, did infact SUCK.
screenjunkies You cant call Lone Ranger a family movie  unless you have major money to pay for therapy! The movie opens with the villain punching a guy in the chest, pulling out his heart, and then eating it! Any sane parents would join the mass exodus from the theater immediately after the first scene and line up for a refund of the ticket price. Seriously, what was your childhood like if you believe THAT is a good family movie?! You have my pity.
screenjunkies After watching this, I wanted to see how close they were. At least Amy knows how to do her job.Kristian (610)Amy (810)Devin (610)Hal (710)1) Iron Man 3 (409)2) Despicable Me 2 (367)3) Man of Steel (291)4) Monsters University (268.5)5) Fast  Furious 6 (238.7)6) Star Trek Into Darkness (228.8)7) World War Z (202.4)8) The Heat (159.6)9) The Great Gatsby (144.8)10) The Conjuring (137.4)
screenjunkies its what marvel fans want from a marvel movie HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHABULLSHIT!!!!!
screenjunkies ha iron man 3 1st being a good movie.. hahaha
screenjunkies Pacific rim? What does that mean? You no like pasific rim?
screenjunkies Pacific rim and man of steel were utter crap, and iron man 3? Come on!!!!! I had to play it (upon DVD release) like several times just to finish it, bored the crap outta me
screenjunkies Where did you get those numbers? Iron Man 3 made like 1.4 Billionaaronfialho
screenjunkies Wow Devin faragi you say the most hilarious things  iron man 3 is what people want from a marvel movie star trek is garbage and not a popular franchise winny wolverine emo peter is perfect im ROTFL!!!!!
screenjunkies HERE IT IS!!!!                            http:www.ign.comarticles20140110thehungergamescatchingfiretopplesironman3as2013sbiggestdomestichit?abthid52d0574ec75dfd6726000029
screenjunkies Pacific Rim was the best. Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 tied at two for me.
screenjunkies Any chance that youll veer release extended versions of these videos? Id really love to see everyones full thoughts
screenjunkies stop saying Pacific Rim is an original frenchise, cause it is not! Watch some Evangelion anime, thats where PR got all the ideas!
screenjunkies Why are people bashing the Wolverine? I mean yeah Wolverine Origins SUCKED! But I think this was a good comeback and I liked how it was mostly focused on after The Last Stand... Also sucked, and I loved how it brought in Days of Future Past!
screenjunkies results show! bring everyone back. are they that busy!
screenjunkies Man of steel was so Boring! The only reason i survived it was cause i was cracking jokes with my friend about how many scenes were so similar to other movies ! Big cgi piece of shit : the actors were so one dimensional !! Iron Man 3 s story was way better
screenjunkies I dont know about everyone else but iron man sucked, fucking awful movie
screenjunkies Iron Man 3 sucked all kinds of ass in my opinion
screenjunkies That guy on the left is an Assclown.
screenjunkies despicable me 2 beat monsters university the lone ranger and it was the number 1 movie in the world but iron man was only 1 movie in America and I think man of steel beat 10 times better than iron man 3
screenjunkies I cant beleive that critics and other people said iron man 3 was the best iron man movie ever but it turns out to be another stupid film by marvel. Fuck it that movie was fuckin bad
screenjunkies Green lantern You are good to go
screenjunkies The critics were correct on their Lone Ranger prediction
screenjunkies And no one said anything about despicable me 2......
screenjunkies Kristian Harloff, where did you get your shirt. I WANT ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies oh lord these people were so dumb
screenjunkies Iron man 3 is topMovie
screenjunkies In iron man 3 he wasnt even in the suit twice, and the suit was barely even shown!
screenjunkies Wow really?Man of Steel was Great and The Wolverine was emo.????
screenjunkies The Lone Ranger was the biggest bomb of the year wasnt it?
screenjunkies 2013 summer had so much movies I LOVED IT!
screenjunkies you got a video for worst sequels? you should if you dont
screenjunkies Fuck Iron Man 3!!!!! The worst superhero film of 2013
screenjunkies despicable me 2 beat monsters university the lone ranger and it was the number 1 movie in the world but iron man was only 1 movie in America and I think man of steel beat 10 times better than iron man 3
screenjunkies X3, Wolverine Orgins, Electra, Blade 3, Fantastic Four and many more say hello.
screenjunkies actual order 1) Iron Man 3 409 mil 2) Despicable me 362 mil 3) Man of Steel 291 mil 4) Monsters University 266 mil 5) Fast and the Furious 6 238 mil 6) Oz the great and Powerful 234 mil 7) Star Trek Into the Darkness 228 mil 8) World War Z 202 mil 9) The Croods 187 mil 10) The Heat 159 mil
screenjunkies Star Trek and Pacific Rim were both epic movies, Grown ups 2 etc can go fuck themselves :
screenjunkies I hate all these people sometimes.Sometimes I dont mind them
screenjunkies The wolverine is gonna be better than man of steel maybe not more money but it kinda sucks
screenjunkies Apparently most people would rather pay to watch a sequelrebootcomic book adaptation than something new and original. Go figure.
screenjunkies Summer isnt even over!
screenjunkies Grown ups 2 was also good wtf
screenjunkies Video you need to do: PRINCESS BRIDE, DESPICABLE ME 1 OR 2. Things you should say: 1) NO MORE RHYMING NOW I MEAN IT! ANYONE WANNA PEANUT? 2) ALWAYS REMEMBER TO ASK YOURSELF, WHO AMERICAS NEXT TOP MODEL? 3)  MOM CHARLIE BIT ME!!!! Well thats all i have for today thanks! :)
screenjunkies Im so excited for Pacific Rim...I really hope its good. So far Star Trek: Into Darkness and World War Z are my favorite summer movies.
screenjunkies Fast 6: oh you thought I wasnt gonna do well in box office? FUCK YOUR FACTS
screenjunkies That awkward moment when you though iron man 3 was gonna be amazing, until you actually watched it in theaters and was severely disappointed.
screenjunkies Into darkness has made 430 million worldwide I dont think it struggled at all
screenjunkies Man of steel at number one!!!
screenjunkies Pacific Rim was the most awesome movie!
screenjunkies Iron man 3 was great, but Man if Steel was AMAZING! Henry Cavill, Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon!
screenjunkies The lone ranger......
screenjunkies Why isnt Kick Ass 2 on either of their lists!!
screenjunkies The movie everyone wants
screenjunkies I love pacific rim !!! Like I loved CLoud Atlas ! PR is visualy PERFECT (for 2013) ! Cloud Atlas has a deep theme with what is called the chaos theory !!! They are underated but i dont care, I love them ! ( sorry for bad english, french here)
screenjunkies Man of Steel was great! Christopher Nolan can do no wrong.
screenjunkies Can we have a follow up of this video?
screenjunkies He means domestically. It still made over 200 million, but yeah. Lol
screenjunkies I saw Tailor Lautner did comedy this year. It was like death. Hilarious.
screenjunkies I love how all of them had monsters on their list but didnt talk about it...or despicable me 2.
screenjunkies The Devon guy is a fucking idiot... I couldnt handle him
screenjunkies Said Star Trek was dogshit but Man of Steel would be great, wow, dude got buttfucked at cinemas by man of steel.
screenjunkies Whether you think its bad or good, it doesnt matter, its the biggest hit of the summer.
screenjunkies You gotta do more Superfans meet (Actor)
screenjunkies his friend maddawged me HA at least he noticed, that close of marky mark made me laugh so hard
screenjunkies Mark Whalberg looks like he wants to punch him. Haha
screenjunkies Nina Dobrev or Jennifer Lawrence
screenjunkies Mike Tyson, i would just cry and try kissing his feet. Maybe i would be so exited that i would puke or something :D
screenjunkies Class! Whats the song at 3:20?
screenjunkies .....wow...just......wow.
screenjunkies I ate at that Hooters across from the Summit where the Rockets used to play, but now the Summits Joel Osteens church :)
screenjunkies I would like to meet Liam Neeson.
screenjunkies jackie chan!!! i would flip out if i met him!!!and i would ask questions that no other western interviewer have asked....like how many bones have u broken? show us a punch....show us a kickwhats the worst injury u had?? blah blah
screenjunkies I would love to have met Michael Clarke Duncan, but since he passed away not that long ago I wont be able to.
screenjunkies So youre sending Nick to meet The Rock eh? Oh God! I can only imagine the length of the restraining order.
screenjunkies The look on Mark Wahlbergs face haha classic.
screenjunkies How are you a fan of the rock and be fat as fuck, wait, fat as shit?
screenjunkies David Tennant or Matt Smith
screenjunkies I would stalk Bruce Lee if I ever met him. But I can go with Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Donnie Yen, and Tony Jaa...and I would talk about Bruce Lee with them. Hey Jackie, so you and Bruce.. Jet Li...so Bruce... Donnie...So Bruce is your... Tony Jaa...What do you think of Bruce?
screenjunkies I have to go with steve buscemi, i probably would sit there and stare at him for 10 minutes and thered be a weird silence around..so awkward
screenjunkies if i came face to face with chris nolan i would kidnap him and keep him in my basement so he could tell me stories forever. or we could become an inception team
screenjunkies Id blubber like a baby if I ever met Bryan Cranston.
screenjunkies pain and gain was a pretty bad movie. best movie in ten years haha.
screenjunkies Yeah this was pretty fun when Farley did this 20 years ago.
screenjunkies Dame Angela Lansbury. Now there is a smoking chick
screenjunkies Keanu Reeves. Id feign a handshake, go for the fist bump and then force a hug. The hug would be several seconds longer than it should be with one hand a bit too low. Our faces would inadvertently touch. Lastly, as he walked away, Id call to him, expectantly.
screenjunkies Quentin Tarantino or Michael Fassbender
screenjunkies Mark Wahlberg ,,, I would most likely talk about how awesome (The Rock) is!
screenjunkies Heres a great drinking game: Everytime Nick mentions The Rock, take a shot :P
screenjunkies I would like to meet either Vin Diesel for movies or Chester Bennington for a music interview.
screenjunkies someone needs to link this to the Rock. XD
screenjunkies huge crush on emma stone.
screenjunkies Incredible experiencia with The Rock, so awesome!
screenjunkies Poor Mark Walhberg! But happy to see you met your fav. actor.
screenjunkies Jim Carrey, Robert Downey Jr, Slash, Johnny Depp or Eminem :) Also Freddie Mercury and Michael Jackson, but its impossible to meet them because of a very obvious reason :D
screenjunkies Fat guy : OMFG The Rock!The Rock : Uhh k?Marky Mark : Fucking wrestling fans.
screenjunkies So this was one of the featured pages on youtube and just because of this video i wont watch another screen junkies video. ha u guys suck!
screenjunkies Mark Wahlberg is my idol

screenjunkies arnold schwarzenegger and chuck norris, hope i wrote arnolds last name correct.. i would absolutely pee myself.
screenjunkies arnold schwarzenegger and chuck norris, hope i wrote arnolds last name correct.. i would absolutely pee myself.
screenjunkies I wish that I could meet Sylvester Stallone. He has been my favorite superhero every since I started remembering things. It was thanks to him that in 1985, the world was exposed to the Motion Analysis Laboratory Technology. That is the computer system that they hooked up to Ivan Drago. In 1996, Shriners Hospitals in Greeneville, South Carolina, used this very same technology to fix my legs that were damaged by Cerebral Palsy. The console and its operator were Russian, and we talked about Ivan Drago. I would like to meet both Stallone and Lungdren, But my hero has always been Mister Balboa!
screenjunkies mark walburg just wanted to leave

screenjunkies HODOR hodor hodor hodor, hodor hodor? Hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor, hodor hodor! Hodor hodor hodor hodor...Hodor hodor,Hodor.
screenjunkies What is it about the good guys in T.V. shows being amongst the most excruciatingly boring, humourless, dull and dreary of all?...Watching (enduring) Rob Stark and John Snow is like succumbing to carbon monoxide poisoning  colourless, tasteless, odourless (well, 2 out of 3 aint bad) but anaesthetising to say the least. Then we have Sheriff Rick Grimes of The Walking Dead  boringno sense of humour whatsoever, followed by Dexter Morgan, the majority of superheroes  apart from perhaps Ironman, Hancock and that Green Lantern guy.
screenjunkies Arya Stark why because she is so amazing and a badass... And Daenarys because she has Dragons and huge huge army...
screenjunkies Game of thrones sucks ass. Its stupid, boring and way to much nudity witch I usually dont mind but here its like they put a naked chick in at every chance they get, its degrading. The plots are to confusing, there is barely any action. I dont know why people like this show . I want to know why.
screenjunkies I like all the characters, but I detest Bran. I wish he wasnt in the book at all.He is a kid.He even walk.He is learning magic. (I dont want disabled Harry Potter)Ever since he left Winterfell, his chapters became a travelogue. He has nothing to add to the story.
screenjunkies If you cant follow the simplified version (i.e. the TV series) ... then I wouldnt recommend the books. But, if you can then the books are awesome.
screenjunkies My faverite characters are: Jon, Tyrion, Arya and Daenerys
screenjunkies Favorites: Tywin, Tyrion , Robb Stark, SamAnnoying: Every character is quite interestingHated: Melisandre, Daenerys

screenjunkies i hated so much Sansa on the first season!!! but at the end shes not so bad :) Khal Drogo and Tyrion Lanister are my favorite caractor and John Snow is for me the hottest dude in the show! And of course Joffrey is a total bitch.
screenjunkies Theon GreyJoy is not a honorary stark, rather a captive hostage ward
screenjunkies My favourite guy is the faceless assassin :D :D :D That guy is soooo cool
screenjunkies Favorite character... If I had to chose... it would be Jon Snow... :D And the most annoying character... it supposed to be Joffrey or Theon... :D

screenjunkies Favorites: I havent ever watched the show lol.
screenjunkies Favourite is Joffrey and worst is Tyrion... Wtf... Something is wrong with me...
screenjunkies The show is all about the Starks getting fucked
screenjunkies I hate George R. R. Martin cause he killed almost anyone i liked.
screenjunkies My least Favorite character is Bron Stark, though he is probably going to a badass motherfucker later currently his scenes are boring and he is just riding around with level 25 pokemon Hodor.
screenjunkies Fav: Arya,Dany,JonAnnoying:Joffrey,Cercei,SansaHated: Joffrey,Joffrey,Joffrey and Joffrey (Thanks George RR Martin)

screenjunkies favourite character: Jaggen Haggar
screenjunkies how the hell can some of you like Cercei?? in some manner she is worse then idiot king Joffrey...and why is Daenerys annoying? please enlighten me? probably the only character i like and admire besides Tyrion, Arya, Jon and that assassin guy who helped Arya is Daenerys..watch the 1st episode of season 1 and the last and you will see the growth of her character...from being a sister to a guy who would let 40000 men rape her to get his throne to a leader and conqueror...

screenjunkies Fav Character: Bronn, Arya, Jon SnowCoolest: Tyrion, Jaqen, The HoundAnnoying: Mama Stark, Theon, CerseiHated: Joffrey, Red Sorcerer, Tywin
screenjunkies I love Ramsay cuz he fucked up Theon but they also make Theon look like a massive asshole in the show and he isnt nearly that bad in the books. I also love Arya and Dany in the books and Tyrion will always and forever be my favorite of all time.
screenjunkies Jaqen Hghar the best.end.
screenjunkies lol lost it at Tony Stark
screenjunkies Favorite characters: Tyrion, Ned Stark, Jon Snow, Arya Stark, faceless assassinHated: Joffrey, Theon Greyjoy
screenjunkies Joffrey needed to go for like 19 episodes ago hes the kind of vile character that astonishingly never seems to get whats coming to him. The Hound is the best one !!

Theres just something about his loveable blunderingness that pisses me off. Most hated: Joffery. Who else would it be?

screenjunkies sorry but your wrong about the irish were terrible drivers not terrible drinkers

screenjunkies Beam me up Skywalker!
screenjunkies Nerd theme holiday needs to be Durins Day. :3
screenjunkies Obama just wants to combine his favorite Scifi series, and create peace between them.
screenjunkies fandom day every fandom from otaku to whovein will be praised and given one thing from their respected choice from what ever series TV video games or otherwise
screenjunkies Give Obama a break Star Trek likely wasnt popular in Kenya when he was born. LolSiFi holiday how about July 8th Roswell crash day
screenjunkies this was GOLD until you claimed the British office was better. die.
screenjunkies You are the nerdiest thing I have ever seen how can you refuse to watch Doctor Who? I frequently sit through the extended versions of all three LotR movies in a row. I have seen the star wars moves so many times that i know the lines better then the actors an yet i cant stand star trek. How do you watch what is basically star wars, but not as cool, and reject Doctor Who, the best nerd show ever.
screenjunkies I would like a day where I could formally grieve for all my TV, book and movie character deaths that normal people scoff at. Suck it normal people! Today is Lock Myself in My Room and Eat My Feelings Day! p
screenjunkies super gross butt  you, hal
screenjunkies Starday as in patriotic stars and starwars, startreck, etc.
screenjunkies Pokppreciation Day pls
screenjunkies People that call themselves nerds are just people trying to be idiots in act like they know everything about comic books and everything to know about superheroes so if you are a nerd out there dont call your self one because that word is the word that is used by bullies Bullies call people nerdsBecause nowadays people that call themselves nerds wear shirts that say nerd on them they wear shirts that say geek on them I when I go and ask them questions about comic books they dont even know what a comic book isI love comic books and people act like they love comic books ruins everything they have never not once went to a super con or Comic Con so if you see somebody Thats says they are a nerd ask them a super hero question. People that call themselves nerds are not nerds Thank you and best regards
screenjunkies Trying to build an actual Death Star would be dumb, but making a space station in the shape of one would be hilarious.
screenjunkies This guy sounds like that Sicilian villain from The Princess Bride
screenjunkies ima tweet this to Obama. For the lols.
screenjunkies Whether you be a Star Wars or Star Trek fan, space day would be perfect for everyone.
screenjunkies And to think I wanted Obama for four years after this (Now I wish Romney won the election!!!!!)
screenjunkies This was really cute, I have to say.
screenjunkies It would be comic week my friend, not day, and I would have this huge party with a bunch of comic book movies being played on a large screen, and by playing a lot of card games. Yugioh, Magic, and who knows what else

screenjunkies An Urgent Message to Obama from All Nerds.
screenjunkies Like Gandalf told Charles Xavier, with great power comes great responsibility! :p

screenjunkies May the force ever be in you favor Mr Potter!  Gandlaf (The Chronicles of Narnia)
screenjunkies can you just SHUT UP!!!!!!!! HE DOESNT KNOW ANY BETTER YOU IDIOT!!!!!!! NOT EVERYONE IS A NERD!!!!!!!! 8(
screenjunkies Obama did try which is cool but he failed quite badly. If hes going to venture into using science fiction he should make sure he knows his stuff. He would actually be a lot cooler if he actually watched Star Trek and Star Wars. After his presidency that is. Im sure he has no time to do that as president and spend time with his family. Unless his familys watching that kind of Sci Fi.
screenjunkies this was amazing, i laughed all the way through!
screenjunkies Halo day n us celebrate by tbags on ur face
screenjunkies he forgot the line his nerd writers wrote for him
screenjunkies Beam Me Up Skywalker! Now what?
screenjunkies The day reach fell and everone would dress up
screenjunkies IT TIME FOR NEEDCLEAR WAR !!!!
screenjunkies Why is everyone saying Beam me up, Skywalker. ITS SKYPOTTER GODAMMIT.
screenjunkies Worf blew up the death star, hahaha.
screenjunkies a jedi mind meld actually does exist from the star wars expanded universe.
screenjunkies Well there are many Doctor Who fans that I know who have bashed Star Trek and never seen it, So cut him some slack.
screenjunkies Fanfic doesnt count bro.
screenjunkies If you read the book you should know THAT THE MOVIES CAME FIRST!!!
screenjunkies you do not belong there are ones before you
screenjunkies The best part is that even if it was an error, the Jedi Mind Meld is a real thing.
screenjunkies It tasted like a super gross butt because Obama is a super gross butthead. Wow, havent said butthead in ages...xD
screenjunkies Thats exactly how he has this country on a mind melt Jedi trick for kids
screenjunkies Haha I cant argue with that. However, Google Force meld and click on the Wookieepedia link. The page lists 24 books that either include or reference a jedi mind meld. Theyre not the Thrawn series, but at least they say Star Wars on the cover.
screenjunkies what, that he has the original DVD release box set that i also have but is now useless cause i obviously got the blueray set? i mean come on it, LotR, gotta have that shit in blueray.. but ya, is that all yer referencing? i dont get why this is a top comment, lol..
screenjunkies May I ask, which, of the thousands of Star Wars Books would you be referring to? If its anything outside of the Thrawn series it doesnt count because fuck you.
screenjunkies The British Office is definitely better! Its nice to see someone else think so too.
screenjunkies yah, but there are fans of each who do not like the other and would be offended that they are brought up together like that.
screenjunkies Lets be honest, the only holiday that would be worth it is either national SupesBatsWonder woman day(honoring a day they were born or died) or Changing Fathers day to IAmYourFather Day, causing all dead beat dads to reconcile with their sons and daughters they had abandoned or else they be electrocuted, and thrown off a bridge.
screenjunkies So he made a mistake it happens
screenjunkies The British The Office is indeed better the the US The Office.
screenjunkies The question: I like to call it comicon.
screenjunkies 1.watch all my favourite 2.watch all the screen junkies videos 3.realise all my favourite films suck 4.then watch them again anyway
screenjunkies Well, we already have a blow sh!t up day (74). So... maybe we should have Picard Day and celebrate by giving all the little kids lasers and cell phones.
screenjunkies Moogle day, forcing all my friends to say kupo at the end of everything, and somehow even though it will be an american holiday, force the British to do this...as only then it would apply to my friends kupo!
screenjunkies I guess he made up for it with the DFTBA thing
screenjunkies I love how in 3:24 its exactly how i felt when it was all a vision
screenjunkies what is the name of the stare music?!!
screenjunkies I want more twilight movies just for more of this
screenjunkies Girls are actually stating to name their daughters renesmee.... Fuck... Its all over the internet... renesmee sounds like a white trash house cleaner name... Fuck poor kids
screenjunkies WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL.
screenjunkies 2:26 Best stare ever XD
screenjunkies I was the only girl in my whole middle school to despise this when it first came out
screenjunkies If a vampire bites an unattractive person, do the automatically become attractive?
screenjunkies Say I just wanted to piss you of before I kill you
screenjunkies Yannow, it seriously makes me want to hit myself with a bat knowing that lots of girls my age actually LIKE THIS.
screenjunkies hahahhahaha i really love twilight Im like the biggest fan of twilight, but this is just so funny i cant stop laughing! :D
screenjunkies this is literally the best thing ever!
screenjunkies Srsly that staring thing cracks me up everytime. But really that Skeletor thing sold me.
screenjunkies I love how the Bellas father is totally oblivious to everything going on. Isnt she still a teenager? He must be the least engaged parent of all time.
screenjunkies I cracked up at SKELETOR! :D
screenjunkies PLS PLS PLS Say: Bewbs...Bewbs...Bewbs. Oh yeah thats the one!
screenjunkies I cant believe i watched all those movies :x
screenjunkies how can u fuck without blood circulation ?????
screenjunkies Dont be hatin on the wolves D: They were this whole series saving grace.
screenjunkies HAHAHAHA this is the best one
screenjunkies Thats it I died at and the MOST...STAREs...EVER ...AHAHAAHAHAHAVampires dont Sparkle in the sun these vampires are fairies :P
screenjunkies whats the stare music?
screenjunkies I fucking lost it when he said Skeletor! XD
screenjunkies the climax was all a dream what a rip off lol.
screenjunkies Go home, stares... Youre drunk.
screenjunkies If you follow the legal system, a man of 100 years old cant have sex with a teenager of 17, that is very strict, even if the teenager is a few month of being 18, if you have sex, you go to jail, period. And you are right, they are shitty characters, and their whole relationship in based in the Mormon dogma, and conservatives believes, like no sex before marriage, and not abortion.
screenjunkies Check out my twilight vampire facts at my channel
screenjunkies And I thought the werewolves were bad..... Could they not find a real baby to use for the scenes?
screenjunkies Im laughing so hard right now, whoever made this is a genius
screenjunkies lmao lmao Im crying right now!!!! dude got my lungs starting to hurt lol seriously :) lol starring shovelface, skeletor and snow dogs :) lol this whole thing is super funny, and when he talks about five car commercials and chess playing but hes honest :)
screenjunkies say its peanut butter jelly time
screenjunkies THANK GOD ITS OVER!!! srsly, shovel face is the shittiest actor ever.
screenjunkies THE STAIRS THE BEST PART
screenjunkies He was also pretty good in Water For Elephants.
screenjunkies lmao!! to cover up for the shows creepy pedophilia
screenjunkies Holy shit. I just realized that the evil vampire of the Vatican is Masters from Masters of Sex...I feel like crying now.sniffle I love Masters.
screenjunkies You should make a mouthbreather and shovelface tshirt
screenjunkies say  Even though u r not a unicorn, you eat pickles with coffee.
screenjunkies He probably feels like crying too.
screenjunkies Seriously this movie is beyond stupid, how come anyone enjoy this?!!
screenjunkies Ghost can kick Jacobs ass
screenjunkies Yikes, that makes for awkward breastfeeding.
screenjunkies only epic thing about these movies is at 2:29 where bellas daugther is sitting on jacob werewolf form
screenjunkies I watched all the honest trailers of twilight saga! Say Im Daves new best friend
screenjunkies Twilight is so fucking dumb.
screenjunkies Its so AWESOME how hes called Shovelface the whole time while she has the honored of being named:VanillaFishFaceDeadEyes Justsmelledpoopfacemouthbreather Skeletor
screenjunkies I keep laughing at shovelface and mouthbreather. :p
screenjunkies Do Grave Encounters 1 and 2 !!!
screenjunkies Theres a movie patrick stewart did called safe house.... I think it would put this entire saga to shame. I consider it the worst film ever made. I am amazed it didnt kill patricks career.
screenjunkies Taylor Swift so amazing hahaha
screenjunkies And Kristen Stewart . . . And her inability to use toothpaste Hahaha cant stop laughing
screenjunkies Say I have the one Dyldo to rule them all.
screenjunkies This is amazing. It gives me so much humility for liking these movies. I still dont feel any different...but this is hilarious.
screenjunkies Soooooo intense !!!!! those stares douhhhh
screenjunkies Thank heavens this franchise is over
screenjunkies 3.30 hahahaahah just made me die ahahaah lmao
screenjunkies Oh god! The staring hahahaha I cant stop laughing!!!
screenjunkies Dude am I the only one who thinks that Kristen is hotter as a vampire
screenjunkies I saw this movie yeaterday, the part 2 and I cannot understand why this movies were  are so popular. I really dont get it : anand yes, during the movie I was thinking Shovelface... Shovelface....
screenjunkies say SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY
screenjunkies i rather have my head rip off   gold
screenjunkies i need to see the league of extraordinary gentlemen.... expected to be awesome
screenjunkies This movie is so NASTY, that it made look its parody Vampires Suck like a master piece of art, at least the cast was way better looking and more realistic that this Huge piece of shit.
screenjunkies I cringed at the amount of tooth paste that missed her toothbrush.
screenjunkies Does anyone know the music used from 2:11 ish, the background music of the stares
screenjunkies say who da fuk is this asshole
screenjunkies Pretty much what twilight is ...... a bunch of crap
screenjunkies Im the same way! Shovelface and mouth breather... I burst out laughing every time I hear it. Awesome.
screenjunkies Ron Burgundy.... wahahahahaha
screenjunkies There is only 1 big problem of the Twilight saga finishing... we wont get any more of these honest trailers
screenjunkies mouth breather and shovel face
screenjunkies TAYLOR SWIFT! ROFL! XD
screenjunkies Say Little Baby Buggy Bumpers please!!!!!
screenjunkies Say Thats how the ball bounces G. Please!
screenjunkies Twilight is a schizophrenics wet dream  i think the all the films are the fathers delusion since hes probably huffing paint thinner. (I have never seen a twilight film but going by Honest trailers it seems im right)
screenjunkies and the inability to use toothpaste. hahah holy crap
screenjunkies OMG OMG OMG OMG, WOW, such GREAT ACTING. Such WELL THOUGHT OUT STARES. SO MUCH EMOTIONS I CAN TASTE IT. So fucking perfectly scripted and amazing I just wanna put a bullet in my head. Cause, ya know, its JUST THAT GOOD. SO GOOD I CANT EVEN HANDLE IT. BELLA SWAN IS THE MOST WELL THOUGHT OUT CHARACTER EVER CONCEIVED. Seriously. She has no personality of her own so her beautiful young fans can put themselves in her bland shoes satchels herself on SO LOVINGLY to any dude that returns her stares, is willing to date a 109 year old pedophile stalker BECAUSE SHES JUST SO LOVING, and is willing to carry a vampire demon spawn baby to full term.... BECAUSE LOVE. WHAT A DECENT HUMAN BEING. I HOPE I HAVE A DAUGHTER JUST LIKE HER.
screenjunkies Most of the time they just dont speak and stare awkward
screenjunkies With all this staring Im surprised no one caught on fire.
screenjunkies Her mouth is always fucking open :))))))))) WITH HER TWO BUCK TEETH.
screenjunkies you forgot the part in breaking dawn part two when alice was walking across the feild she shared at everyone while doing this that bust be at least another whole minute of sharing
screenjunkies Awww i wanted to hear the stare music... sigh Oh well
screenjunkies NEW GAMEreply with how long you could watch with out skipping forward. be honest.
screenjunkies Oh my god her face is the same is every goddam scene
screenjunkies Well, thats 26 minutes of my life that ill never get back...
screenjunkies OK I love the channel but I hope I never become bored enough to sit though this.Me bounce now.
screenjunkies 26mins of stares! No no no no humanity has not come to this
screenjunkies I never actually noticed how much they all stare at each other until now
screenjunkies TWENTY SIX FREAKING MINUTES?!?! XD
screenjunkies No one blinks in this movie!! OO LOL!! XD
screenjunkies I have obviously died and been sent to hell to endure this
screenjunkies Still a better love story than... oh wait.
screenjunkies 3 minutes and 3 seconds of stares are now logged for me. My brain hurts just trying to process all of them....
screenjunkies I LOVE the stares so much!!!But I couldnt watch the whole thing. I just couldnt do it...I made it to 3:30...
screenjunkies Thousands of preteens and lonely mothers wasted 26 minutes of their lives watching people stare at each other.
screenjunkies I went crazy after the first min. :(
screenjunkies Could someone just tell me the name of stares song ?
screenjunkies I came here from Breaking Dawns Honest Trailer expecting a 6 minute long video of stares since theres an overabundance of staring in this franchise, but, wow. Did the actors hate these movies so much that they went out of their way to avoid acting in them? cause thats the vibe Im getting.
screenjunkies I did the math. Total run time of all 5 movies is 608 minutes. 24m 37s is 4 of the saga.
screenjunkies This made me feel awkward.
screenjunkies I couldnt stop laughing
screenjunkies I cant believe I watched that whole thing. I need to reevaluate the life decisions that have led me to this point.
screenjunkies i made it two minute two
screenjunkies wow, nearly 30 mins of just stares!!! why do some people like these movies?
screenjunkies I watched 10 seconds before skipping to the end and checking the stare total. Waaaaaaaaay too much staring
screenjunkies 0:13 onwards what music is that?
screenjunkies Omg I only made it 2.30 minutes in...
screenjunkies Are really all the movie makers afraid to tell her to close her mouth or does she have a problem
screenjunkies Does she litraly have no facial muscles.
screenjunkies I think I just watched the whole movie. I havent seen the movie but now I know whats going on...through painfully awkward stares.
screenjunkies Could this movie be any greener?
screenjunkies Stupid video waste of time !
screenjunkies Its funny how all the stare scenes mashed together is better then the actual movie.
screenjunkies It could almost be a silent movie
screenjunkies We cant think of anything for this scene, just stare for five minutes
screenjunkies Made it to 04:43. I feel like a champ. A disgusting champ.
screenjunkies WTF is wrong with her hand at 1:27?
screenjunkies Whats the song used in the title card and in the staring scenes in honest trailers?
screenjunkies Did I just waste half an hour of my life watching the stares of Twilight? Damit, the realization make me feel how sad my life is!!
screenjunkies wait a second, so a half hour of these terrible movies are stares?! WHAT THE FCK!!
screenjunkies OK I get a brownie badge for watching the whole thing.
screenjunkies 3 minutes was enough for me...
screenjunkies seriously, how the fuck did these movies ever get made? i even had to invent a new word to describe their utter shitness as no existing word would do. that word is......dildge
screenjunkies Omg you guys actually suffered through all these movies to make this vid! Thats what i call a sacrifice for the audience!
screenjunkies Aww! Love this overview of The Twilight Saga in 26:13! Thank you for doing this!!!
screenjunkies And scene! Totally nailed it
screenjunkies I only liked it because it was funny to watch! Like if you watched the entire thing, but suffered through it all!
screenjunkies To quote the Honest Trailer of Paranormal Activity,  Stairs, stairs, stairs...
screenjunkies This is hilarious! I never realized how much of each movie was just stares. XD Lol!
screenjunkies There is a special corner booth in heaven for the people who had to edit these movies into this stareathon. I only made it 2:35 into it. Sorry, but my commitment level is not intense enough to subject myself to Twilight without the mockable dialogue, etc.
screenjunkies I got past the first movie onto the seocond . why am I doing this im so not going to be able to watch much longer :P lasted 02:15
screenjunkies I feel terribly sorry for the person who had to edit this.
screenjunkies I cant believe I made it through the whole 26 minutes  there is must be something wrong with me haha :P
screenjunkies 1:13 for me XD couldnt take it any longer :DD
screenjunkies I think that is actually good up to 6:36 remove the parts that dont have romance and the sparkle scene, and you have a sweet little boymeetsgirl, boydumpsgirl film. (No vampires, no weird noises, no plot holes, no love triangles.)
screenjunkies This is the longest time I have ever stared at people staring at each other...
screenjunkies They missed a golden chance at comedy, I know I would have laughed if Edward closed Bellas mouth for her. He would have even gotten some respect for it.
screenjunkies Twilight has a whole minute of stares in each 22,18 minutes of movie. If you cut them off, you can go to the bathroom every 21 minutes. It may be handy for, you know, mental diarrhea.
screenjunkies hahaha it looks like some kind of modernartexperimentalmovie
screenjunkies I gave up at the 2 minute mark......
screenjunkies Worst movie ever!! Why do they keep making sequels?! It sucks. Only idiots with nothing to do pay to see a film as horrid as that I guess maybe thats why they continue making them. Gosh, people spend your money on something more productive, like feeding a hobo or something.
screenjunkies I just think its funny that Bellas grampa is Miles Matheson (Revolution) with a mustachio..
screenjunkies this video made me so uncomfortable with the awkward silences.
screenjunkies How much can a humans sanity take??
screenjunkies it took me a while to finish the video it ended with me laughing all over the floor with how bad these movies were made yet i still sat my ass and watched every single one of them
screenjunkies ...why do her stares look like shes having poorly concealed orgasms...?
screenjunkies This baby is monstruously fake. 2014, hello? Cute effect total fail...
screenjunkies Lasted a minute and a half with all those creepy stares. My respect to anybody being a masochist enough to last 26 minutes of this cinematic torture.
screenjunkies wut? a drinking game that requires you drink whenever the main character appears? dude you just want to drink the hell out, dontcha?
screenjunkies Purge, seriously? Like... Seriously??
screenjunkies Did you know that for three hours, Kristen Stewart kept her mouth open during the entire series?
screenjunkies your picture is just perfect
screenjunkies huffff ! kenapa di Indonesia banyak sekali aturan yg g msuk akal, pdahal film ini bgus bgt  banyak yg suka.
screenjunkies I got up to 2.35 mins of staring! Time Ill never get back...
screenjunkies FUCK YOU PURGE WHY YOU DIS 2 US!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies this is amazing! haha
screenjunkies I love how you wave goodbye
screenjunkies I want Matt Damon to host
screenjunkies that was barbara STREISAND
screenjunkies the thing w adele was a little too mean
screenjunkies FYI: youd better not criticize Travoltas pronounciation of les mis, since he rolls the r in a way that sounds better than you... (And I AM french, so I know what Im talking about ) )
screenjunkies Itd be awesome if Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel hosted that shit
screenjunkies I want the ghost of Paul Walker to host.  Low, so low.
screenjunkies Resorting to making jokes about Adeles weight and accent, yeah not Screenjunkies at its best here...
screenjunkies Dream Oscar host???definitely Hal Rudnick..
screenjunkies Oh my God, Rudnick !! That suit has got to go. Were you a Salvation Army Store model in a previous life ?
screenjunkies Funny that Hal said We want more Ben Affleck, considering the controversy over Batfleck... just interesting.
screenjunkies NPH should just host everything.
screenjunkies Hal Rudnick should host the Oscars
screenjunkies Most Awkward award should have gone to Melissa Mcarthy and Paul Dudds jokes. God that sucked.
screenjunkies Barbra Walters? Please tell me I missed a joke there...since thats obviously Barbra Steisand...
screenjunkies My dream Oscar host is Robin Williams, although he was there partially in the 80s..
screenjunkies Liking those action figures of Mulder and Scully you have there :)
screenjunkies Mel Gibson should host the Oscars...
screenjunkies did anyone notice how uncomfortable this episode was? i thought hal wanted to leave from the beginning especially if you notice he started to say something before the overlord voice finished introducing the showing... maybe just me but it felt very forced almost as if they felt obligated to do this episode. I still loved it just felt kind of weird.
screenjunkies My dream host would be Robert Downey jr as Kirk Lazarus from tropic thunder!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies The rock and the expendable
screenjunkies Hal would be great. I watch the Oscars anyway but it would be very entertaining if he hosted.
screenjunkies YOU SHOULD HOST!!!!!That would be an amazing show... :)
screenjunkies Ted was joking?? :D :D :D
screenjunkies Barbara Streisand, not Walters.
screenjunkies More Affleck? One word: Batman
screenjunkies This is the most creative thing Ive see by you. Pure genius! Btw, Adele also thanked Mr Bean, Roald Dahl, FrenchSaunders and the congestion Charge. It was a pretentious speech (i still love Adele, Shallow Hal)
screenjunkies So John Travolta has mispronounced something for two straight oscars.
screenjunkies Andy Serkis as Golum and Caesar and whoever else.
screenjunkies Barbara Walters? Try again lol.
screenjunkies 3:08How dare you sir. NO!!!... No... :P
screenjunkies Not Chris tucker or Chris rock, definitely not. Trey Parker or Matt Stone.
screenjunkies Why werent Paul Rudd  Melissa McCarthy up for Most Awkward Award while presenting Best Animated Film?
screenjunkies Adele is famous, but why isnt Susan Boyle as famous as her? She can sing better.
screenjunkies Im surprised no one mentioned the boob song
screenjunkies Apart from you, I would like Jim Carrey to host the shows. Im just saying, to ME, his hilarious!
screenjunkies When did the screen junkies become TMZ?
screenjunkies Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman
screenjunkies I just think that he is not simply hilarious at all. He and his family guy is boring as hell.
screenjunkies Non, il na pas mon ami. :P
screenjunkies We want Affleck! More Affleck! YOU MADE BATFLECK HAPPEN!
screenjunkies Wolverine sings?! :p Why oh why did you not mention Charlize Theron and Naomi Watts look when McFarlane was singing We saw your boobs?!?!?! Priceless looks! I believe that Robert Donwey Jr with Emma Stone... maybe?
screenjunkies Comedy. Look it up in the dictionary Then afterwards know that anything that falls under the definition of comedy (this video) is not meant to be taken seriously.
screenjunkies Im waiting for the time when he says: Yeah, I look like Peewee Herman.
screenjunkies Thats Barbara Streisand, not Barbara Walters. There is a difference.
screenjunkies I know you think you are funny but you actually are not. Accepted it and stop doing these kind of video.
screenjunkies I hate Seth macfarlane
screenjunkies Shit, never mind. I just heard him put the s at the end. Sorry.
screenjunkies Oh fuck man, that antiSemitic Ted joke was hilarious. :p Also, what do you mean awkward pronunciation of Les Miserables? Thats how you pronounce it. Awkward for Americans maybe.
screenjunkies Chuck Norris as the next host!!
screenjunkies Fuck you ...live with it !
screenjunkies Thania is right.why bother complaining about alleged anti semitism yet see no problem doing a mockery out of adeles weight.
screenjunkies I want Steve Guttenberg to host the Oscars.
screenjunkies Bill hader, Joseph Gordon levitt, or
screenjunkies You look just like PeeWee Herman!!!
screenjunkies SACHA BARON COHEN!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies it would be great if Robert Downey Jr, hosted the Oscars
screenjunkies The best person to host the Oscars is ups Russia
screenjunkies Is there a reason u called Barbara Streisand Barbara Walters??
screenjunkies Indeed, Travolta got it all wrong. I cant believe 49 people upvoted someone who clearly has no idea about what hes talking about..oh wait, this is the internet.
screenjunkies George carlins dead body
screenjunkies cicero from skyrim should host the oscars because....just because
screenjunkies Oh I see. (The more you know)
screenjunkies I WANT THE ACTION FIGURES IN THE BACKGROUND O.O
screenjunkies Ellen DeGeneres is actually hosting the 2014 Oscars :D Im so excited!!!
screenjunkies Barbra Streisand not Walters
screenjunkies A mix between Hitler and the gay villain from skyfall
screenjunkies It would be so awesome if Ellen DeGeneres hosted the Oscars again, shes awesome!
screenjunkies THE LAST AIRBENDER YES
screenjunkies Id want ezio from assassins creed to host the oscars
screenjunkies Hollywood doesnt give a shit. Only thing that matters is getting u to pay for a ticket because they can always get you to see the next movie.The hopeadope strategy, lol.
screenjunkies XMen: Days of Future Past? more like Wolverine  the Xmen: the live action film.
screenjunkies it would be nice to see cyclops and jean resurrected some how, anyway i think the movie may have already screwed up because of the fact ONCE AGAIN the story revolves around wolverine
screenjunkies First class is the best Xmen by far
screenjunkies I want to see all of the XMen, SpiderMan, The Avengers, Deadpool, and I guess The Fantastic Four (the only Marvel groups that Im fully aware of) together for like 2 or 3 movies. But replace everyone in The Fantastic Four except for The Thing because I didnt like the actors they had in the original two movies... that and The Human Torch also being Captain America would be difficult in some scenes
screenjunkies Were ANY of the XMens good???
screenjunkies Gambit fact, True story. They messed up a great xmen character. WolverineOrigins
screenjunkies I kinda agree with Alison. Make a better Deadpool! Give him his costume, his guns, katanas and his sense of humor! I know it could be potentially weird seeing as he would be entirely different from the other one but since he has a tendency to break the 4th wall he could just be like: Well, they completely fucked me up in Xmen Origins Wolverine so they brought me back! New and improved! Happy now nerds?
screenjunkies half of me wants these movies to do well because it sucks when you see characters and stories that you love get butchered. The other half wants 20th century fox and sony to have a series of busts so that... well, you know. I just want everyone in the same universe.
screenjunkies Justice league, avengers, x men , Star Wars, spider man , dead pool, death stroke, black Adam, silver surfer and Loki team up together to fight galactus.
screenjunkies Batman and howard the duck. Ben Affleck would play howard the duck.
screenjunkies Hulk...Wolverine...Spiderman....and The Tick...lmao jk...ummm....Dr. Strange or Green Arrow (the one from the tv show)
screenjunkies Id like to see Batman and Darkwing Duck battle together.
screenjunkies Holy crap!! Deadpool, Spiderman, Daredevil, and Wolverine. I call it!
screenjunkies Come on! I like the XMen Origins Wolverine
screenjunkies I understand what she means about Deadpools blades being longer than his forearms, but technically, Wolverine shouldnt be able to bend his wrists with how long his claws are, and we let that slide...
screenjunkies My favorite XMEN character is Jean GreyThe Phoenix. The movie did a terrible job on her storyline DreamKiller
screenjunkies Gandalf the Grey,And Gandalf the White,And Monty Python and the Holy Grails Black Knight,And Benito Mussolini,And the Blue Meanie,And Cowboy Curtis,And Jambi the Genie,Robocop,The Terminator,Captain Kirk,And Darth Vader,Lo Pan,Superman,Every single Power Ranger,Bill S. Preston,And Theodore Logan,Spock,The Rock,Doc Ock,And Hulk Hogan.
screenjunkies I WANT EVERYONE TOGETHER!!!!!!
screenjunkies Fuck Deadpool having too long katanas...give that motherfucker a mouth!!!! My favorite part about Deadpool was his flippant attitude about EVERYTHING! Yes, I see the dichotomy between his mouthy human self and this silent mutated one but I want Deadpool to have real katanas, a shit ton of guns and make stupid over the top one liners because thats the Deadpool I know and love.
screenjunkies Wolverine and the Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D.
screenjunkies I agree, too many movies are based on Wolverine... we need a new set of characters. And fix Deadpool, because I LOVE Deadpool, and he looks worse then the Green Lanterns Movie SGI Suit
screenjunkies My ultimate team would be Spiderman, Wolverine, Deadpool, and CM Punk.
screenjunkies NO, it will not suck! This is too good a cast and director to suck. it WILL redeem the last couple crappers. (X3 and Origins). Little known fact here  First Class started as Xmen Origins: Magneto, however after several drafts it turned into First Class. But it never lost the focus on Magneto, he was the main character throughout the entire film. I believe this is why it was so successful. People LOVE Magneto and to see him in his prime like a lot of the cartoons and comics do, it just hit all the right spots.
screenjunkies deathstroke and batman
screenjunkies I want to see spiderman and the avengers fight the colecter and thanos
screenjunkies superman batman the hulk (bruce banner) wolverine and ant man
screenjunkies How about Hulk, Superman, and Thor.
screenjunkies Heres the thing that bothers me, Wolverine is the lead and main character in this movie. If you know the original comic series of Days of Future Past, you would know that Kitty Pryde aka Shadowcat is the the focus of a majority of the story. Its kind of sexist that she is taking the backseat to Wolverine.
screenjunkies i agree with Alison .. I LOVE GAMBIT
screenjunkies If Deadpool looked like Deadpool that would be nice
screenjunkies I want to see all marvel and dc heroes to team up and fight all their enemies together. That would be AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies they ruined dead pool i hope if they put dead pool in the movie it wont be that mouth less abomination they took away his mouth his nick name is the merc with a mouth
screenjunkies i agree with Allyson but, calm down woman..
screenjunkies THAT WAS DEADPOOL?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! D8 D8 D8 D8
screenjunkies OMG I want to see the XForce!!! Archangel, Deadpool, Deathlok, Fantomex, Nightcrawler, Psylocke, and Wolverine!!!!! If they make a movie with them, and add the whole Hope story and Cable and The Avengers... just wow.
screenjunkies Spiderman and Deadpool.
screenjunkies Marc was the only one that answer some good questions the rest suck. I want to see Apocalypse and Cable lead on to what the Avengers marvel franchise is doing.
screenjunkies YES! all Marvel is crap since mickey mouse is the boss!!!
screenjunkies Avengers vs XMen. That was a great story and it could be its own trilogy. Imagine all the fight scenes and how the character from all the movies would interact.
screenjunkies i love that via a goofball comedybased comic book, dipshit bros know what fourth wall means.Stealth learning motherfuckers.
screenjunkies The Marvel street level heroes. Spidey, Daredevil, Iron Fist, Luke Cage, Moon Knight?Black Cat?
screenjunkies Yes, the way they used deadpool in the wolverine origins pissed me off, like, he needed his mouth and please give him his costume and his swords and some sense of humor! goddamnit marvel
screenjunkies Marvel vs Capcom  The Movie
screenjunkies Thor, the Hulk, Spiderman, Loki, Maximum Ride and the rest of the Avengers. Just because.
screenjunkies Id like to see all the avengers  xmen caught inside the matrix and trying to beat Neo wahaahaha, Imagine the look on their faces when neo bends wolverines blades like a spoon!
screenjunkies Have batman team up with the fantastic 4 and xmen with guest apperances from iron man and thor while going against loki the winter soldier and Magneto to try to take all the elemets from the sun to blow up our galaxy
screenjunkies so are you going to do a Godzilla Trailer?
screenjunkies I think it will be good
screenjunkies Deadpool, Iceman, Mr. Marvel, and Ghost Rider
screenjunkies Star Wars and Star Trek meet that would blow my mind
screenjunkies I want some Carnage. Thats all I ever wanted
screenjunkies if a Star Destroyer flies in at the end of Avengers 2, i will be cracking up :
screenjunkies I really think if the director really wants to make ANY of these movies to work he simply needs to not only watch the entire cartoon series of the Xmen but become passionate about them but also read the comics. They need Bishop and Cable to bring the professor back get Gene under control so they can use the Pheonixs powers, bring in Gambit, Collosses (the older version) Ice Man (older) Wolverine Cyclopes (with there comic suits) Beast and Professor X.
screenjunkies Best teamup to emphasize would be a StormBlack Panther Movie. Or maybe Magik and Nightcrawler for awesome teleportation fights.
screenjunkies Kitty pryde nightcrawler and invisible woman would make an ultimate stealthy team
screenjunkies I was just talking about the katana thing this afternoon!what a coincidence!
screenjunkies Whoa, back up, Fantastic Four reboot?
screenjunkies I wanna see Space Ghost and Bird Man terminate Dick Dastardly
screenjunkies The Host for this vid is Sucks...
screenjunkies Deadpool, Cable, Wolverine with the Punisher and Nick Fury.
screenjunkies Iron man and batman LOL batman would be all serious and tony stark would be like HELL YEAHHH!
screenjunkies The whole XMen movie franchise is screwed up. All of the stories are cobbled together mish mashes of characters that have been thrown together for the cool factor. I grew up reading XMen comics, and every movie has been disappointing to me. So, Yeah! Days of Future Past will suck.
screenjunkies They said it doesnt take place in the same universe as avenger but scarlet witch and quick silver are cast in both Xmen days of future past and Avengers 2 age of untron so it should be the same universe
screenjunkies Yes, Days of Future Past will suck as much as, or more than, the first three abominations of XMen 13. With those movies the studio opened its ass and dropped a giant duke all over every character in the comics. Just because they stole the name of one of the most beloved Uncanny XMen story arcs does not mean it will be anything but garbage, no matter how anyone tries to convince themselves otherwise.
screenjunkies I would love them to introduce deadpool probably and attempt to make the x force team with phantom x also I would love them to either do hulk vs wolverine as I think that would be Awsome or bring beta ray bill into the thor movies
screenjunkies Alison!!! Welcome back! Miss you from g4!!!! Ah the good ol days.
screenjunkies what Bryan Singer needs to fix is how the two timelines, that of First Class and the original trilogy, dont mesh at all. If you watch the original trilogy, there is absolutely NO sense that Mystique and Xavier spent the first 20 something sears of their lives basically as brother and sister, she poisons Ceribro (ignore the spelling) for gods sake!!! and thats just one example. They need to establish some kind of split in the continuity and create some kind of alternateuniverse type situation with the time travel aspect of DOFP.
screenjunkies I agree, i was very upset with the misconduct of Dark Phoenix as just Code Name or alter ego than the Cosmic Force it is.
screenjunkies Id have to go with Captain America, Tony Stark, and Wolverine. Plus begin to work Pepper Pots into her roll as Rescue!
screenjunkies Question: How does Magneto bend Wolverines adamantium claws if adamantium doesnt bend? Is it because Magneto is too strong or because adamantium CAN be bent if the force is strong enough?
screenjunkies 6:10 And yet, nothing on Lady Deathstrike and her adamantium nails in X2?
screenjunkies I just want to see Wolverine fight the Hunk to be honest!
screenjunkies I call BS on this whole video
screenjunkies Best team up would be spiderman and deadpool
screenjunkies They are gonna fuck this up.
screenjunkies i would love to see hulk join spiderman. peter trying to hide hulk from his aunt is to funny.
screenjunkies Hollywood knows it has to make superheroes movies good then how do you explain the clusterfuck last part of The Wolverine. Started great, middle is OK. Then boom everything went to crap.
screenjunkies 1:12  He asked how many times youve been in love, not how many times youve picked up a guy in a bar and had a one night stand. She doesnt even know what Back to the Future is. I dont care how hot you are, thats inexcusable.
screenjunkies okay okay okay....where are the REAL girls from craigslist. the fat ugly and insane ones?
screenjunkies I refuse to date a girl until shes seen Back to the Future at least once.
screenjunkies hulk and black widow, and it would go like this, HULK SMASH!!!!
screenjunkies Hals reaction to the girl thinking Leia was played by Natalie Portman was priceless.
screenjunkies Are these girls actors?...
screenjunkies And back to the future
screenjunkies A younger Neo (Keanu Reeves) from the Matrix, and Bella (Kirsten Stewart) from Twilight, so they could stare at each other devoid of emotion for hours.
screenjunkies I hate romantic movies and so do all other men thats why guys will try to fell up their dates while their watching a romantic movie You first think why dont they just screw already ... wait a minute thats why I agreed to come here! arm over the shoulder and on to the tit or other sexy parts of the body really anything you can touch without getting thrown out of the movie theater
screenjunkies 1.Dirty Dancing2.Say Anything...3.Twilight4.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind5.The Terminator6.Star Wars7.Back to the Future
screenjunkies I love how the Terminator question just blew her fucking mind. Only a man like Cameron could sell that idea to a studio and get a few million dollars for it.
screenjunkies Id like to see Sarah Connor and Shovelface on a date. Shed stake him inside of 15 minutes.
screenjunkies So... Hal. Did you get lucky?IN YOUR EYES

screenjunkies Sterling archer and leela from futurama it would be so funny cuz archer would just like be nonstop making fun of her eye and then theyd start fighting and then knowing archer have sex
screenjunkies that youre great on oral sex...you are the man, man :p
screenjunkies To quote cracked: spidermam, and the mother from iron giant (she deserves a nice guy)
screenjunkies Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Edward Cullen, before Edward met Bella. Buffy would stake him, save the day and prevent a horrible, dystopian future from ever happening.
screenjunkies I am a girl and understood every reference immediately, im probably not hot enough to have made it into the video though...
screenjunkies I have never been out on a date on valentines day, and after watching this video i will make sure i will never do it.
screenjunkies Testing out how classic movie romance plotlines would work in the real world...
screenjunkies I recognized terminator and Star Wars
screenjunkies Ellen Ripley and Captain America
screenjunkies Needless to say, none of these women are keepers. These arent even obscure references or anything.

screenjunkies Natalie Portman in Empire Strikes Back!?
screenjunkies That was in fact the moment when I stopped the vid, cause I lost all interest in these girls.
screenjunkies whats up with Brenna and the Amish haystack hairdo?
screenjunkies I love how they dont get the references lol
screenjunkies Hum.. Ok, but first, lets clarify things.. Does porn count as movies and does one right hand count as getting laid?
screenjunkies Is Brenna trying to look like a hen?
screenjunkies Are you sure that Ali isnt just Mila Kunis changing her name for the video to lead you to believe shes a real person with a real opinion and not just a real actress with a real opinion?
screenjunkies That PeeWee Herman doll looks uncannily like you.
screenjunkies Yay for Eternal Sunshine reference!
screenjunkies Uhhh, I was born in 89 and all I know about Gabriel is hes a singer. Obviously I got nearly every other reference.
screenjunkies They dont get any of the references thus far ive got them all!

screenjunkies What if you asked questions too smart girls wth boobies not flat chested pretty faced dumb girls ??? YOU ARE KILLING ME WTH STEREOTYPES
screenjunkies dont forget star wars a new hope for the blowing up the death star reference
screenjunkies Ive just realised that you can literally justify any situation with the line well it doesnt matter because Im Patrick Swayze.
screenjunkies 3:40 this bitch needs to not live anymore! Like go away, no oxygen to the lungs.
screenjunkies How can you not know who Peter Gabriel is?
screenjunkies Wtf even I know star wars reference and the back to the future reference.
screenjunkies Did Hal hook up with Hailey for Valentines day?
screenjunkies Ive learnt women are self involved and uncultured from this video.
screenjunkies it was still not a make out scene, I kiss my mom and sisters like that
screenjunkies I dont think I would ever want to be with someone who doesnt know star wars, peter gabriel and back to the future. Id rather spend it alone
screenjunkies Edward Cullen and Katniss Everdeen. They both love trees.
screenjunkies Id like to see Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs go on a date with Catherine Martin from Silence of the Lambs. Lots of uncomfortable silences, they could eat liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti. Buffalo Bill would bring her a gift of lotion in a basket.
screenjunkies I love eating twizzler.
screenjunkies Who the eff is peter gaybriel
screenjunkies and they didnt destroy a Death Star in Empire
screenjunkies You may not like it but say it sucks its just being overly infantile
screenjunkies I thought GL Females were like 200lbs, Fat , Nasty, Missing Teeth, Drug users, Drunks, looking for their Prince Charmins, Soul Mates, True loves, have like 2 kids, looking for their Sugar Daddies, 3070 yrs old and just want to go for walks on beaches, snuggle at home, blah, blah, blah, Blah, BLAH!.....?
screenjunkies Could you have picked up worse women than these?
screenjunkies those girls are fucking stupid, how could one of them not get the star wars reference right away?

screenjunkies Best Halftime Show would be if Morgan Freeman narrated the halftime show while, Johnny Depp barges in with a ship and Tony Stark came in with the Avengers and they would have Battle of DISNEY!
screenjunkies Nicolas Cage appears and sings some Rare Earths old tracks. While hes doing it, his hair just change forms in all the hair styles he had in all his roles. In the end, his head starts to burn and he flee with a flaming pepsi motocycle.
screenjunkies please do an honest trailer for battleship. the only alien invasion movie I ever saw in which I rooted for the aliens to win
screenjunkies Nothing beats boobs if were talking super bowl. Dont lie, every man had one fantasy fulfilled that day.

screenjunkies I CANT DO IT GOOD LOL.
screenjunkies Wow, these women are real tarts.
screenjunkies HOLY FUUUCK. That Robin chick was on that Conan Goes to a Halloween Store video. She seems so funny and CHARMing. Robin I know youre reading this, Im so in love with you
screenjunkies Forget Harriet Tubman, Im offended that she does not know who Buffy is.
screenjunkies Witches  people who took Dungeons and Dragons characters too seriously and were made fun of for it. Thus they sat inside too long on the internet and WHAM! You have goatneckcutters.
screenjunkies Woah, Wiccans are real? Why, I thought that was a fairy tale! ...but in all seriousness, thats a thing?
screenjunkies HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
screenjunkies on 1:04, the blonde one says in greek Please Hermes,give me a parking spot,keep it empty so i can use it. its not a spell,greeks say that every minute replacing Hermes with Fucking God
screenjunkies The blonde woman has a mind of a 13 year old girl. Where do ppl like that come from?
screenjunkies I would let that redhead ride my broomstick.
screenjunkies Now I want some chipotle! Thanks Hal. Bye Bye!
screenjunkies This could have been an insightful look into real peoples views on the portrayal of witches, but for some reason youve turned it into a predictable and unfunny piece of pretend journalism that continues to poke fun at them for no good reason.
screenjunkies I just hated the fact that Hansel had sugar sickness. You can get diabetes in TWO ways.Get fat or it just happens. My little brothers got diabetes and hes the skinniest boy Ive ever seen. The type that makes you take blood test every hour...
screenjunkies Youve seen Charmed but you havent seen Buffy?! Go Hal Rudnick!!
screenjunkies witches my a, but i would let em polish my firebolt... ok not the one on the right.
screenjunkies I AM a witch! and black. how come they found the stupidest fucking witches possible to answer the dumbest questions ever? im sooooo pissed.
screenjunkies KKDSJFGJKDJ LOMAOAOO!!OMG She answered that so quick too I can She wants your dick man.
screenjunkies 1:281:32 Pictured an immediate explosion graphic with Pewdiepie saying Nailed it!
screenjunkies Trust me dude, if there was a spell to make your dick bigger it would be on the front page of my book of shadows. In fact I would throw out my old book of shadows and start a new one with penis maker bigger spell on the front page and get more pussy spell on page two.
screenjunkies Lolololol! The blonde witch is simply saying in (modern) Greek, My Hermes, give me a parking spot, keep it empty for me. Lets not even go into the fact that Hermes was never seen as a deity which was in any way concerned with spaces (and I dont think the messenger of Zeus would give much of a fck), but why is there not even an effort to try to use some classical Greek in there...
screenjunkies Parking spot spelleverything everyone wants in life.
screenjunkies Clearly there is only one conclusion, this video isnt funny.
screenjunkies I didn t know asking something in Greek qualifies as a spell :pI hope these girls have some other powers to go with Greek, because I know about 10 million people for which asking things in Greek does not work...
screenjunkies These witch people are total freaks.
screenjunkies Made me think of Pinocchio Vampire Slayer comic, would like to see that as an anime or something, dont know about liveaction, pinocchio lying and staking vampires with his nose.
screenjunkies i have a clan of werewolfs and am in iintrested in the help of witches above level 12 to buff us when we go on hunts we also have a level 10 clown specced in baloon magic. a lvl 15 shiteater specced dihare and a lvl 11 catholic priest who just seem to like children a lot
screenjunkies I dont know if I should laugh or cry at those girls. Poor fools.
screenjunkies he was being such a douche
screenjunkies at 3:40, she had to think about her answer and she looked away from him while answering. Conclusion: she eats children.
screenjunkies There are no witches in this, just an idiot interviewing a dopey ginger and two hambeasts
screenjunkies chipotle is awesome!!!!
screenjunkies At least the witches in the movies were far more pretty, sry :P
screenjunkies I love how he just waste peoples time and never takes it seriously.
screenjunkies how manny children have you eaten?lol man that was great.
screenjunkies Hahaha the first Witch just said Find me a parking spot in Greek :P Wow some witchcraft!
screenjunkies Dont call wiccans stupid bitches! We dont call christians stupid for believing that having sex before getting a permission slip from the church sends you to hell. So our practices are a little strange. Why should you care? You dont need to do them. The only reason the we dont christians practices are weird is because we are so used to them. So please, try to be a little nicer for once in your life.
screenjunkies witches are people who believe in mother earth and father sky. i am a witch and the way that we are seen in the media is just all wrong. we dont eat children, nor own any flying monkies, nor fly on broom sticks. we cast spells, worship the earth and all that was given to us through her, and are peaceful human beings.
screenjunkies wait, your a fucking dick?
screenjunkies These people are full of shit.
screenjunkies Jesus is not a fairytale, and thats really offensive.
screenjunkies The guy interviewing them is such a tool.
screenjunkies Alice the slayer of cards
screenjunkies Damn that guys face looks like a rats face. I cant stop thinking of a rat every week, almost...
screenjunkies Lmfao those chicks were batshit crazy
screenjunkies Red riding hood wolf slayer or jack the bean slayer
screenjunkies Selfish evil creatures.Oh, I want a parking spot so Ill just force someone else out of it.
screenjunkies I was waiting for him to bring up Harry Potter.
screenjunkies The first spell was in greek. It meant: please give me a parking
screenjunkies Ive never laughed so hard at a youtube video in my life.
screenjunkies Im not the biggest fan of witchcraft, but Hansel and Gretel was some sucky movie.
screenjunkies I support any religion that doesnt promote willfully evil acts. I dont know that much about Wicca but I dont think Ive heard any credible bad things about them. There are bad people in every demographic, I think anyone who considers themselves a good person needs to realize that otherwise youre just part of the problem.
screenjunkies And these type of women are the reason they are never taken seriously...  Ive researched witchcraft and practiced it much of my former life, but if I go to see a film about Hansel and Gretel, I do not expect to see a portrayal of what witches may be like... I expect to see them portrayed as they would have been during the days the fairy tale was made. Which was cursing crops, eating children and generally causing havoc... Id be pissed if it didnt give that.
screenjunkies Those bitches are dumb!
screenjunkies I dont know if it count as a fairy tale. Dr Dolittle baby seal abortionist would sound like a pretty gruesome Disney reboot! What do you think?
screenjunkies I used to really like screen junkies but this video is fing stupid. I think every one has a right to believe in what they want to and these women are Wiccan and you invite them to see this movie that makes their religion into a joke and a gimmick to then make them into jokes themselves. I am not Wiccan, I dont really have a religion but this would be the same as a movie making Jewish peopleschristian peoplesMuslim peoples ect..out to be monsters children eaters and evil. Real Pagans and Wiccans through out history have had their way of life ripped from them like most others. They have been killed and run out and had their cultures morphed into tacky plastic cauldrons and hats..I think you guys are a holes and can go f yourselves.
screenjunkies come on! real witches? thats like saying real vampires, or real undead
screenjunkies 1:03 bitch that aint a spell, that is greek... If it was that easy id be fucking gandalf
screenjunkies Xman made me realize that Im just a bit too subtle.
screenjunkies Mind fuck, Buff and Charmed was on the same channel, and this chick didnt know !!!!
screenjunkies wtf the parking spell she just tells in Greek and not ancient Greek or latin normal new Greek : god pls give me a parking spot
screenjunkies Dont mind me, just a Christian passing through.
screenjunkies Since when speaking Greek makes you cast spells hahahahha lol at the blond bitch.Ermi mou se parakalo dose mou mia parkiera, kratise tin anihti gia menaGEEZUS!!!!
screenjunkies Their parking spot spell is just a sentence in Greek, she says please give me a parking spot keep it open for me please... and some of the words are pronounced wrong lol!!!
screenjunkies they go on about witches being portrayed badly but dont they end up having a witch being the good guy in the end ?
screenjunkies ok wtf ? :P this chick just said give me a parking spot and keep it clear for me in greek ... :P :P hell of a witch :P
screenjunkies The reason witches are made to look evil is because we have a horned god who somehow they connect with the devil and the casting of spells that they somehow connect with the devil, even though WE DONT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE DEVIL! I think there is a huge ignorance to the whole witch thing being bad and stuff, we are made to look ugly and evil .....like really? Wicca (no exactly the same thing) is also picked on like that (some do practice magic), we are a religion however small just cuz we dont go to church and have a set standard doesnt make us any less of a religion and I dont like the way we are portrayed.
screenjunkies How can you not know who Harriet Tubman is?!
screenjunkies Omfg, lost my Shit. Fucking idiots!!!
screenjunkies really these girls think they can cast spells wow just wow , just wow, wow
screenjunkies So to cast a spell, all you have to do is mutter in fake Italian? Real witches. Wow.
screenjunkies I could not stop laughing at the spell casting.
screenjunkies The redhead witch sure put a spell on me. Made my penis bigger and everything.
screenjunkies I think the way he treated these three woman was horrible. This is their religion. Would you sit down and disrespect a Catholic, Muslim or a Jewish persons faith in such a way? Just because you do not believe in a religion does NOT give you the right to belittle someone elses beliefs, even if it is not considered to be a mainstream religion or even if people do not understand it. Not only did you question their religious beliefs continuously through the interview which you would never do it a Christian person, you were rude, down right offensive and it was obvious how uncomfortable you made these three woman feel.
screenjunkies That fat one totally eats children.
screenjunkies So apparently, anyone living in Greece is speaking in a language used to conjure magic.What the fuck?
screenjunkies What. Is. Wrong. With. These. Idiots.How does that even portray modern day witches poorly when its a fictional movie based on a fairy tale? If it was set in 2014, then id get it, a little.
screenjunkies unrealistic . . .Skanks with rotting bodies flying on broom sticks, gizmos and gadgets that never existed in any century, and a troll the size of Dwayne Johnson. Somehow I dont think they were going for realism. XD And for all the real life version of witches that exist, there is OBVIOUSLY the fictional, fairytale version that gets used by Hollywood.
screenjunkies The ginger one sat on the left looks like shes a lot of fun to hang out with.
screenjunkies I liked how she had to think about if she ate children or not. Haha
screenjunkies Would you call this movie your Schindlers list? What the fuck kinda question is that xD
screenjunkies Quick question: what the fuck is a real witch?
screenjunkies WE NEED MORE OF THESE CELEBRITY VISITS!!!!
screenjunkies DUPSTEP KILLS ZOMBIES
screenjunkies MY favorite way to kill a zombie is to use cheese wirepiano wire and cut the head off of the zombie while applying pressure on the back of its neck with your boot and then driving over the severed head.
screenjunkies sonic screwdriver them in the face
screenjunkies Rip their head of and drop a Duce down their neck
screenjunkies I cant tell if thats actually a real brain hes eating...
screenjunkies Harsh language is my favorite weapon against zombies.
screenjunkies hmm.. I go with Decapitate and burn the body in style from John Sinclair Ghosthunter. Better make sure the zombie dies, oh if there is bunch of them, I would love a flamethrower and handgrenades
screenjunkies I might have squealed when Dave Franco showed up...
screenjunkies The best way to kill an zombie is to show them twilight
screenjunkies How can people question whether this is serious? Obviously its a joke .
screenjunkies I would splice the head of a great white shark on to my right arm and a laser machine gun hammer sword on the the other... Also when I sleep the shark keeps watch and eats zombies trying to sneak up on me (Awesome)... I enjoyed warm bodies, nice movie :D
screenjunkies i really laughed at this !!!!
screenjunkies to kill the zombie: annoy them to death with Justin bieber music
screenjunkies The romantic zombie comedy Warm Bodies devoured the box office competition this weekend
screenjunkies this is hilarious! Love some Rob Corddry
screenjunkies You deserve the tshirt
screenjunkies We should take all the zombie kill suggestions and try them out on the likes of Taylor Lange and gaiassia. How do these people think that this mockumentry is real? Wow. !!! Rob is awesome. Franco is much funnier and talented then his gay older brother.
screenjunkies Catch a zombie, place brains inside the head of the zombie. He will rip his own head into pieces to get the brain.
screenjunkies id like to touch her boobs
screenjunkies I cant tell if hes honest in this interview or just bullshitting us.
screenjunkies Best way to kill a zombie is to push my ex wife to the ground and crush it by running the zombie over with her enormously overweight body! Nothing can survive that!.......... Splat! Zombie kill of the month!
screenjunkies Now thats just cruel, you heartless bastartd!!!!!
screenjunkies Always with m134 mini gun or AA 12 or SW 500 MAGNUM. or if not ketana to the head chain saw works too spiki bassboll bat nail dynemit.
screenjunkies He is just not funny. I hate him in just about everything hes in. Rob douche
screenjunkies Best way to kill a zombie for me is to snipe them from a helicopter distance is best and either a silencer or suppressor so to cause the zombies to go in one direction or so they dont know what hit them.
screenjunkies 3:30 ROFL did he touch u ? nods head take it all off
screenjunkies Rob Corddry was the worst and least convincing zombie in that movie. He wasnt struggling to talk at all, he was just whispering.
screenjunkies I would struggle him with that ugly tshirt of screen junkies. I still like your show though
screenjunkies my favoite way to kill a zombie: NUKE!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Haley Boaz so many things wrong with your statement first of all a silencer and suppressor are the same thing. Second if you were in a helicopter dont you think that the zombies would be attracted to that? So why even bother with a suppressor when you are in a helicopter?
screenjunkies Best way to kill a zombie is to drop a paino on its head. Old school but effective.
screenjunkies Ninja stars... Nuff said
screenjunkies Did he just say The Walking Dead was bullshit I am going to kill him
screenjunkies Most effective way to kill zombie: punch to bladder.
screenjunkies I am strangely very, very attracted to Rob Corddry... even in zombie makeup. Not to actual zombies, mind. Just Rob Corddry. Is that weird? I feel like that might be a little weird.
screenjunkies Kill zombies? You monsters! Havent you seen Fido?
screenjunkies Why kill the zombie? Just give them a hug! :D
screenjunkies Its scary that I cant tell if this is fake or not.
screenjunkies Haley Boaz so many things wrong with your statement first of all a silencer and suppressor are the same thing. Second if you were in a helicopter dont you think that the zombies would be attracted to that? So why even bother with a suppressor when you are in a helicopter?
screenjunkies This is retarded and unfunny.
screenjunkies Best way to kill a zombie is to drop a paino on its head. Old school but effective.
screenjunkies Ninja stars... Nuff said
screenjunkies Did he just say The Walking Dead was bullshit I am going to kill him
screenjunkies Most effective way to kill zombie: punch to bladder.
screenjunkies Nick James .and thatAll Folks
screenjunkies Spikes baseball bat (iron one)
screenjunkies Wow wolverine ever heard of wax??
screenjunkies The best way to kill a zombie is to get its attention so its limping towards you, run up duck down cut the legs off so its crawling around... And then make it come towards you again and stab its head.... Unless its R... :)
screenjunkies Anyone who thinks this is actually real is pretty slow and is obviously not familiar with Rob Corddry.

screenjunkies probably Schindlers list
screenjunkies I agree with human centipede
screenjunkies Twilight action figures... very offensive
screenjunkies Schindlers List functioning shower and mass grave set.
screenjunkies Whats offensive? I saw the movie and liked it, they didnt go after white guys, they were people with bounties on their heads whose deaths were permitted by the state (except for when Djangos professor friend whatshisname shoots so and so which causes the tete a tete towards the end). Its a movie about people in strange situations making a living, Django just happened to be a freed slave. All this is is pussification of the public. Kids used to play with cowboy toys, now were being told that anything that references vigilantism in the past is offensive. How about we just all act like adults and not ban any toys unless theyre meant for little kids and contain little parts they could swallow and stop caring about what is and isnt PC?Also, I am trying to come up with an answer but I think you nailed it with Human Centipede action figures.

screenjunkies Ill probably get harsh burns for this but I dont think the word nigger, negro, black manwoman or anything like that is offensive to say. If people are white, we refer to them as white, and no one sees a problem in that. Why is if a problem when we do it with people whos skin colour is brown of black? If theres a 100 people with the same haircut, same clothes, same height, same everything, but youre looking for your friend Steve, and hes white, and the 99 other people are brown or black or anything else, is it bad to say hes the white one? And if its the other way around, is it a bad thing to say that hes the black one? I understand that when its used as an insult, like some people do (i.e. that goddamned blackwhite guy), of course I understand that theyre offended, but its not always used as an insult. Caucasian is a race, hispanic is a race, african is a race, white is a colour, beige is a colour, brown is a colour. Why be offended by a wordcolour? Why try so hard to come up with a different word, that isnt even correct most of the times (read: people who refer to all brown people as africanamerican)? I understand why they get offended, those words are used as insults, but its time we stop using and seeing them as insults. Theyre words, theyre colours, theyre the colours of our skins, and that should in no possible way be a bad thing.
screenjunkies I literally have NO idea why it would be offensive, someone pls tell me.

screenjunkies Legenda o de Indiana Jones!
screenjunkies Legenda Batman DKR please!
screenjunkies I dont think Tarantinos role in Django was meant to be solid. It was comic relief. Not saying comedies have a pass, but its like Shakespeare. You have an intense story until it gets boring. The boring point is where you add in the comic relief. It was like that in Pulp Fiction, but Ill say Tarantinos acting in Pulp Fiction was much better.
screenjunkies Cloud Atlas was one of the worst movies I have ever seen!
screenjunkies I really liked cloud atlas i just think it fell flat like any post matrix: the revolution wachowski film is wont to do. but imagine if it didnt fall flat hmmmmmm?
screenjunkies The Amazing SpiderMan was great! Better than 2002s! Except we didnt need the retold origin.
screenjunkies The Amazing Spiderman deserved to win a Razzie. It was awful, oversimplified, and it even ruined the good Spiderman movies because I now know that Hollywood cant just leave good franchises alone.
screenjunkies So many people say that the Amazing SpiderMan film was so much better than the first Spidey film. I was one of them for the longest time, but as the hype kinda wears off, I can easily say that both films were better than each other in certain aspects. Both were great in their own ways. SpiderMan had a more compelling villain. The Amazing SpiderMan had better supporting characters (besides Aunt May). Both did great jobs with Uncle Ben. SpiderMan was a more rewatchable movie (Probably due to its lighthearted nature). The Amazing SpiderMan had a better Peter Parker and SpiderMan as a whole. The Amazing SpiderMan had a much better New Yorkers help out Spidey scene (Crane operator with a debt to Spidey aids in quick travel for injured hero vs. random NY citizens with preplanned speeches for Goblin and cars full of rotten food and misc. junk to throw while Spidey saves perpetually screaming redhead and kids). SpiderMan had a more memorable music score (The strings and percussion played in a way that totally gave the score a creepy spider movement vibe, whereas I hardly remember TASM score and I watched it for the 15th time, yesterday). Its really hard to be subjective because I grew up on SpiderMan cartoons, so I fell in love with the first two Spidey movies. Heck, my first comic was a SpiderMan comic. But we have to face the reality that neither of the two franchises are perfect, but they have their moments. I really hope that Marvel doesnt get the movie rights for Spidey back for a while, because we all know what theyd do with him (see Ultimate SpiderMan cartoon on Disney Channel). Id like to grow old and die before I ever see Spidey ruined like that on the big screen!
screenjunkies Nick Mundy really annoys me. He always just takes a deep breath and starts shouting, Awesome. How about you calm down a little and say something meaningful?
screenjunkies Please, never invite the fat guy again
screenjunkies Hey, the Amazing SpiderMan was great! Better than the original!
screenjunkies I highly disagree about Milla Jovovich. Maybe the movie was bad, but Milla plays her role as Alice really really good. The plot holes and goofs about her character arent her fault. She made the best out of it.
screenjunkies The Oogieloves in Big Balloon Adventure was mentioned as a nominee but never talked about. Why did your directors or writers or ANYONE not give you a tap on the shoulder? Does anyone review these videos before they get posted?Also, there was no structure to this. It could have been a real discussion, THAT would have been enjoyable to watch. That doesnt mean it cant be funny, but all this was was random smartass remarks and complaining.
screenjunkies that guy who looks like Santa sounds flamboyantly gay.
screenjunkies Michael Barrytel almost lost all my respect for him with that Amazing SpiderMan comment. Its not copying plot points. Its about being faithful to the source material. He doesnt understand that both SpiderMan movies were based on the same comic book. And Amazing SpiderMan did SpiderMans origin better. You cared more about Peter, more from Gwen than Mary Jane, and more for Uncle Ben and Aunt May (who were really strongly written characters this time, (RIP Cliff Robertson).
screenjunkies How in the frick did After Earth not make every category for the Razzis?
screenjunkies Was dissappointed with this episode guys ..sorry!...I was waiting for SANTA to lean across the table and make NICK the NEW SANTA!! ..He touches NICKS chubby little finger ..THEN....(cue sparkles!.. stars and mystical whirlwinds!..) .........TA DAH!!....NICK would have looked down at his new red costume..and said....:OH!..MY!...GOD!....I LOOK SO FKN AWESOME!!!!......AND ex santa SAYS .. OK...Now that thats over with!...SHOW ME MORE shit movies!!...
screenjunkies Cloud Atlas was great. Just gotta look at it at more than face value. (Plus Bae Doona was awesome but totally overlooked cause no one knew her.)
screenjunkies Breaking Dawn part 2 is good!
screenjunkies FAT MAN LIKES TO SHOUT!!! FATMAN SAY LOUD WORDS... if there were razzies for worst panel member then FAT MAN WHO SHOUTS would definitely get it..
screenjunkies Well, you need these bad movies in order to appreciate the good ones.
screenjunkies I would rather have Nick Mundy host Screen Junkies, hes funny even though hes always shouting.
screenjunkies twilight really gets shit on by people. and it deserves every bit of it, it sucks ass, the end.
screenjunkies WWE Films is Snubbed again.
screenjunkies Cloud Atlas was a class film if youre intelligent enough to actually concentrate and appreciate the structures of the story.
screenjunkies The Razzie award was made by people that failed at everything in Hollywood and then came up with an award to takeout theyre anger and hatred on those who succeeded.Just like people who become movie critics.
screenjunkies thousand words was a great movie I loved that movie it made laugh cry
screenjunkies I like how Peter in Spiderman is a loser but hes attractive, smart, and can skate board. I dont get how that works
screenjunkies I thought Battleship was pretty good
screenjunkies FUCK YOU YOU STUPID LITTLE BITCH I bet you know fuck all about spider man, or the comics or anything. And the arent copying and pasting they are staying true to the origin, what do you want, for them to do it differently then Marc web would get so much black lash. You dumb fuck, stick to Star Wars which I bet you also not little about
screenjunkies Well deserved Razzie, screen junkies, well deserved.
screenjunkies I think the year the Sandra Bullock got the Best Actress Oscar, she got the Razzie for Worst Actress and accepted it. Thats awesome.
screenjunkies Hey, Cloud Atlas was not a piece of garbage.
screenjunkies Amazing SpiderMan was not remake. It was the first live action SpiderMan movie that actually felt like it was based off the comic books. The Tobey Maguire movies seemed like they were made by someone one vaguely knew who SpiderMan was  maybe read one of the comics once.
screenjunkies Nick Mundy is incredibly annoying and talks over everyone. Yelling something really loudly does not make it fact. He makes it really hard to enjoy any screen junkies show he is in.
screenjunkies Santa is in charge of the razzies?
screenjunkies I never thought I say this but I agree with Nick Mudy about Tyler Perry watching His movies are like taking a shit in your eyes and ice cream
screenjunkies Look at all these white guys hating on madea..
screenjunkies I thought Cloud Atlas was very well made and it stuck to the source material
screenjunkies I can not keep watching your show and continue holding this in. You look like Joe Rogan. That MMA announcer guy dude, that looks like he is a fighter, but is really a comedian? Battle Ship was brutal, but man was it bad, but not so brutal as watching G.I Joe 2. The guy with one leg was the best actor in the Battle Ship movie, and he was not even a trained actor i think?Thousand words was bad but it had a point and something of a plot.  Yeah, Tyler Perry was really bad in that action movie. lets not see him in another action flick. Barbara Streisand was the worst performance of them all.  No one pays attention to Q.T. and his little roles in his movies. They are so bad we enjoy them.
screenjunkies John Wilson reminds me of a love child between Santa Claus an Zack Galafinakis.
screenjunkies Um wtf is Nick talking about? Cloud Atlas is not even close to deserving being nominated for a razzie so he can shut it.
screenjunkies Im not defending Amazing Spiderman Im saying it sucked! Gosh dammit! I hated that movie!
screenjunkies worst director M. Night Shymalan
screenjunkies Too short. Felt like it could have been longer, or was and is the victim of the editing room floor.
screenjunkies You forgot After Earth
screenjunkies Amazing SpiderMan was dope
screenjunkies Here is one for the future,Ben Affleck in Man Of Steel 2.
screenjunkies Nick Mundy should win one for being loud and lame. Hes like Chris Farley only not funny in any way.
screenjunkies Most of the stuff I heard in this video is a load of rubbish lol
screenjunkies Is everyone forgetting the chick from dark knight rises? Worst death scene ever! Guess they already hit their budget for the movie so they couldnt replace her since she was doing so well up until that point and just said f it, cut, and print it. Guess they thought she would take away from all the other mistakes and unexplainable scenarios in the movie. Well guessed wrong, just made the list longer.
screenjunkies I love adam sandlers old stuff, why did he become so shit
screenjunkies Every unknown actor from the last airbender
screenjunkies anyone who thinks robert pattinson is a bad actor should watch how to deal.
screenjunkies Amazing SpiderMan was Amazing
screenjunkies Well, at least Hal was kind enough to accept the award they deserve. Screen Junkies should quit making this stupid show, that doesnt discuss anything in detail, and is playing just long enough to piss you off. Stick to what youre good at, Honest Trailers. Its the only reason people subscribe anyway.
screenjunkies worst picture: Gravity
screenjunkies Thank you Michael Barryte for mentioning Amazing Spiderman. Ughhhh that movie.
screenjunkies Oogieloves is good for what its trying to be and enjoyable to its intended audience.
screenjunkies my three: twilight, mouthbreather and sparkly vampire. I hope to god that franchise gets buried to the darkest parts of the world and gets completely forgotten. Thats saying a lot, cause i despise Milla Jovovich for staring in RE movie series that has forever buried any hope of a good RE movie for a long time, thanks to Paul Anderson who hasnt directed a good movie period, and the fact that Tyler Perry was basically nominated TWICE for worst actor, I mean damn you gotta have skill at bad acting to get it twice but I STILL want twilight to win in all three catagories.Rant. Over.
screenjunkies 2013 Razzie nominees are out!Oogieloves in the Big ADHD Adventure. Twilight 4.2. Tyler Perry for worst actor and actress. I love these guys!http:www.razzies.com
screenjunkies Why does everyone hate on Tyler perry so much. I think made a is funny as hell I get maybe its cheap humor but hes still crazy funny. :)
screenjunkies shit in the ice cream hahahaaaa
screenjunkies Nick Mundy is a lowfunctioning mentally disabled fuckface. Ruined it.
screenjunkies dude who can trash talk cloud atlas? Who are you lol. What was the last movie you saw that was so different? Trash talk battleship all you want, but your not watching the same movie if you didnt like it
screenjunkies The games playing itself Jon. THE GAMES PLAYING ITSELF!
screenjunkies Razzies are not the only award shows that show the worst in film.
screenjunkies Adam Sandler resurfaces in the 2013 RAZZIE Nominations still not surprised! lol
screenjunkies As for The Amazing SpiderMan, it wipes the floor with SpiderMan 3, and some of the part one, too.Ok, that is my opinion. But, seriously, Spidey 3 could not have been WORSE than it was.When people talk about the BatmanSpidermanSuperman movies, and the way they are portrayed onscreen, it is quite tough, because over the years, ALL of these superheroes went through MANY TRANSFORMATIONS, REIMAGINATIONS, REINVENTIONS, reworked origin stories. So, if you like the 1960s Spidey, you like Sam Raimi and his Spidey 1 and 2. If you like the 1950s Superman, you like Superman 1 and 2 (actually, if you like ANY ERA Superman, most people love Donners FIRST TWO Superman movies. The less said about the other 2, the better. Suffice to say, Singers Superman Returns was WAY better than those two, aside from the WORST Lois ever, Kate Bosworth, an overrated actress).What some people do not understand is that the carefree, childlikeinnocentkookykiddy versions of some superheroes CANNOT work in todays world. EVERYTHING WAS DIFFERENT, whether in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s or 90s. Everything reflects the changing of the times. The politics, the comic books, the movies, the TV shows, music, fashion, technology. WE SHOULD ALL TAKE ALL THIS INTO ACCOUNT, even when we talk aboutreview movies that are remade, reimagined or rebooted. There are many cultoriginal moviescartoonsTV shows that arewere VERY MUCH overrated (no need to get into detail here, just go online and check for yourselves).Tastes and opinions are subjective, the things we lovepeople we likemoviescartoons that we watch, music we listen to. But we should give everything a chance, well, anything that has any trace of QUALITY, ORIGINALITY, COOLNESS, COMPETENCE, TALENT, EFFORT behind it. If it has NONE of this, let it disappear from this world. That is quite simple really, we are human, we have brains, we know how to use them!Cheers :)
screenjunkies Battleship couldve been a Really Great movie, if it had a better director, better script, and better actors along with better visual effects! It couldve very well been a landmark blockbuster such as Jurassic Park, Terminator 2, Aliens, Independence Day, Avatar, etc!
screenjunkies Nick Mundy is hated so much. He needs to change his act.
screenjunkies Cloud Atlas was a terrible movie.
screenjunkies Twilight, let it die already.I still remember I got fooled my ex gf to watch the 1st twilight show.Got vamp and werewolf? Really....got excited .Definitely not underworld....
screenjunkies You know, Battleship was really stupid, but atleast it was entertaining.
screenjunkies The Amazing SpiderMan sucked, Andrew Garfield made Peter Parker look like a fucking asshole. The entire cast sucked except for Gwen Stacey, the lizard, and Dennis Leary.
screenjunkies 2013 RAZZIE Nominations: Worst in Movies! 2013 RAZZIE Nominations: Worst in Movies!
screenjunkies Was this the episode Hal was talking in the Easter egg episode? Whats up with the hand?
screenjunkies Some more ideas to potentially fix Die Hard 6:Bring the setting back to Nakatomi PlazaBring back John McClanes everyman status by making his age a factorGo the Last Cruade route and cast Clint Eastwood as John McClanes father.Recast John McClanes son (maybe with Channing Tatum?)Hans Grubers son played by Daniel Radcliffe?
screenjunkies Die Hard 5...the biggest Mercedes advert ever.
screenjunkies Die Hard has the biggest fall from grace of any action movie franchise.At this point its like a Scooby Doo cartoon Every time John ventures out to the grocery store for milk... terrorist hijinks ensue.
screenjunkies Id like to see less Super Hero movies. Seriously, EVERY SINGLE comic book character doesnt need a freaking reboot. Am I the only one here who thinks that Genre has been totally played out? It was a good run while it lasted but now its just tired and annoying. Lets take a step back and move on to something else.
screenjunkies The Die Hard series ended with Die Harder.All the themes that made up the first two movies were removed in the third, and they couldnt even bring back any of the recurring cast members. Everything that comes after is just a Bruce Willis action movie where he also happens to be named John McClane.
screenjunkies Die Hard 6 Im getting too old for this shit!
screenjunkies whats with the fake hand?
screenjunkies How to fix die hard 5..... Stop making the Fucking movies
screenjunkies I thought I was gonna see Bruce Willis totter around on a zimerframe with guns on.
screenjunkies Did you seriously just say the first movie was believable???? Really?????
screenjunkies JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE HARD
screenjunkies Die hard 1,2 and 4 were the best out of the whole films.
screenjunkies Your Junk talks? OMG!
screenjunkies I liked the 4th Die Hard, but the 5th was terrible.
screenjunkies I dont get why Hal has a fake hand : Oh and JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE HARD :)
screenjunkies .. um what a weird fake hand.. you shoulda atleast done something with it.. like something neat.. instead of just having a fake hand for no reason at all
screenjunkies JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE HARD
screenjunkies in that trailer bruce either looks extremely bored, or he wants to fuck his son, i mean look at his eyes im just imagining attempting to put the buzzcut behind the dudes ear.
screenjunkies The villain for Die hard 6 should be Hans Grubers son
screenjunkies Bruce Willis has been bored since With A Vengeance. Hes become a paycheck chaser
screenjunkies Only the good Die Hard
screenjunkies Grow your hair out!!!! XD
screenjunkies No lie, I fell asleep during the middle of Die Hard 5
screenjunkies WTF is wit dat hand X::: D it looks like a hollowcast P (sorry for not being sorry i just made a holocaust joke, its on my bucket list, wish me death if you see fit to lol)
screenjunkies Die Hard 6 title Just die or die trying
screenjunkies It was believable that bruce willis fought with 12 terrorists? really
screenjunkies Its actually Spartacus:Blood and Sand and Jai Courtnetys Character Varro was one of the best on the show his friendship with Spartacus was brilliant! (Watch it Guys)
screenjunkies John Tucker Must Die Hard
screenjunkies Die hard 5 was one of the worst films I ever saw
screenjunkies Die Hard 5 was fine... only part i agree with is needing more practical stunts and effects... death by helicopter? just throw a guy in a helicopter blade.
screenjunkies the new die hard is called die hardest
screenjunkies THAT FAT TWAT NEEDS TO DIE!
screenjunkies Say: Yippie Kay Yay!, Motherf!
screenjunkies They should do a Die Hard version of Last Action Hero, its 2020 and a the last die hard movie is made, Die Hard 12, and its terrible. all cgi crap, including a cgi Bruce Willis. Then a kid goes to see it and magicly falls into the movie and teaches John mclane about his roots, and how Die Hard should be, slowly the movie turns to be good, and the cgi bruce turns into a real bruce. STUPID I KNOW! But it would be so funny, and who knows, might be good!
screenjunkies What is a Gruber? Can someone explain to me, please?
screenjunkies Never attempt to recapture 80s magic.
screenjunkies Nick Mundy is awesome
screenjunkies What was with the fake hand and then never referencing it? Great show though. My new years resolution is to do more actual work at the office. Got to sign off now!
screenjunkies HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
screenjunkies If they decide to make more Die Hard movies they should stick to basics as fatty boy here said, and quit putting John McClane in ridiculous situations. They should follow Die Hard ones storyline where at first McClane wasnt a happy triger, and they could start by following his carrer from patrolman to detective and romancing Holly Gennaro. Die Hard must not be turned into a crappy summer blockbuster attempt, holding a good plot will have us series fans happy and paying for movie tickets.
screenjunkies Die Hard: Electric Boogaloo Die Harder Than The Previous Die Hard Die Hardcules in New York Die Hard Boiled Egg

screenjunkies the die hard movies are begining to die hard
screenjunkies It should be called Die Hard of Natural Causes.

screenjunkies Die hard without John McClane smoking will never achieve perfection.
screenjunkies Nick makes me laugh so much. I relate to his rage so much lol
screenjunkies The Die Hard series is beyond repair after this travesty and the last. Please Bruce we know you are an old sellout, but you should have at least let your best character die hard with some dignity.
screenjunkies i wasnt sure until now, but you are fucking with me. congrats you had me going for a while
screenjunkies y does he have a fake arm?
screenjunkies A love NICK MUNDY. He is pure entertainment.
screenjunkies That guy has some decent points but I think he is putting on an act to try and seem really outraged. And to be blunt, he is not that good of an actor. Sorry, and Im not trying to be a troll or mean etc. To steal a phrase Im just show him how to fix this video
screenjunkies More Nick Munday, hes awesome.
screenjunkies I have watched this video so many times and I just noticed is fake hand in the beginning and end...
screenjunkies 4:35 Die Hardest! da :)
screenjunkies Did anyone else notice he did this entire video with a fake right arm?
screenjunkies Die Hard 18: This dude just isnt gonna fucng die hard, is he
screenjunkies The Last Stand was good in the fix ur referring
screenjunkies i only liked the fourth one because timothy olyphant was the bad guy, other then that...
screenjunkies Just fking Die Already You fking cts!!!!
screenjunkies Now THAT was funny! Maybe they should go total camp in the die hard 6 with all the cliches and call it Old Habits Die Hard I might actually go see that. I love satire.
screenjunkies 4:32  Fake arm?? Funny, cuz if you go to google and search hal rudnick fake arm video this one pops up... at least for me
screenjunkies Bought the 25th anniversary of Die Hard Collection which includes 14. Thats all I need. FUCK A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD. It was garbage.
screenjunkies PS The movie Rocked! It is you who needs to get over your stupid anger over where they placed a stupid line!
screenjunkies wow, i remember the whole movie, its bland. i bet you also think any of the fights in transformers was good. just because there were gun fights and explosions doesnt mean its a fun movie. diehard 4 is a fun movie. die hard 5 have one half decent car chase at the beginning, drops off for 40 min after the hotel and has a boring fight at the end, dont even get me started on the plot
screenjunkies I think I found an easter egg....
screenjunkies just because there were gun fights and explosions doesnt mean its a fun movie Doesnt mean its not a fun movie either. The problem with you is if a movie isnt exactly the way you expect it to be you hate it regardless of the content. Proof? Simple, You havent once criticized the story line its self and you cant criticize the film with out putting your own emotions in to it or not mention the fact it has explosions. Fights are not boring your board with fights. I love the plot. Get Started
screenjunkies Possible titles for the new Die Hard movie:  Go Big Or Die Hard  If Gives You A Lemon Die Hard  Die Harder Than Youve Ever Died Before
screenjunkies Underneath all your yelling and rage and fuck, you forgot to add one of the best elements of Die Hard 1 and 2, make it Christmas time again! 1. Make it Christmas Eve again. 2. Make it R rated. 3. Have a great bad villain. 4. Confine John McClane to a particular spaced area, like a building or an airport. 5. Stop making Die Hard look like an ordinary modern action flick, take to back to its classic look and sound.
screenjunkies make a video of How to FIX the Lone Ranger and R.I.P.D!
screenjunkies There will be no Die Hard 6, the last film destroyed the franchise.
screenjunkies lol hal rudnicks fake hand at the beginning of the video
screenjunkies Die Hard 6: Die Harder Die Hard 7: Die Even Harder than That Die Hard 8: Die Much Harder
screenjunkies I hate Obama and Gun Scenes you get an education. And no it proves the movie sucked. The other die hard films are gold and im a 23 year old with more wit about movies than you
screenjunkies Live Long and Die Hard
screenjunkies I dont have doubt that Die Hard 5 have the same background of Silent Hill 4. Hey we can change the name of the characters and call it Die Hard, will sell more.
screenjunkies awee. that was a sad in memorium :
screenjunkies What the fuck??!! Is he peeing fire at 2:13?!
screenjunkies FUCK YOU HAL!!!!! YOU JUST RUINED THE END OF THE GRAY FOR ME!!! FUCK YOU!!!!!!
screenjunkies The Christopher Nolan award should go to World War Z, for the most obligatory use of that sound
screenjunkies John Travolta still had dignity in 2012???
screenjunkies Well, they were sure wrong about the Andy Samberg part.
screenjunkies I hate anna Kendricks face why cant anyone agree with me?
screenjunkies I liked here comes the boom and the watch, but thats my boy was just something I was fine watching for free on HBO but would hate to see in theaters.
screenjunkies I always get teary eyed at that song
screenjunkies Anna Kendrick Award is spot on.
screenjunkies I was searching for the worst movies of 2012, but this is hilarious!
screenjunkies Vyhlaovn cen by Screen Junkies
screenjunkies AHAHAHA!!! the Chris Nolan Award...

screenjunkies where was Adam Sandlers career in IN MEMORIAM
screenjunkies and it was pretty funny when data got his head ripped off
screenjunkies what a shame that HBO cancelled Luck but they could digitalize the horses
screenjunkies Battleship was One of the shittiest Movies ive ever seen. I reckon world war z is gonna be Even worse i hie.
screenjunkies Man forget that. John Carter was legit!
screenjunkies cameron diaz hotness has been dead for quite some time now...
screenjunkies Umm the Grey sucked, anyone who liked it is an idiot
screenjunkies John Carter was actually a good movie! Not great, but fun and enjoyable
screenjunkies Watched this just because of the oscars
screenjunkies That In memoriam song was awesome! hilarious!
screenjunkies Aww they left out Russle Crowes credibility in the in memoriam

screenjunkies in memoriam  best part
screenjunkies Taylor Kitschs career cant be over, Riggins will bounce back
screenjunkies You forgot a hyperlink to the song download in your 2012 Memoriam. BAHAHAA!!!!
screenjunkies i totally agree on Anna Kendrick, she grows on you and you get really horny.
screenjunkies Well, maybe I like this kind of film (and I saw it three times) so I pretty much got it andor found a reason to explain things. The guy turned into a zombie cause of the black gooacid combo that changed his biological makeup.
screenjunkies haha! caught Hal off guard  0:07. love Screenjunkies btw
screenjunkies i want your Ghostbusters stuff !!!!!!
screenjunkies John Travoltas dignity . . . amen to that.
screenjunkies Ya I gotta agree I thought the last of it left a long time ago... you know after Battlefield Earth
screenjunkies Nope. I just watched the movie
screenjunkies Totally agree with you on 1.  Battleship was just as stupid at Transformers, but since it didnt have the same title, it bombed. I really liked Prometheus.
screenjunkies i totally agree on Anna Kendrick, she grows on you and you get really horny.
screenjunkies Aside from HBOs Luck, which I havent seen, I dont agree with any of your statements.
screenjunkies Well, maybe I like this kind of film (and I saw it three times) so I pretty much got it andor found a reason to explain things. The guy turned into a zombie cause of the black gooacid combo that changed his biological makeup.
screenjunkies haha! caught Hal off guard  0:07. love Screenjunkies btw
screenjunkies The Grey was amazing!!!!
screenjunkies i want your Ghostbusters stuff !!!!!!
screenjunkies John Travoltas dignity . . . amen to that.
screenjunkies oh cmon, prometheus wasnt THAT bad.....
screenjunkies Ya I gotta agree I thought the last of it left a long time ago... you know after Battlefield Earth
screenjunkies Nope. I just watched the movie
screenjunkies Totally agree with you on 1.  Battleship was just as stupid at Transformers, but since it didnt have the same title, it bombed. I really liked Prometheus.
screenjunkies Christopher Nolan Award HAHAHAHA!
screenjunkies LOL Awesome song at the end.
screenjunkies just like Uma Thurman, hell have to ask for help to Quentin Tarantino in order to retain his dignity.
screenjunkies This guy reminds me of the comic book shop owner from big bang theory. I think his name is stuart.
screenjunkies DOWNLOAD LINK FOR THE SONG??
screenjunkies It is possible to buy or download the song in the part in memorium Its funny
screenjunkies i would totally do anna kendrick
screenjunkies i was thinking in the chinama when i watched skyfall: ok, in the last part of themovie they dont know what to do and just cut some home alone tricks in.. it will make it mutch more awsome :D
screenjunkies This guy reminds me of Kevin Sussman
screenjunkies NEW CAPITAN AMERICA TRAILER!!!!!!
screenjunkies Lmfaoo, good to know other people notcied that annoying bass sound in every damn big budget trailer lol
screenjunkies Dont forget Hairspray, Wild Hogs and The Punisher
screenjunkies travolta lost his dignity years ago hairspray.
screenjunkies meh  I wouldnt blame Ridley completely for Prometheus  the visuals and set all looked awesome  he did his job, but that script was pinksocked butthole bad.
screenjunkies I love the way Hal says screenies
screenjunkies Sam Worthingtons lucky streak  LOL
screenjunkies we all whant our money back
screenjunkies He still had dignity when he made Pulp Fiction, but come on. Battlefield Earth, The Punisher, Hairspray, Savages?
screenjunkies Oh! I get it! Battlefield Earth right.
screenjunkies haha i thought skyfall was like homealone too!!!
screenjunkies YES. Someone agrees with me about John Carters marketing!!!!!! Man, it was really bad
screenjunkies I actually really enjoyed and liked john carter...
screenjunkies People say the same about Cloud Atlas, but I totally got that film too.
screenjunkies On its own its a halfdecent popcorn movie, but as a supposed Alien prequel, its horse dung.
screenjunkies Didnt the first Alien trailer have the Christopher Nolan effect?
screenjunkies Thats exactly how I feel about about anna kendrick,didnt notice then Im like shit I do her.
screenjunkies Hey! Im really happy that you guys recognised Lena Dunhams body parts, after all the negative press they received.
screenjunkies Promethius was a great movie, but definitely not very easy my friend. Ridley has even stated that he wont review the secrets from it. And why the fuck did that one dude turn into a crazy ass zombie!
screenjunkies Say faith,trust and pixie dust

screenjunkies Deus amado, so tantos pontos abertos que me impressiono como ns, pblico, no percebemos. Ficou hilrio, e tima legenda.
screenjunkies Bundiario de princesa.kkkk
screenjunkies faz iron man, e fast five
screenjunkies intao se for pra procurar defeitos, vamos procurar os defeitos de alguns dos melhores filmes da historia, como Titanic e The Godfather...voce vai achar erros MUITO mais grotescos que esses ai do Batman, e mesmo assim esses filmes nao deixam de ser alguns dos melhores de todos os tempos...
screenjunkies Os erros de Titanic e The Godfather em geral so erros que tem a ver com filmagem e questes de ambientao. Os erros de The Dark Knight Rises so furos de roteiro. E furos de roteiro so menos perdoveis do que erros de ambientao e filmagem. Principalmente vindos da mesma equipe que fez obras primas como Amnsia.
screenjunkies Se voc pedir no canal original talvez tenha mais sorte
screenjunkies voces tenq entender que isso  um filme de super heroi, nada faz sentido, e nao tem nenhuma obrigaao em ter sentido....
screenjunkies kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.. quem assistiu Looper vai entender o Bruce Wilis
screenjunkies Concordo com a Blenda sobre isos ser humor, mas temos que convir que pra uma trilogia que clamava fazer um super heri o mais realista possvel, ele meio que falhou, no acha?
screenjunkies PQP hahahahah!!!! Festival de furos.
screenjunkies Achei que tinha parado  boa traduo
screenjunkies Cara, ningum t reclamando do filme. Isso  humor!
screenjunkies rapaz, mais se voce for procurar, esses furos sempre existiram, afinal  dificil manter a linearidade num personagem que ja foi retratado em em dezenas de versoes diferentes, cada versao com suas caracteristicas e seu enredo...afinal, se voce for ler os quadrinhos, vai encontrar varios furos...intao eu axo q nesse caso, deixar errado,  fazer o certo...e o q prova minha teoria,  q com vc disse, Nolan dirigiu Memento, um dos meus filmes favoritos, ele nao cometeria esses furos sem perceber
screenjunkies Quanta baboseira, coisa da gerao michael bay mesmo. nesse site foi explicado td:
screenjunkies Kkkkkkkkkk , eu ja tinha ficado decepcionado com esse terceiro Batman , esperava muito mais , mas  um bom filme
screenjunkies haehaeahe ai ai cara muito engraado essa porra.
screenjunkies No final foi o mais engraado, Bruce wayne era o batman ?!?!
screenjunkies Muitos erros eu deixei passar quando vi no cinema, mas a morte dela foi demais pra mim, eu ri pra caralho meu deus UAHEUEHAUHEAUHE
screenjunkies Guilherme briggs fez uma puta dublagem da voz do bane.
screenjunkies Ah pelamor. Eu particularmente gosto mais do the Dark Knight do que do Titanic, mas o James Cameron desenvolveu seus personagens em Titanic em 195 min melhor do que o Nolan fez em uma trilogia. A mesma coisa Coppola e seu godfather. E estou falando isso como um f de Nolan. Meu filme preferido da trilogia do batman do Nolan  o The Dark Knight, mas o roteiro mais bem escrito e enxuto  sem sombra de dvidas o menos adorado: o de Batman Begins.
screenjunkies my cocaine! morri de rir aqui, cara!! hahahahah e respondendo algumas perguntas sobre o batman, eu digo que a resposta  simples:  que ele  O BATMAN! HAHAH
screenjunkies Leslie Manns such a trooper.
screenjunkies I drank to both. crazy night
screenjunkies super cool..i dont always agree with you but its super fun.
screenjunkies Damn i want a t shirt now
screenjunkies You are hairy as fuuuuuucccccckkkkkk
screenjunkies Best movie interview ever?
screenjunkies Leslie Mann seems like she was already drunk. making her way more awesome
screenjunkies Walken is Data, no makeup or contacts.
screenjunkies God, Leslie is such a slut...
screenjunkies 0:25 I cant tell which one is the real Pee Wee Herman
screenjunkies leslie mann is hot. i want to drink with her and then let her wax me.
screenjunkies Damn, Leslie can really put away her booze... Also Hal is like the hairiest person Ive ever seen. Hes like a real life hobbit. Wait, is lord of the rings based on his life?
screenjunkies Im going to name my first born Hal Rudnik
screenjunkies Can you please do The Cabin in the Woods trailer? :)
screenjunkies The great thing about the internet is that all kind of crazies can open a channel and go out and interview celebrities... And I mean this as a compliment.
screenjunkies Chuck Norris for Picard. Or Bruce Willis. :D
screenjunkies Leslie Mann was way too exited this whole time.
screenjunkies gimme a free tshirt !
screenjunkies James woods picard Forest whitakerlaforge Kevin bacondata Djimon Hounsouworf Jeff Bridgesriker Drew BarrymoreBeverly Kyle GallnerWesley
screenjunkies Every character is Eddie Murphy with a Brendan Fraser cameo.
screenjunkies Do 40s really taste that good?
screenjunkies You can sweat dude.....
screenjunkies Jesus was never meant to be funny.
screenjunkies with the current state of the film industry the entire cast might be Nicholas Cage and Tyler Perry. God help us all.
screenjunkies Leslie Mann is way cooler than i wouldve expected hahaha
screenjunkies I love how Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann both had very different reactions to the waxing.
screenjunkies Im never going to shave this leg again. You probably should.
screenjunkies Those three are the best.
screenjunkies Judd Apatow sounds just like Seth Rogan
screenjunkies She way way too eager to wax you. Kinda creepy. You should have a whos hairier contest with Robin Williams.
screenjunkies Dude you are hilarious.
screenjunkies TNG with: Shakira as Deanna Troi (no one understands her anyway) Jim Parsons as Wesley Crusher (he can play a genius and irony never fails with fans) Helen Keller as La Forge (it just makes sense) Nicholas Cages Forhead as Worf The Situation as Riker (Why not?) James McAvoy as Picard (RIGHTFULLY SO) Kate Walsh as Bev Crusher (she knows how to play a doctor and her career is going nowhere anyways) AAAND...... Jennifer Lawrence as Data for her robotic deliveries

screenjunkies Hal Rudnick as Data in TNG reboot
screenjunkies I left a comment. Now do I get a shirt?
screenjunkies What a fantastic interview. You might have noticed how the three of them started off cold and a little annoyed. Most people get bored at press junkets very quickly. But through Rudnicks silly questions and antics you see the three celebrities let their guard down. While drinking and being goofy they reveal much more about themselves than they would have through answering a typical questionnaire. Well done screenjunkies.
screenjunkies youve got sexy legs :D

screenjunkies Leslie Mann is such a fucking alcoholic. Its fucking hilarious.
screenjunkies Thats a guy I would wax myself to. Hal Rudnick
screenjunkies I love how confused his guests are whenever he interviews them.
screenjunkies The main cast of How I Met Your Mother should play every Star Trek role.
screenjunkies This is my 3rd time watching this  I just noticed the toy in your pocket. Hahaha
screenjunkies Amazing, Amazing! Interview!
screenjunkies Sadly your joke characters might be better...
screenjunkies Give me a shirt. right meow.

screenjunkies All these years he couldnt have gone to the gym? Pathetic
screenjunkies Johnny Depp couldnt play any Super Hero
screenjunkies That is so fucking funny
screenjunkies They should make a movie about Tim Burton and have Johnny Depp play Helena Bonham Carter.
screenjunkies Superman.... from now on.... little creepy to me....
screenjunkies Now I want DC to make an Alternate Superman comic where his alter ego is Christopher Dennis XD
screenjunkies He has plenty of weaknesses, Kryptonite is the only famous one.
screenjunkies Superman gets the ladies! XD
screenjunkies Johnny Depp could NOT play Luke Skywalker... unless he used his whiny voice from his early days on 21 Jumpstreet. Then Id just rather see him play Princess Leah.
screenjunkies At this point in his career I think Johnny depp would have a hard time playing Johnny depp
screenjunkies The Grinch, he talks too drunkly
screenjunkies Johnny Depp couldnt play the Terminator.
screenjunkies More Bizarro than Superman :P
screenjunkies SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS SUPERMAN RETURNS

screenjunkies Johnny depp could not play the role of any of the women from the hobbit.
screenjunkies Super man is definitely way different than that one dude.
screenjunkies That got inappropriate really fast. Who knew superman was such a dirty old man
screenjunkies Johnny Depp could never play Michael Clarke Duncans role as John Coffey from The Green Mile.
screenjunkies Superman was a sexless boyscout that didnt exist, this guy gets women throwing themselves at him over just a costume. Do I sense some jellies?
screenjunkies Johnny Deep could not play the role of a black guy thats all SPRAY ON TAN!!!!
screenjunkies Superman is unnaturally creepy.
screenjunkies It was all fine and dandy till 2:25. This is kinda disturbing, was he serious?....I would have left as soon, as soon as this guy got weird, not about that lyfe.
screenjunkies so I thought I was watching a video about the hollywood Superman, and then it turned into two creepy dudes watching nudes
screenjunkies A role he couldnt play? I dont know... Willy Wonka?
screenjunkies Johnny Depp couldnt play Edward Cullen.
screenjunkies Isnt every role johnny depp plays just a modified jack sparrow

screenjunkies Higher standards are not locked to only one culture... This is a humor based show, ...on the Internet, the digital Pandoras Box. If this was too much for you, stick to network television, or books watch?vYBus4gHF1FE.
screenjunkies Having sex in the sky
screenjunkies try to say : a huevo, its very dificult to translate but it means like oh yeah like giving your approvel to something that just happened But at the same its have other meaning, its like you had to do something against your will
screenjunkies Ironically enough, the Jewish elf looks like Sacha Baron Cohen, the ultimate Jew that plays antiSemites.
screenjunkies lol they control the banks? true..story bro
screenjunkies 24 inch pole shoved up your ass. um.. i wonder why?
screenjunkies They arrested Superman for being an illegal alien
screenjunkies Superman got caught by the cops with his dick in a glory hole in the bathroom at LAX.
screenjunkies Somehow I think youll keep responding. As a Hasbarat its your job! Shit I wish my job was so amusing. Orangeman? Youve got me all wrong. I identify with White people before we were ever corrupted by that alien religion from the Middle East called Christianity. You are using the Algiz rune. To say youre a Catholic is laughable. You freaks are all mixedup. Keep trying to blend in though as it is quite funny.
screenjunkies ooohhh that Schindlers List joke swing and a foul ball
screenjunkies Never thought of that. Where IS his green card?
screenjunkies The sandwich making breaks so many jewish rules for eating kosher.
screenjunkies Okay. Im ready to convert now.
screenjunkies Florida. Because Florida is farther north than New York. And New Yorks Jewish population moved north. To Flori... da... I dunno. Sometimes I dont understand satire without a British accent.
screenjunkies like troian bellisario?? (spencer)
screenjunkies Too bad you couldnt get Jerry Lewis to play the dad. :)
screenjunkies Superman was arrested for wearing too much spandex in public
screenjunkies And the Schindlers list joke, so dark but hilarious.
screenjunkies You dont know what youre talking about. My family is from Drishane, Parish of Shull, County Cork on Dunmanus Bay. Im Irish Catholic and youre probably an idiot Orangeman. Theyre all idiots. BTW, know why my user name is ANPGhost? Google ANP and find out.
screenjunkies as i Jew you should have higher standards
screenjunkies Just because you have a YouTube channel entitled American Nazi Party doesnt make you a White Nationalist. I can make up any bullshit channel on this site but its what I say that counts. Any informed White person would never post a comment like your previous one. Youre clearly a Hasbarat troll. Of course you may very well be from Ireland. Jews have made a nest there too, unfortunately.
screenjunkies also, since when do trolls have such perfect grammar? Im dazzled
screenjunkies If your not jewish your not allowed to be offended by a jewish person mocking stereotypes... doesnt make sense.
screenjunkies Not really that funny just ok
screenjunkies I dont get why everyone is bitching about this, they were just having fun...its not like they actuely hate jews.
screenjunkies Sou super f de Jogos Vorazes, algumas coisas eles exageraram mas eu preferi levar tudo na brincadeira do que levar a srio, ento eu ri muitoooo!! Very Fun

screenjunkies Hilrio. S no concordei com o fato de acharem que a Jen no passou emoo como Katniss. Mas, opinio  opinio. Curti!
screenjunkies Achei bastante engraada a parodia e realmente concordo com a parte de faltar cenas importantes do livro, tipo mostrava pelo menos os dos Avoxes, quer dizer eles so de certa forma importantes para a historia.
screenjunkies filha da putisse tributo forever
screenjunkies Isso era pra ser uma brincadeira? Pois achei bem srio, e quis socar a pessoa responsavel por isso :)
screenjunkies Bom, acho que alguns no entenderam The Hunger Games :
screenjunkies Well at least one person did go as someone from the final fantasy franchise and good see some cosplayers out there
screenjunkies I never expected to see Ciel here.
screenjunkies Dat little Yoshi plushie strapped to the guy in the Mario costume. XDAlso I rofled when the Stormtroopers always miss. came up.
screenjunkies Gandalf should have been center. Dumbledore never would have been sacked.
screenjunkies this has gotta be the nerdiest wtf moment on youtube ive seen. stormtroopers only miss if your leia, luke, or han (or a jedi with a lightsabe preprequels)
screenjunkies You missed your chance to use the quote run you fools.
screenjunkies i think you should just call it nerd ball XD
screenjunkies well Ciel was sulking a lot... no Sebastian to play for you?
screenjunkies Im sorry but this could have been awesome but you made it uninteresting. I wasnt feeling it.
screenjunkies OH! Ed from Cowboy Bebop lol hurray. Itd be so awesome if you guys would do an Honest Trailer about an anime.
screenjunkies Was that Andre from blacknerd comedy as Mario
screenjunkies Darth Nihilus is somewhere over there.
screenjunkies Now this is a sport flick that shouldve been seen in theaters.
screenjunkies Fantasy Fantasy Football. Looks like fun. I think the Power Play rule makes this.
screenjunkies Now this is my kind of Fantasy Football! fantasyfootball Fantasy Fantasy Football (with Paul Scheer!)
screenjunkies Flash really let go...
screenjunkies The flash fat, marios black  that asian is hot.
screenjunkies 0:30 I salute the girl who dressed up as Lightning Farron (shes next to The Incredible Hulk). 0:39 is that Axel I see? Even though they lost, the two who dressed like that won in my book!
screenjunkies This video was totally unrealistic... Stormtrooper actually hit shooting
screenjunkies Today, we celebrate our independence day! died laughing!
screenjunkies black mario,twenty sided die? this is epic.
screenjunkies man dumbledore just plain sucks, stab someone in the eye at least you useless bastard
screenjunkies I was expecting football but then you play something which definitely isnt football. Football is a sport where feet actually touch the ball, hence the name.
screenjunkies Is that... Ciel in the background?
screenjunkies Was that Ciel as a girl, the one in the pink dress?
screenjunkies Was the person in the big pink dress a crossdressing Ciel Phantomhive cosplay?
screenjunkies Classic Nick Fury.. lol...But I love Sam
screenjunkies BLACKNERD iS MARIO!!!!
screenjunkies He says theyre celebrating their independence day. This was uploaded on November 28th. I am watching this on July 4th.

screenjunkies I dont get it? Hal rudnick is Awesome!
screenjunkies To all you Hal haters I bet you guys only find poop and pee jokes funny and stay to the happy Madison movies you UN funny jerks
screenjunkies I like the screen junkies show more than honest trailers
screenjunkies I would laugh if the people who have said he is not funny love Adam Sandler films.
screenjunkies Hal Rudnick is a badass
screenjunkies I dont get it why does no one like this guy he seems ok
screenjunkies No, we dont love you.Its actually pretty arrogant to think you know what other people think.

screenjunkies These jokes really are Goering too far.
screenjunkies The dog scene, so funny! And gross, very very gross
screenjunkies Those jokes are not funny Anne Frankly, theyre a little insensitive.
screenjunkies YOU HAVE A DOCTOR WHO PLUSHIE!!! I think its doctor number 9 ?
screenjunkies Yeah, we should stop, youre rich.
screenjunkies Well, I for one think people should stop acknowledging negative comments altogether, let alone making videos dedicated to them in exchange of some quick cash, because that only makes it worse.
screenjunkies Why??? Why did you have to show us that dog thing?? Why????
screenjunkies but seriously his arms are hairy as fuck ... just like mine
screenjunkies Honest Trailer: James Bond.. please
screenjunkies dude hal is the funniest guy ever!!!!

screenjunkies really? he does have a comical head thats for sure.
screenjunkies Please keep telling people how to run their youtube channels, its not like they should be in charge of it because they make all the content or anything... jesus people are lazy and entitled these days.
screenjunkies I actually think hes quite funny, and it takes time to take honest trailers. At the least think of him as a filler. (But I still think these videos are good :D )
screenjunkies HALLO HAL! (You spell hello wrong, it disturbs me.)
screenjunkies What are with these mean jokes? They are like blind jokes, I just dont see the point...
screenjunkies I love this channel and I love the host!

screenjunkies Wow you should do the trailer! haha not seen the film yet but I have heard a lot of people say the same thing.
screenjunkies Do, Pirates of the Caribbean, the whole Franchise in one.
screenjunkies Those girls looked like they were going to die when he said that Robert Patterson (is that how you spell it?) was there.
screenjunkies What a tragic ending. Two of those dads thought they were in the clear and then get roped into going anyways.
screenjunkies This is why my daughter will be delivered in a room full of computer hardware. Im not going to have a weakminded trendfollowing sheep of a girl. I will bring her up in such a way that she will be able to build a computer before she can stand and configure a RAID before she can talk properly, simply for the purpose of preventing her from turning out like these girls.
screenjunkies I feel bad for the dads.
screenjunkies I am ashamed that ik all the answers
screenjunkies Poor dads, forced to go to that premiere. Why Im not having kids.
screenjunkies when they were still upstairs near the end the girl on the left looked like she was gonna slit someones throat 0.0
screenjunkies Sarah looked pissed, when the other 2 got tickets xD
screenjunkies Screen Junkies, could we get a sequel to this with Breaking Bad trivia and the daughters answer?
screenjunkies I would have wet myself laughing if at the end he told them they were fake tickets
screenjunkies The guy acts like an asshole Cant stop laughing
screenjunkies Edward took a deep breath I thought vampires didnt breathe? lololol
screenjunkies Go Captain Kirk!!!!!!!! hahahaha! On another note, is this what the world has come to? Seriously, pitiful. Respect your dads you brats, theyre the ones paying for the books and the movie tickets!
screenjunkies eleven year olds saying to a guy hes so hot is fucking stupid
screenjunkies 5:09...no, sweetie. Just...no, dont do that
screenjunkies I feel really sorry for the children of the girl who wanted to name her daughter Renessme.
screenjunkies My daughter wanted me to take her to one of these films and stand in line with other loser father and their little shts... I just laughed in her face. Ahhh, good times with the family.
screenjunkies What has our world come to. I dont like Twilight, and Im a girl.
screenjunkies Disliked for happy ending.
screenjunkies I do not want to have future daughters like them...I cant even deal with my friends fangirl over 1D.
screenjunkies YAY!!!!! Aww!!! This is sooo precious! 3
screenjunkies Greatest thing to hit YouTube.
screenjunkies that was the worst ending i ever saw
screenjunkies these poor poor little girls
screenjunkies How Did they get the actors to ask questions? O.o
screenjunkies These girls are so spoiled!
screenjunkies I feel ashamed to be the same age and gender as these girls
screenjunkies i was reeeeeaaallly hoping that no one would get to gothe tears would have been able to sustain 300 generations of saltwater fish,and dear GOD would it have been satsifying
screenjunkies Im kinda ashamed to know most of the answers.
screenjunkies These American kids are so annoying! I already want to kill them.
screenjunkies Im so ashamed that I knew some of this answers...
screenjunkies pukingrainbows Anyway, it was really fun . Moar, please!
screenjunkies This is so cruel! I love it!
screenjunkies Some kids just...why do we raise children on such fucking schlock?
screenjunkies i feel bad for their dad :(
screenjunkies can I press like for the epic commercial in the beginning? :D
screenjunkies These girls need to realize that twilight is about a pedophiliac , unhealthy and abusive relationship
screenjunkies actors from twilight helping ask questions for this video that is kinda making fun of twilight? lol
screenjunkies Its always pretty hilarious when super and I mean SUPER fans of something assume that only ignorant fools dont know what they view as common knowledge. No being malicious here REALLY but I legit laugh. I mean if I asked them questions about my MOST GLORIOUS hobby and infinite bottomless pit of time consumption Warhammer 40k, how much would they know? What are 3 methods of highlighting a model? What material should a detail brush be made of? Difference between gloss and matt varnish.EDIT: They are die hard fans yet one apparently doesnt even know their REALLY recent franchises start date. My god.
screenjunkies Im wondering how they got the dads to take part in this? Did they get bribed with free beer in the waiting room or something? Lets face it, these guys did not look like they were doing this for their daughters
screenjunkies Faith in humanity: 50 Total remaining faith in humanity: 1567
screenjunkies The 11 year old shouldnt even of went lol its PG13!
screenjunkies I went to see the first twilight movie with my dad...he end up liking it more than me...thats how bad these movies was!!!FYI,I was 13,I didnt know any better,thats why I paid to see this SHIT!!!!!
screenjunkies And that is the story of why Sarah was brutally murdered that night.
screenjunkies Say: I want a sht! (Really loud)
screenjunkies oh my god I did 58 seconds
screenjunkies Best ending would be  You got Punkd! Haha, still with this ending the dads are the poor ones, cus thy need to with them to premiere.
screenjunkies Please... these kids havnt even read the books. its in the beginning! FUCK U!
screenjunkies Noooo, Its TwiTARDS! D:
screenjunkies Those girls were so pathetic
screenjunkies That Kirk guy mustve been really mad knowing all that succesful guessing did nothkng in the end...
screenjunkies Whoever names there kid renesme I will punch them in the face
screenjunkies Awesome. So happy they all got to go to see the really terrible movie and all their dreams came true.
screenjunkies 0:37 Twilight is my hands down my favorite movie everHer grammar is just as bad as her taste in movies.
screenjunkies The Part Where They said hes so hot just made me gag, and when the 11 year old said that twilight was her favorite movie hands down, just killed me!!! That movie is so stupid! Sorry fans!
screenjunkies Dude these girls are not excited enough!!! Me and over a THOUSAND fans camped out on the streets of LA for 4 days just to stand on the red carpet and these girls just were given tickets to go to the premiere and the AFTERPARTY! They should be sobbing uncontrollably if they are actually real diehard fans!
screenjunkies 8:12 Look at the evils. Hahahahahahaha!
screenjunkies I dont like twilight but i did hope for a happy ending and i got it :)
screenjunkies Thumbs up for a happy ending!!
screenjunkies This is so deliciously evil! I love it! Except if I was doing it, nobody would win. Because nobody should see any of these movies ever.
screenjunkies They need to either do one with 50 shades of Gray, or Dr.Who.
screenjunkies The only actor I was happy to see was Jackson Rathbone. Even Ill admit hes awesome, even if hes in this shit.
screenjunkies to be honest i just watched it because in the honest trailer they said we made an 11 yearold cry oo
screenjunkies my dad actually read twilight
screenjunkies Fell sorry for the dads.
screenjunkies HAHAHAHAHA!!!! This is freaking hilarious. :)
screenjunkies lol this was so funny! I guessed 265 only 6 off not bad not bad, or I guess so sad for actually knowing around about how far in that was....
screenjunkies I knew that they all would win
screenjunkies I came here to see teenager tears full of grief, not freaking joy tears... dam im so lonly tonight
screenjunkies Jesus, these are some of the stupidest fucking girls Ive ever seen or heard.
screenjunkies yeah twilight is fucking dumb but THIS is horribly cynical
screenjunkies I always say it is a must to dislike any twilight video even though they are from ur favorite YouTuber UNLESS their making fun of it
screenjunkies That moment of relief on the other two dads faces when they find out they werent going...LOL
screenjunkies I feel sorry for any future child of a Twilight fanatic because they will most likely be named Renesme or Carlisle or Bella or something like that
screenjunkies What more could you ask for?......Just about anything.
screenjunkies Im wondering how they got the dads to take part in this? Did they get bribed with free beer in the waiting room or something? Lets face it, these guys did not look like they were doing this for their daughters
screenjunkies the loser should be proud.
screenjunkies 11 years old, fine. 13? Sure. 15?? What the duck.
screenjunkies Did anyone else hear victim he said victor?
screenjunkies The Walking Dead  every time a walker is killed xD
screenjunkies 1:34 that was so cute
screenjunkies What kind of audition is this? lmao
screenjunkies halls voice is just shitty. can the guy who does the trailers actually do all this??
screenjunkies damn, that cute and inocent snow white just awakened my darkest fantasies.
screenjunkies Luke dont kiss the girl! Its your sister!
screenjunkies all of these actors were better hayden christiansen....and natalie portmanthough my wife is convinced lucas forced them to act badand omg you made her strip...that was funny
screenjunkies Should have had Jack sparrow finish as Lando
screenjunkies I want that Anchorman poster!
screenjunkies Holy shit, was that the actual guy who played Jack Sparrow?
screenjunkies Mickey says : Search your feelings, you know it to be true. Oh boy. LOL :D
screenjunkies Snow White and Mickey. Still a better love story than Twilight.
screenjunkies I could so see Donald duck voicing a Jawa...
screenjunkies I came up with a drinking game for Ancient Aliens, basically you take a shot every time Ancient Astronaut Theorists is spoken but after the fist five minutes everyone got alcohol poisoning lol
screenjunkies Loved the snow white slave leia part
screenjunkies disney  starwars  mickeymouse  donald  force  sebastian  awesome  youtube
screenjunkies Until now Id never realized Donald speak just like a Jawa.
screenjunkies What do you think the upcoming Disneyproduced Star Wars is going to look like?
screenjunkies Disneys Star Wars Auditions!
screenjunkies Funny. Thought Sebastian was great.Starwars Jennifer Larregui Joanna Santiago
screenjunkies Check out Snow White attempting to wear the Slave Leia outfit the Disney Star Wars Auditions.disneystarwars
screenjunkies LOL.. May the force be with you!
screenjunkies The Farce is Strong in This OneI think Miss Piggy, also Disney now, should audition as Princess Leia. starwars muppets bacon disney
screenjunkies Ha! Brilliant!StarWars  Disney
screenjunkies An even more racist jar jar.
screenjunkies What do you think the upcoming Disneyproduced Star Wars is going to look like?

screenjunkies GEORGE......................................................................................WHY ???
screenjunkies this is hilarious!!!!
screenjunkies sebastian as palpatine. FUCK YES
screenjunkies Luke Dont Kiss the Girl! Its Your Sister! All the auditions are super funny :D ROFL
screenjunkies loved it! laughed so hard! thx
screenjunkies I want to see a wookwok now....
screenjunkies star wars rips are getting old...
screenjunkies Agreed. A generation of girls born from teen pregnancies are gonna perform their first facepalms after hearing that their mothers decided Renesmee. Its like Stephenie Meyer thought Fuck it, lets just combine 2 names and call it a night
screenjunkies Sabastian just made my fucking day LOL
screenjunkies walking dead simple do one shot after they kill a zombie
screenjunkies Game of throne. You do a shot every time they say winter is coming, white walkers, a House saying or every time Geofrey pisses you off.
screenjunkies MICKY: And I slaughtered them like animals! God, I died laughing.
screenjunkies Game of throne. You do a shot every time they say winter is coming, white walkers, a House saying or every time Geofrey pisses you off.
screenjunkies The joke would have been ruined by actually nudity considering the Youtube avg demographic... or thats my guess
screenjunkies wait but mickey is yoda. just look at him move in kingdom hearts
screenjunkies I would pay to watch All 6 Star Wars films as portrayed by Disney characters.
screenjunkies Adventure time drinking game.
screenjunkies I would watch it... but I am pretty sure I am not the only one
screenjunkies New Total Recall, lens flare drinking game. Youll be mashed after 20mins.
screenjunkies Sebastian and eore the Best
screenjunkies I will hate the Shitty CGI than the Prequel
screenjunkies Luke Dont Kiss the Girl! Its Your Sister! K I really think thats wierd!
screenjunkies Goofy should have done the goofy falling call. :P
screenjunkies The loose women drinking game. You take a shot when the loose women bitch and moan about men, which is all of the time!!!!!!
screenjunkies That jack sparrow lookalike looks just like the one from the movies
screenjunkies renesme is a shit name
screenjunkies I still dont understand why people are so pissed about Disney buying the Star Wars franchise. At the very worst, people ignore the new movie...but the chances are, it will be awesome.
screenjunkies in walking dead everytime a gun is shot by the slide doesnt go back...wait....ya you would probably die of alcohol poisoning.
screenjunkies Take a shot everytime there is a gun shot on the walking dead
screenjunkies can you guy make the extended version with the snow white part ?
screenjunkies JACK SPARROW IS AWSOME
screenjunkies I would watch the whole Star Was saga with Sebastian as everyone.
screenjunkies Isnt that how she wrote the entire series? :)
screenjunkies Beat alcoholism with the Two Broke Girls Drinking Game, take a drink every time you laugh
screenjunkies Walking dead drinking game: take a shot every time they waste ammo while they just could have beaten the zombie to death. (honestly how much ammo does rick and co. have?)
screenjunkies What kind of audition is this? You knew what this was.
screenjunkies Kristen Stewart should play Ior if they ever make a live action winnie the pooh movie.
screenjunkies THANK YOU SOMEONE FINALLY AGREES! Just because there was a bunch of different superheroes, doesnt mean its like the BEST MMOOCCIIIVVVEE EEEVVVVVERRR.
screenjunkies Im actually glad theyve taken over the franchise. They usually do well with the companies they buy, like they did with Pixar. At any rate, they cant screw it up any more than Lucas has.
screenjunkies I would have thought Sebastian would play Jar Jar Binks.
screenjunkies Found chef cartman Kyle but not kenny
screenjunkies Darth Vader is Lukes father?!?!?!?! SPOILER ALERT!
screenjunkies Walking dead drinking game: drink everytime the music builds up and zooms in on someones face.
screenjunkies this actually pretty good to watch besides the honest trailer
screenjunkies Prequel fanboys think this is what Disney is actually going to doing. Whatever they do its gonna be better than what Lucas did for the special edition and prequels.
screenjunkies eyor was the perfect obi
screenjunkies fringe: whenever Walter mentions food you take a shot... whenever Walter makes Peter uncomfortable you take two shots... when you dont understand what the hell are they talking about... you take three shots...(thats for when you are drunk and you cure your drunkenness with more alcohol)
screenjunkies The only good film to come out of disney is pirates of the carribian.
screenjunkies Actually the script has solo replying to I love you with I love you too so why are they saying I know?
screenjunkies How can nobody suggest a complete star wars reboot. Sure the original trilogy was good for its time (30yrs ago), but honestly, had the original trilogy been made made now instead of way back then, thered be no big whoop. Way better than some of this crap coming out in theaters but it wouldnt be 110 as sacred as they are now.
screenjunkies am very disapointed no yoda auditions? shame on you shame
screenjunkies Walt Disneys gravesite will be pissed on
screenjunkies 1:55 dolan y u do dis?
screenjunkies Im with ryanrightnow, without honest trailers you would be homeless. Or just have a different job.
screenjunkies 3:30 dont think , just do it  did you switch from jedi to arnold Schwarzenegger there? lol
screenjunkies That was not a prank.That was........ummm...........boring.
screenjunkies Ryanrightnow , highfive
screenjunkies This was hilarious because they probably could have gotten hurt and would have deserved it. Yes they were being dicks running off with stuff and messing with people who were on the phone but hey, its funny to watch.
screenjunkies That wasnt a prank.That was you being dicks.
screenjunkies This isnt pranking.....
screenjunkies Some of this was highly dangerous. In Ky you could have been shot. That being said, some of these people are rageoholics, and need therapy.
screenjunkies You guys actually stole some guys phone whilst one of you held back to try and make sure he didnt chase him? Regardless of whether you gave it back, the poor guy must have been absolutely terrified! This is nothing more than bullying.
screenjunkies I wasnt even paying attention at the beginning, I was too busy looking ant the South Park figures.
screenjunkies You guys are complete losers, that is not a prank, that is harassment. SOOOO unsubscribing.
screenjunkies If someone tried a jedi mind trick on me, I would probably do what they say just in honor of Star Wars, but these guys were jerks.
screenjunkies How is that funny? Thats just being pests and, well, total assholes. Lame.
screenjunkies This is the most boring prank, if I can eve call this like that, what ive ever seen.
screenjunkies you know, your a funny guy but lots of your earlier stuff sucks
screenjunkies Sorry SJ, this just wasnt good. These guys werent funny at all. Even their Jedi impressions sucked.
screenjunkies A jedi would not have pulled a dumb prank like this....
screenjunkies Mitt Romney comment... only the BEST THING EVER!!!!
screenjunkies Use the force on a old Chinese lady, if she speaks english and understands you, she will listen...mwahahhahahha
screenjunkies Those werent even funny pranks. I love pranks, and this made me sad.
screenjunkies The woman probably like shoot I shoulda voted for mitt.
screenjunkies idiots. not funny. just nerds annoying people, they seem autistic.
screenjunkies Some stuff was funny most of it was just stolen from loiter squad.
screenjunkies You will vote for Mitt Romney.... Hilarious!
screenjunkies Buck off Cuz! in the comments!
screenjunkies its actually so cringy that its funny p
screenjunkies Not funny, just aholes trying to be
screenjunkies Hahahah this is the best.
screenjunkies not funny at all,lame lame lame!
screenjunkies say you can replace your liver with iron man
screenjunkies why are there so many douchebags??? Does being a douchebag prove your manliness or something or what?
screenjunkies Some funny bits but a lot of it was just pissing nice people off.
screenjunkies Stop Making these videos
screenjunkies The host is a bitch! He pissed off al of those people and thought it was funny?! These are really the people who make honest trailers?!
screenjunkies On the contrary, people dislike this because they have a good SENSE of humor, as in high quality taste in comedy and do not get a kick out of annoying people. I dont even consider this a type of prank, Its just two goofballs walking up to a person going about their business and says this is not your cellphone and runs away with it. Where is the practical joke in that? If you are amused by this then you have a very very poor taste in comedy.
screenjunkies That was fucking hilarious!
screenjunkies Awesome true Jedi mind trick! for real! :)
screenjunkies This is supposod to be fun???? BOOOOOORING!!!!
screenjunkies Ive liked all theyre videos so far except this one.... this wasnt pranking this was being a public menace which quite frankly they should have been arrested for.
screenjunkies Pranks are supposed to be funny not piss everybody off... douchbags, lame.
screenjunkies its funny when u tell people is a joke and people are all happy but its NOT A PRANK when you go around ruining peoples day and stealing there shit
screenjunkies Stop Making these videos
screenjunkies The host is a bitch! He pissed off al of those people and thought it was funny?! These are really the people who make honest trailers?!
screenjunkies 20 says that chick was a feminist. meets new person first question are you going to vote for Obama?
screenjunkies On the contrary, people dislike this because they have a good SENSE of humor, as in high quality taste in comedy and do not get a kick out of annoying people.

Where is the practical joke in that? If you are amused by this then you have a very very poor taste in comedy.
screenjunkies Hal Rudnick has the uncanny resembles to PeeWee Herman at 4:27... Right?!? Back off Cuz!
screenjunkies Two things. 1. Theyre really ballsy. 2. That brother line cracked me up.
screenjunkies So fucking stupid. Pranks indeed..
screenjunkies That shirtless guy with the guitar is hot xD
screenjunkies this video WOULDA been funny if the guy with the tattoo on his arms that yelled at them actually swung a couple rounds at the douchebags
screenjunkies you will stop making theese videos jokes someome of them are pretty cool i like the honest trailers
screenjunkies Fire the annoying host. Hes terrible.
screenjunkies I want a prize so umm waves hand Give me the prize
screenjunkies This video is fucking hilarious! What are you guys talking about? How often do you get to see people going this far to annoy people? Not that often. So, when someone has risked getting punched in the face for your entertainment, then you fucking appreciate it.
screenjunkies best part of this video is seeing hal with a weird yellow tantint?
screenjunkies these are not the assholes you are looking for
screenjunkies No. fucking with random people is annoying. you can prank people and not annoy or piss them off. this is bottom of the barrel.
screenjunkies I hated Kevin on SourceFed and I hated this video. It was absolutely stupid.
screenjunkies Jedi who steal shit and make people yell
screenjunkies This was the most retarded thing ever. Not cool
screenjunkies You went too overboard.
screenjunkies Im honestly surprised no one punched you. That would have been funny no offense.
screenjunkies Speaks like ScreenJunkies Honest Trailers narrator. These are the guys that make those hilarious Honest Trailers? Seriously?
screenjunkies People need to get a sense of humor
screenjunkies That was just about the lamest pranking I have ever seen. Not funny and just wayyyyy too in your face. Stealing hats, phones and sexual harassment isnt funny. They are actually petty crimes. I dont care if you come back with it later, you and your friend are probably going to get thrown into moving traffic if you try something like that on me. Thats why other pranksters use their friends and setups and just watch peoples reactions. Bleh.
screenjunkies It was funny. Dont be tepid people Reply with disagreement if you are dank grey and moist Kind regards.
screenjunkies Im surprised they didnt get shot XD
screenjunkies Straight up bothering people who dont want to be bothered is not funny
screenjunkies you killed kenny you bastards
screenjunkies No idea how this video ended up with humorless subscribers. This is pretty funny. I mean its really stupid, but the reaction from the people makes it pretty funny. Fking with randoms is funny.
screenjunkies meh, wouldve been funnier if they didnt do all the douchey stuff
screenjunkies You will like this video
screenjunkies This is NOT funny. This is just being a prick and a douchebag. And stealing. And harassment. Stop doing things like this.
screenjunkies By Black you mean no spirit of black people. Lol
screenjunkies Well its a dog and theres a plane...
screenjunkies Its ironic that this youtube video was relatively a waste of time
screenjunkies Its a fing dog you dummies!
screenjunkies That voice is a dog! :P lol
screenjunkies orbs lol cough cough try the reflection from the candles lol the noise who knows
screenjunkies The Incredible Hulk just called me an ass. Haha, really funny!
screenjunkies I believe the voice is saying it wants food.
screenjunkies Dammit Peter Jackson, even two was enough, three was ample but four!?! Ergh
screenjunkies Hello the voice was a freaking dog bark
screenjunkies If this was real................
screenjunkies AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Raz Al Gul XDDDDDDD Fuck you Hal!!! You make me laugh all the video XDDDDDDDDDD
screenjunkies i was laughing so hard at the lights
screenjunkies My latest silliness.... Fun indeed  though I hope they dont take away my authentic medium card over this. hehe! Enjoy life peeps  dont take it tooo serioulsy! Though I do admit, that the real ghosts and spirits at my house were utterly confused by this whole thing! o) But I explained, now they are Screen Junkie fans too!
screenjunkies Holy crap, I just laughed the entire way through this! Also: dude is the worst Michael Jackson lookalike I have ever seen, but he busts out the Harry Belafonte when Beetlejuice is mentioned, so hes forgiven.
screenjunkies I thought it wad michael Jackson crying
screenjunkies ...::out of nowhere::....Beetlejuice..lmao
screenjunkies She was clearly coming on to me, I laughed so hard at that.
screenjunkies BIXBY also whats the name of the last some with the cowbells?
screenjunkies Oh no! Could it be...a dog?
screenjunkies What the fuck was with the Michael Jackson
screenjunkies Im crying onto my meatball sub Im laughing so hard
screenjunkies I love this and it almost sounded like a dog barking
screenjunkies Baron Lam it wasnt just a cat, it was Salem from Sabrina the teenage witch )
screenjunkies Theyre yelling,Hal, youre an ass!
screenjunkies whos the previous person who needed to point out it wasnt real IT WAS JOKE laughing at all the 100s of hours of ghost hunting footage that catches nothing but make hour shows
screenjunkies Its crying ow hot hot
screenjunkies They actually got the ghost of Bill Bixby
screenjunkies You should do a trailer on World War Z...(Do it!!!!!)
screenjunkies Can you please do the Dark Knight Rises. I can imagine how hilarious it will be already.
screenjunkies Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice......
screenjunkies I think it was saying asshole asshole
screenjunkies Now when you say no darks does that mean spirits of black people are gonna come?
screenjunkies Damn, your powers of deduction are simply amazing. Holmes better watch out!
screenjunkies This was pretty damn cool! Funny stuff and an awesome Halloween episode!
screenjunkies Lol that MJ lookalike was really creepy and had a really really giant nose.
screenjunkies its funny that you conjured Bill Bixby, considering in the 1976 he played a spiritualist, in The Great Houdini, that was getting a message from Harry Houdini to give to his wife Bess Houdini.
screenjunkies Funny shit man youre hilarious keep em coming :)
screenjunkies can u do the amazing spiderman
screenjunkies The ghost of annoying little dog!!
screenjunkies Lol that MJ lookalike was really creepy and had a really really giant nose.
screenjunkies its funny that you conjured Bill Bixby, considering in the 1976 he played a spiritualist, in The Great Houdini, that was getting a message from Harry Houdini to give to his wife Bess Houdini.
screenjunkies Cool!! Btw when you say no Darks, tou mean no spirits of black ppl are going to come? hahahahahaha lol that was funny!!
screenjunkies casper...SHOW YOURSELF!!!
screenjunkies Thats not real Oh god, the irony.
screenjunkies Hal looks like a fat iron man
screenjunkies I dont know if summoning Hitlers ghost with Hal Rudnik there would be such a good idea...
screenjunkies no dark spirits like hitler? all people are a mix of good and evil... what a stupid thing to say
screenjunkies HYMSRT? Have you mocked someone ridiculous today?
screenjunkies I think the voice was Lassie calling from the great beyond.
screenjunkies 1:15 Since when is Zach Galifianakis in the Screen Junkies filming crew ? x)
screenjunkies You guys are lucky to do the board thing and not have any bad spirits, its something not to be messed with. Not at all
screenjunkies uh dog and plane or SANTA lololol XD
screenjunkies Ah, come on, I like how he is an ignorant asshole while looking actually interested in what people do and talk...
screenjunkies i agree but can u though i a joker joke about how he wasnt in the movie like he had a cold or something
screenjunkies lol.. obviously is a sound of an animal.. is a cat
screenjunkies Ras Al Ghul... Bane.. Batman.. LOLOLOLOLOL
screenjunkies Casper . . CasPER!! SHOW YOURSELF!!! Hahaha I was dying.
screenjunkies read my mind, shit every subscribers mind
screenjunkies eddie is super creepy
screenjunkies Ghosts exist. Face it.
screenjunkies Hm. You dont say? I hadnt noticed.
screenjunkies do more celebrity ghost hunting
screenjunkies I think they said we love boobs
screenjunkies I think...that the spirits...are requesting a sequel.
screenjunkies This guy is trying too hard to be funny. Stick to Honest Trailers.
screenjunkies this is funny its a nice joke i mean, why would anyone watch ghost shit?its pretty much against my religion, and it was nice to see someone making fun of the morons who believ those hoaxers
screenjunkies The voice is a barking dog and thats aircraft lights (or possibly emergency service lights)... Maybe this should have been an alien video instead. That way, you could say it was a UFO and some form of alien speech or a dog thats been modified.
screenjunkies theyre mice humping in the walls!!
screenjunkies FAT!......FAT!!!......FATTY FAT FAT! Sorry I cant help it Im like Austin powers.....MOLEY MOLEY MOLE.
screenjunkies what the fuck just happend to me?
screenjunkies Why is Honey Boo Boo famous? Ive seen the show and I dont get it, I just dont get it. Whats so great about watching a fat, probably inbred, child being incredibly stupid?
screenjunkies oh man that kid is going to be a nightmare when her 15 mins is up.
screenjunkies 4:03.. What was she doing?
screenjunkies those honey boo boo people are exactly how europeans think all american look like )
screenjunkies Sweetheart, the monsters are on TV again. Should we warn people of their plot to kill and eat the entire human race?No, darling. Just keep stuffing the bunker with food until the last possible minute. Dont go outside.
screenjunkies OMG fat sassy southerners. Whatever shall we do??
screenjunkies I want to beat the fat and stupid off of them so badly...
screenjunkies The pair of them are fucking idiots
screenjunkies seriously. and my country sucks???? FK... that is the most awful reality show I ever seen... Sht,,,,
screenjunkies Please do The Warriors Way!
screenjunkies Were everyday people. Thats actually scarier.
screenjunkies is it ok if i say that i hate this kid
screenjunkies Aww thats cute..... They think theyre people.
screenjunkies that moment when honey boo boo snapped
screenjunkies I hope you burnt that couch!
screenjunkies man, making them read seemed kind of cruel
screenjunkies 4:03 shluckshluckshluck
screenjunkies Honey Boo Boo  her mom respond to Christopher Walken  colleagues reenacting scenes from their show.This is, uh, I dont know what, but its worth watching.
screenjunkies omg, IT can read honeyPOOPOO
screenjunkies Jeezuuz that girl was fucking rude!WHAT A BITCH!
screenjunkies o god can u please kill them even with fire if need be
screenjunkies Oh god no, oh god noooo, no no , no god please no, no no nooooooo!!!!!!
screenjunkies Listning to this made me lose 40 IQ points
screenjunkies Seems like you have been eating to much butterd scetti.
screenjunkies I use to have a hot boss. I miss her :(
screenjunkies Its okay. Us Canadians gave the world Justin Bieber. I think it about evens out, if that helps XD
screenjunkies This is why I i dont watch television anymore.
screenjunkies 4:03 honey boo boo is fappin
screenjunkies thats so sad, hating a small child :(
screenjunkies I hate them so much those fat disgusting pigs
screenjunkies dont forget the tellitubbies and my little ponies friendship is magic
screenjunkies 1:12 seeing Jabba the Hutt and her idiotic sugar fueled imbecile of a daughter make a fool out of herself on national television isnt exactly what you would call everyday people.
screenjunkies As a Walken fan, I found this to be a disgrace to Christopher Walken.
screenjunkies This family is every thing wrong with Americans
screenjunkies dont forget the tellitubbies and my little ponies friendship is magic
screenjunkies 1:12 seeing Jabba the Hutt and her idiotic sugar fueled imbecile of a daughter make a fool out of herself on national television isnt exactly what you would call everyday people.
screenjunkies If a good portion of America were like this family they would have diabetes, heart problems and gout, oh wait.......
screenjunkies This family is every thing wrong with Americans
screenjunkies Her face makes me want to vomit
screenjunkies honey boo boo is a fucking shame to usa
screenjunkies I notice you do not have a winston zeddemore ghostbusters figure!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies You said it, Super Kami Guru.
screenjunkies Oh my god....I actually sat here and thought about how that would work.....gross.
screenjunkies Honey boo boo is so fat
screenjunkies Hurry up and do it already
screenjunkies Honey boo boo is so weird
screenjunkies That child pisses me off
screenjunkies At least theyre happy.
screenjunkies Have not seen a Walken movie? I know you guys are fat... But surely that fat does not block your eyes
screenjunkies Its a shame we allow people like that to breed.
screenjunkies I mean hell, I didnt quite know him, then I suddenly realised I was looking at Max Shreck from Batman. Im a teenager and I know who he is... and she doesnt...
screenjunkies I still have a little nausea because of that Sketti thing... god it seems awful...
screenjunkies I doubt that would be that bad actually... Unless youre a jew, cause that would suck
screenjunkies The mother seems polite and mature, thanking him for having them on the show and listening to his questions, while her daughter was being rather rude and ignorant. I was about to rethink my negative view of them until she made that little outburst at the moment.
screenjunkies LMAO THATS NOT AN ACT . THERE FKING STUPID. And I agree with you.Stupid is Chic in this country. If someone on these hick show showed a trace of intellegence they would burst into flames like a vampire in sun light
screenjunkies id rather go back in time and kill honey boo boo
screenjunkies this was funny as hell in a very wrong way but for the sake of preserving culture Ill thumb it down...
screenjunkies IT BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
screenjunkies Holy fuck. What a terror.
screenjunkies Canada gave us justin bieber. We gave them honey booboo
screenjunkies She said she never seen any material of Christopher Walken ? Good job on living under a rock for last 30 years,
screenjunkies They look so unhealthy and ill.
screenjunkies Id prefer it if they stuck to Walken reading other peoples lines, not the other way around.
screenjunkies We hate them too. Trust me. Between them and jersey shore they give us an awful name.
screenjunkies its people like these that made them WANT to 911 us
screenjunkies she reminds me of the ogres from the hobbit. i could also vividly picture her arguing with herself in the mirror over how to make sghetti n budder until the rising sun turns her to stone.
screenjunkies Not really. Id say the scum of the earth is maybe the guy who kept those woman prisoner in his basement for 10 years? These people are harmless. They take care of their family and if TLC wants to give them a few bucks to be on tv why the hell not?
screenjunkies 4:03 dafuq is she doing?!
screenjunkies Nod, I absolutely had to quit TV though. It made me FEEL stupid to watch commercials. Physically. Ever since switching to Netflix I feel a lot better about things in general and I dont feel the need to buy everything. I really want Game of Thrones on Net though. I keep hearing how awesome it is. Maybe Ill read the books to hold me up.
screenjunkies Ive watched a southpark episode making fun about this thing. At first i thought it was an exaggeration. After i saw this, i couldnt believe it. I bothered to watch another suggested video from the right, and im simply horrified this is an actual thing. How the hell was this allowed to reach the media in any other form other than Social services save problematic child from a disturbed parent?
screenjunkies That Sketti made me nauseous :(
screenjunkies Oh my God Colin needs to be in a comedy his accent is fuckin epic.
screenjunkies So many cool actors linked to Honey Boo Boo? Seriously mate, you could have used them in such a more amusing way.
screenjunkies This is really funny!!
screenjunkies omg!!! Pulp Fiction reference Pretty fking far from it!  Marcellus Wallace
screenjunkies Came here for Christopher Walken reading.Left because of Hal Rudnik. And fucking Sketty.
screenjunkies Seriously lol. What ever Christopher Walken does, gets my attention. Love him..
screenjunkies Its funny because the new voice actor for the honest trailers can do a better christopher walken impersonation that christopher walken can!
screenjunkies Why oh why did I watch the end scene after eating pizza. spews
screenjunkies Honey Boo Boo is he most stupidest load of rubbish, Ive seen for ages.
screenjunkies Man did I feel sorry for Hal at the end of the video.
screenjunkies CHRISTOPHER WALKEN SAYING VAJIGLE JAGGLE! pure internet gold
screenjunkies I dont like you. I dont like your show. .... So yeah.
screenjunkies I am about to throw up!!!!
screenjunkies I LOVE SEVEN PSYCHPATHS Congrats on coming up with the odd idea of having Christopher, Colin, and Sam read Honey Boo Boo..how cool and weird.
screenjunkies The trailer voice sucks ass.
screenjunkies I dont watch Here Comes Honey Boo Boo but Ill watch ChristopherWalken Reads Honey Boo Boo dialogue. This
screenjunkies We are all doomed.(via Amber Thompson )
screenjunkies Christopher Walken, Colin Farrell and Sam Rockwell with a dramatic interpretation of Honey BooBoo
screenjunkies A) Christopher Walken is the greatest actor of all time! B) I CANT BELIEVE DUDE ATE THAT SKETTI!!!
screenjunkies This is pretty funny!
screenjunkies Only Christopher Walken could make this disgusting show the slightest bit interesting!
screenjunkies Christopher Walken Vajiggles. Enough said.http:youtu.beNzIsz3fU9xQ
screenjunkies Makes up for the show being such an atrocity...I still refuse to watch it.
screenjunkies Christopher Walken IS Honey Boo Boo  Sam Rockwell IS Mama Guy IS going for a long lie down...
screenjunkies Not sure if even Christopher Walken could persuade me to watch Honey Boo Boo
screenjunkies Christopher Walken, Colin Farrell  Sam Rockwell reading transcripts from Here Comes Honey Boo Boo? Words do not suffice. crazy sevenpsychopaths christopherwalken colinfarrell samrockwell  honeybooboo
screenjunkies O.M.G.!!!all that Vajiggle Jaggle? ROFLMAO!
screenjunkies Any Honey Boo Boo fans?
screenjunkies The first part of this video with Christopher Walken, Sam Rockwell, and Colin Farrell is absurdist bliss.The second part where the poor guy actually eats sketti? Well... just dont do that, OK? Youll thank me later.via JulianSimpson1 on Twitter
screenjunkies Walken brings a certain panache if you will to the words of Honey Boo Boo.
screenjunkies I went to see Seven Psychopaths Sat. W mom. We both loao. Great movie.
screenjunkies Wait, did the Rapture happen and I missed it?Too early for the Mayan Apocalypse right?I honestly am starting to rethink the wisdom of this living during the end of days. This vid was pretty terrifying.But you have to admit, Walken nailed it.
screenjunkies i love christopher walken. ever since i saw Deer Hunter. swoon
screenjunkies SorryChristopher Walken Reads Honey Boo Boo!
screenjunkies Do NOT watch this if youre high.
screenjunkies Honey Boo Boo is a terrible thing... except when put in the hands of Christopher Walken...
screenjunkies Chris Walken can read anything and everything and make it hypnotic. Even troll comments would be more amusing coming from Chriss mouth.
screenjunkies you look like one huge shitty pussy, you know that?
screenjunkies Christopher Walken Reads Honey Boo Boo!
screenjunkies Christopher Walken Reads Honey Boo Boo!Christopher Walken, Colin Farrell and Sam Rockwell use their dramatic talents to reenact scenes from Americas 1 childbeautypagentcouponqueenskettieatin show, Here comes Honey Boo Boo.Willem Doorman Young Actors Strasberg Brian Timoney Actors Studio Anina Karma Kjeldsen Christopher Walken christopherwalken Honey Boo Boo Honey Boo Boo Child honeybooboo Colin Farrell
screenjunkies Ill take that partial comment and never fear, some Americans still have some sense haha.
screenjunkies Of course we all know who Colin Farrell is! He is the infamous More Cowbell Guy from SNL! Glad to see that he is working with Walken again.
screenjunkies I made this for dinner today, and it really is delicious. Very easy to make and I added grilled chicken and a side of salad. I will be making this more often. Thanks.
screenjunkies uhh, best interview all DECADE!
screenjunkies You need to check your comments as youve already responded to me on this one a couple of weeks ago. I responded to your other response. Cheers.
screenjunkies Grow a sense of humor for fucks sake haha.
screenjunkies Heres a tip: dont eat sketti.
screenjunkies WALKIE WALK BEAR. Omgsh thats so adorable X.
screenjunkies i gagged so hard when he was mixing the butter and ketchup
screenjunkies When he is eating the sketti it looks like hes going to cry. Also I love their faces when he says Honey boo boo
screenjunkies Man, poor Christopher
screenjunkies lol family love...put those people in a cage for two days without food, then lower a double decker in there and see what happens.
screenjunkies Best interviewer ever
screenjunkies You looked like you were in pain when you were eating it :
screenjunkies Not sure if troll... or just never seen the show...
screenjunkies I feel physically ill whenever I see the Sketti, I think Ive discovered my Kryptonite. Blaargghfff.
screenjunkies Nope, it actually seems that I am intellectually superior to you, seeing as how you just insult and ask a rhetorical question without backing it up. Apparently having your own opinions on something isnt the right way to live where you come from. Love and Live on my friend,
screenjunkies I dont know how you didnt vomit, watching you eat it almost made me vomit.
screenjunkies Unsuscribe because of sketti.
screenjunkies I can see your eyes as you are reading those lines on the right side of the camera, maybe if you tried to improvise a little, your show wouldnt suck so much.
screenjunkies RESPECT for being able to eat that piece of shit
screenjunkies Im surprise that christopher walkin didnt walk out..
screenjunkies And a bit more about what is wrong with society. Mother torturing her child hey lets make them famous and support their lifestyle.
screenjunkies One day I heard somebody say Honey Boo Boo is the next Madonna. So then I said No, Honey Boo Boo is the next Zach Galiafanakis... but not as funny.
screenjunkies Christopher you really have to find a write to write a script for you to play Howard Zinn. You would win an oscar for this role.
screenjunkies a heart attack waiting to happen

screenjunkies O filme deveria ter deixado isso claro.
screenjunkies Hahahaha, amei o filme e fodase, no vou matar o cara que fez a brincadeira. Realmente, falaram muita merda sem entender a histria dos personagens e.e Mas danese, o objetivo desse vdeo era comdia e cumpriu muito bem o qu prometeu! Quem vez est de parabns HSUAHSUAHSA J ganhou meu like o
screenjunkies como assim fingem conhecer?
screenjunkies bane gayyy kkkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies hahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhah
screenjunkies Mas o Hulk aprendeu a se controlar do nada.
screenjunkies na boa, avenger foi um lixo de filme
screenjunkies Na verdade Banner j controlava o Hulk  aquela altura, mas o contato com a Jia da Mente da lana de Loki fez com que ele perdesse o controle. Essa jia tambm est na Manopla do infinito de Thanos.
screenjunkies O personagem que aparece nos creditos  o Thanos que  imortal por ter sido amaldioado pela morte. No precisa fingir que conhece, ele  conhecido sim por quem entende de quadrinhos. Ele provavelmente ser o vilo do vingadores 2, ele  to forte que ele alm do hulk nos quadrinhos levanta o martelo do thor na marra.
screenjunkies Quer uma estrelinha agora?
screenjunkies Vai continuar legendando o Honest Trailers? xD
screenjunkies eu so to nerd que eu sabia que aquele era o thanos quando eu assisti no cinema
screenjunkies A cota de super heris do mesmo filme para o Quarteto Fantstico foi preenchida pelo Tocha Amrica
screenjunkies a viuva negra e o arqueiro verde usa fone de ouvido sim , mais o capitao america  tenso heuaheuaheuaeuaehaueuah
screenjunkies Muito bom, rachei aqui. Mas acho que no Hulk deveria ter colocado Eric Bana mesmo, que comeou a nova srie de filmes do Hulk. E foi bem.
screenjunkies Cara voc pode ir legendando todos os trailers do Honest Trailers que vai ficar muito bom , as legendas ficaram legais , bom video !
screenjunkies eu no entendi como o the tesseract cant fight vira  o tesseract no pode ser demitido
screenjunkies mace windu foi o mlhor. kkkkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies Acho que iria trazer muita gente pro canal com o Honest Trailer! xD
screenjunkies mas aquele  thanos todo mundo sabe disso...no ?
screenjunkies , a parte do fone  realmente estranha, mas aposto que s os fs da DC concordam com todo o resto da legenda. Coloca todos da DC numa superviso a suicdio, t loco.
screenjunkies Que isso, adoro o Capito Amrica!
screenjunkies legendo o independence day por favor!
screenjunkies a parte do hulk controlar aconteceu por que ele segurou aquele basto la durante a briga entre os avengers
screenjunkies Eles se comunicam por uma especie de bio chip que fica implantado na orelha, mostrou no marvel agents of shield no episodio 3 ou 4 parece, eles colocam o dedo na orelha para ativar a transmisso.
screenjunkies Pf, faa de Last Airbender, legende ele.
screenjunkies A, cara! Continua legendando os vdeos e postando no seu canal! o
screenjunkies Hahahahahah Starring Mace Windu Mto bom!!!
screenjunkies Eu nunca vi um vdeo to falador de merda..AHEUEAUHHEAUHEAUHEAUHEAUHEAUHEA galera nao sabe a histria de Avengers e quer falar que  tudo do nada, mano.. assim nao da!
screenjunkies kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk incrivel... pensei que s eu tive estas impresses ao assistir os vingadores kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies meio q n o ultimo filme do hulk tem esse negcio de ele controlar a raiva e talz..., mas sei l.
screenjunkies 1:42 Confira de novo!
screenjunkies O hulk pode controla sua raiva por que o banner se transformou e no foi obrigado a se transformar, ficando descontrolado por dio, raiva ou dor intensa (adrenalina sabe). Quem nunca leu hq faz essas perguntas mesmo.
screenjunkies haaaahahaha... verdade! como eles se comunicam? chip implantado nos cabeo? rsrs
screenjunkies Legende o de breaking dawn e harry potter pfvrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
screenjunkies o Hawkeye  o conjutivite sausuahsuahsauhsuahs rii alto
screenjunkies Your hair is awesome.
screenjunkies Caramba, nem me liguei no filme que eles se comunicavam sem fone! xD
screenjunkies Esse negcio do bruce controlar a raiva  escroto msm, primeiro pq o bruce e o hulk no so EXATAMENTE a msma pessoa, eles compartilham o msm corpo( ou )Mas no so a msma pessoa, logo, realmente essa  a coisa que  faz sentido no filme.
screenjunkies Se isso no fizer sua criana interior delirar vc est morto ou  uma garota.....Sou uma garota e delirei com o filme ..... problem? u.ursrs
screenjunkies Gostei da legenda, s tem que tomar um cuidado extra com erros de gramtica comuns, no caso, concertando, o correto seria com s, instantneamente no tem o acento, enfim, coisas bobas. No mais, parabns pelo trabalho.
screenjunkies Como eles se comunicavam sem os fones kkkkkk.
screenjunkies J imaginaram como seria o trailler de Os Vingadores, se ele fosse honesto com a gente?
screenjunkies Im an Albanian and I am upset with you. But hay, I still subscribe and watch your videos.
screenjunkies Not funny. Kinda like the last 20 yrs of SNL. SMH...Jew might be rich but Jew aint funny at all...

screenjunkies That guy looks like Saddam Hussain!
screenjunkies Screen Junkies, please make more of these comedic sketches!
screenjunkies Albanians cant grow beautiful mustaches and good luck
screenjunkies Hilarious! And Hal Rudnick just may have taken my place as dorkiest uncle ever.
screenjunkies They made TAKEN 2 on the logic that the low life russian protitution ring mobster would want to avenge the anonymous death of his son(s) left for dead in the trail of the overskilled godlike pissoff of a father Liam Neison is. I bet the third installement will include the family of the big headed buyer. And guess what http:www.allocine.frfilmfichefilmgencfilm214007.html   Why Liam!?! Why?
screenjunkies Hahahahahahaha this was fuckin hilarious, good work dude :)

screenjunkies This guy needs to be the new host on too much tuna nickkroll toomuchtuna
screenjunkies in Eastern European accent... ha ha
screenjunkies Taken was great but Taken 2 made it feel like just another action movie, and they just showed the same landmark in that movie over and over because it was the only famous one there, they should of picked a better place to shoot the movie.
screenjunkies Screen Junkies, what would we do without you?! XD

screenjunkies Fuck a yooooo! im a mexican  russian  albanion terrorist
screenjunkies The bottles taped to your hands... Freaking hilarious

screenjunkies WTF LOL this is something borat would pull off... Liam Neeson is badass
screenjunkies I laughed so hard at Officer Burke..
screenjunkies honest trailers do a honest trailer on taken!! :D

screenjunkies Jose its SpanishPortuguese name. Albanians have names like Bekim, Agron, Blerim etc.
screenjunkies That dude looks like Saddam
screenjunkies Is that liam McIntyre??
screenjunkies The main guy talking reminds me of Andy from the show Weeds
screenjunkies 324 people are albanian
screenjunkies Im Albanian an i will take you!.... ...nah just joking i will kill you.
screenjunkies Holy shit did he just interview Saddam Hussien?!!!
screenjunkies Umf. That instructor can throw me around :3 Where do I sign up for his class?!?!
screenjunkies Officer Berk is a actor
screenjunkies Hi, I was the instructor. Giggity.
screenjunkies What about how not to get raped by George Lucas?
screenjunkies GOOD LUCK ! lol check the bottom of description
screenjunkies lol the niece is just simply not into it... rolled her eyes.
screenjunkies You rack of disciprine!!!!
screenjunkies I saw this movie... just a few weeks ago... pretty good actually
screenjunkies Oddly enough, I wouldve seen this.
screenjunkies This is pretty hilarious... I hadnt even thought of that connection. lawl.
screenjunkies Richard Steinbicker found this bit of goldness... what if looper was a disney movie from the nineties? coolness
screenjunkies I want to see this one too!
screenjunkies If DISNEY had made the new Joseph GordonLevitt  Bruce Willis movie, LooperDisneys Looper (1994 Trailer)
screenjunkies What if Looper was made in in the 90s with the same actors, but as a family flick?
screenjunkies Disneys Looper (1994 Trailer):Disneys Looper (1994 Trailer)Via Liz Shannon Miller
screenjunkies Excellent! Watched the real Looper the other day, really, really good, now i just gotta find the original on VHS somewhere!loopermovie
screenjunkies I would watch this version of Looper .
screenjunkies Disneys Looper from 1994
screenjunkies I had no idea that was jgl in angels in the outfield!!!! This AND I found out that elijah wood was a kid in back to the future!!! Today is a memorable day.
screenjunkies Hes basically guy who looks too old for his age, so its kind of typecast, hes perfect for the role :D
screenjunkies is it just me or does this seem like the biggest forever alone trailer?
screenjunkies Bet Pedobear and forever alone guy agrees with you completely.
screenjunkies Pedobear has a lot to learn from Bruce Willis ....a lot to learn.
screenjunkies honest trailers, the Bourne Legacy
screenjunkies 0:56 Thats where it originates?!
screenjunkies As fake trailers go,this is right up there with The Shining recut and Scary Mary.
screenjunkies Wonder if they would end this with a blunderbuss to the chest.
screenjunkies Im hoping you have something better in mind than shooting me in the head?
screenjunkies yeah, that was the point of the video. they took clips of Bruce Willis from The Kid and clips of Joseph GordonLevitt from Angels in the Outfield to make a Disney version of Looper
screenjunkies Sometimes your best friend turns out to be you. Forever alone TT
screenjunkies Its mostly taken from the Bruce Willis movie The Kid with Joseph Gordon Levitt footage spliced in. The Kid, wasnt really that good. Maybe It would have been better if Levitt had actually played the younger Bruce Willis.
screenjunkies I cant ever see Bruce Willis as a child. He had the facehairline he has now, since he was a toddler. And Joseph is just too pretty.....of an asian girl.
screenjunkies guys this is fake... they just glued two different movies together to make this trailer... this is actually about The Kid a movie from 2000, you can look the trailer up.
screenjunkies or (SPOILERS) being dead the whole time
screenjunkies 12 monkeys  Bruce Willis goes back in time and sees his younger self Disneys The Kid  Bruce Willis goes back in time and sees his younger self Looper  Bruce Willis goes back in time and sees his younger self WHAT IS IT WITH BRUCE WILLIS STARRING IN MOVIES WHERE HE GOES BACK IN TIME AND MEETS HIMSELF!?!?
screenjunkies lol they made a movie this year called lopper that has the same to people in it
screenjunkies This is from two movies, The Kid (2000) and Angels in the Outfield (1994) My job here is done
screenjunkies does everyone seriously think this is a real trailer? stupid people
screenjunkies What a crazy coincidence, I saw that video too
screenjunkies Great Scot we have to send Bruce Willis of now today to himself in the past!
screenjunkies 12 monkeys  Bruce Willis goes back in time and sees his younger self Disneys The Kid  Bruce Willis goes back in time and sees his younger self Looper  Bruce Willis goes back in time and sees his younger self WHAT IS IT WITH BRUCE WILLIS STARRING IN MOVIES WHERE HE GOES BACK IN TIME AND MEETS HIMSELF!?!?
screenjunkies Well, jovem nerd means young nerd in portuguese, so a portuguese or brazilian dood is fucking with us.
screenjunkies lol they made a movie this year called lopper that has the same to people in it
screenjunkies does everyone seriously think this is a real trailer? stupid people
screenjunkies doesnt the young kid and adult guy try to kill each other? no seriously. its liek hollywood is so bad, they need to recycle EVERYTHING
screenjunkies What a crazy coincidence, I saw that video too
screenjunkies Great Scot we have to send Bruce Willis of now today to himself in the past!
screenjunkies no that was not the kid from 2 and a half men the kid was played by spencer breslin
screenjunkies Turns out your best friends is you. Story of my life.
screenjunkies Well I did not know that so you you dont have to act like a snob.
screenjunkies not sure if its all the footage but most definitely bruce willis part of the scenes were from The Kid and gordonlevitts scenes were from Angels in the Outfield.. its a mash up of the scenes from those 2 movies...
screenjunkies hey hes the guy in 50 days of summer :o he is so hot :3
screenjunkies Im a total idiot, I thought it was real.. :P
screenjunkies Wait a second joseph gordonlevitt was the kid in angels in the outfield???? MIND BLOWN!!!!!!!! THAT WAS MY FAVORITE BASEBALL MOVIE AS A KID!!!!
screenjunkies Its parts of that and Angels in the Outfield.
screenjunkies oh i thought it was the same movie
screenjunkies This is called the kid and its not with JGL
screenjunkies Yes, thats exactly what I said only for all 3 films.
screenjunkies he was talking about the screen junkies channel and screen junkies said on the comments hello Jovem Nerd
screenjunkies make a honest trailer for looper
screenjunkies Say: The Human Centipede: 100 Medically Accurate. Now do the The Human Centipede, parts 1  2.
screenjunkies Why is everybody saying Hello, Jovem Nerd???
screenjunkies I remember this movie
screenjunkies Joseph Gordon was the kid from angels in the outfield, MIND BLOWN!!!
screenjunkies Sometimes your best friend turns out to be you. Thats the message I took away from this.
screenjunkies If you make a film called The Kid and its nothing like as good as Charlie Chaplins, youre asking for trouble.
screenjunkies this should be a top comment. i cant be the only one asking this.
screenjunkies Listen, man. EVERYONE wants to meet Bruce Willis, even Bruce Willis.
screenjunkies It means Young Nerd in english. Is a web site from Brazil about Comics, Movies and other things...
screenjunkies lol you got me there.
screenjunkies The truly sad part, IThis trailer is more interesting than some other, real movies currently out.
screenjunkies Theyre mostly known for encouraging people to go see 300 and scream This is Sparta when Leonidas kicks the messenger on the well. Other moviegoers must have enjoyed it.
screenjunkies Make an honest trailer of mama
screenjunkies well, i disagree with your disagreement. youtube is a harsh world bro
screenjunkies The tone when he talks to the little girl is hilarious!!
screenjunkies I like nonfiction.Whats your favorite movie?Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2. (Because thats definitely not nonfiction)
screenjunkies I just say what needs to be said. I like this guy.
screenjunkies Is anyone else concerned that the little girl was on Craigslist?!
screenjunkies The movie is too easy to pick apart. Theres nothing to really say to defend it except call people who didnt like i haters.
screenjunkies you have to have the right attitude for the avengers. no its the best movie ever. no its not a good movie in the sense of plotstory.but it IS entertaining. and it DOES have a plot, no matter how simple. (unlike transformers).
screenjunkies Maybe you should have interviewed people who could actually come up with some form of intelligent criticism.
screenjunkies OH HEY LITTLE GIRL BROTHERS AND SISTERS FIGHT ALL THE TIME, ARE YOU AN ONLY CHILD?
screenjunkies Anyone notice how the black lady was black widow lololol
screenjunkies i dont like the avengers. these people dont know how to argue their reasons why they didnt like the avengers.
screenjunkies All of them. I hated each one more and more every second.
screenjunkies I think Loki was not a good enough villain for the ALL 5 OF THE AVENGERS to be fighting. The Chitauri were pretty meh, not huge threats. The main fight was all crammed into the end and like I said Loki didnt really stand a chance versus all the Avengers so no real epic moments in the movie I have a feeling these problems will be corrected in Avengers 2 and 3.
screenjunkies Um y is the little girl on Craigs list
screenjunkies ChilisI hated the little girl
screenjunkies i cant belive the little girls comment... Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 really?!?
screenjunkies I JUST CALLED TIME OUT!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies I HATE the little girl. Beverley hills chiuahua is not nonfiction! someone put her in front of a history documentary and tell her now do you like nonfiction, baby breath?
screenjunkies it truley was a pice of shit.
screenjunkies Seriously reading some of the other comments, why the little girl??? she a little girl she wouldnt understand properly, you should be directing it at the fag in the yellow shirt, how fucken dare he!!!!! Complete garbage MAJOR ASSHOLE!!!!! YES I AM A COMIC NERD AND HAVE THE AVENGERS SYMBOL TATTOOED ON MY LEG! IF YOU HAVE NO INTEREST AT ALL  SHUT THE FUCK UP
screenjunkies The little girl said I like nonfiction and than she said I like the Beverley hill chowawaw that is fake fiction people talking dogsAre fake
screenjunkies Are you dead inside?best question ever! Seriously who liked Beverly Hills Chiuaha?
screenjunkies I didnt like The Avengers....
screenjunkies I didnt like the girl
screenjunkies you should have gone to chills
screenjunkies Funny stuff. I think I will like this series.
screenjunkies and like james lee said beverly hills chihuahua 2 is FAKE
screenjunkies I actually didnt like it, the over the top pointless action, the generic plot, weak bad guy, stock aliens and transformer robots just didnt click with me.
screenjunkies I would bet none of those people watched ANY of the movies leading up The Avengers.
screenjunkies Oh sure of course you make the black girl Black Widow
screenjunkies he had chicago 1s on.... Im weird.
screenjunkies The little girl was kind of annoying. She said she doesnt like superheroes cause theyre not real but her favorite movie was about a talking dog.
screenjunkies it is so funny, this show
screenjunkies do a video with watchmojo.com
screenjunkies If my future children dont like the Avengers, Ill ground them, too.
screenjunkies I hated that girl My favorite movies are scifi
screenjunkies I disliked the old lady cause she didnt even know what u were talking about
screenjunkies didnt like the little girl
screenjunkies I hated that annoying little girl
screenjunkies Avengers: The most disappointing movie since The Last Airbender.
screenjunkies Also Loki is thors villion why was he not the one to take him out and marvel ur saying it took five to take down one yet SpiderMan can take down 10 super powerd villons at once? De fuck?!
screenjunkies The Avengers was a terrible movie, but not for the reasons these idiots stated. First, its plot was really simplistic, cheesy and lacked depth and creativity. Its all about the good guys kicking the bad guys ass. Typical super hero bullshit (and dont get me wrong: theres nothing I enjoy more than fantasy, but, you know,GOOD one). Then, one more thing: if Gods are supposed to be immortal, whats the point of even fighting?! Why didnt Loki break that glass when he was captive on the ship or whatever? The entire thing was so stupid and set up for plot convenience. The kind of mindless, poorly written action that appeals to twelve year old boys. If you want real fantasy, watch LotR and if you want real sciencefiction, watch SW. Youre welcome.
screenjunkies I gotta agree with you on hating the Chihuahua Movie girl! When I saw the Chihuahua movie trailer in theaters and rightfully boycotted that movie by not seeing it, and I saved a few million braincells by doing so! Some kids dont have souls! Viva the Avengers!
screenjunkies the Beverly Hills Chihuahua kid because she cant tell the difference between fiction and nonfiction. and Loki and Thor are not blood related because Thor is the son of Odin and Loki is a son of a frost giant my 3 year old cousin even knows that
screenjunkies The fucking little girl
screenjunkies stupid people, this movie is fucking amazing :D
screenjunkies I did not like the girl.
screenjunkies the movie was terrible. should have killed loki, but the writers realized he was the best character
screenjunkies Dear Long haired DOOSH, I wouldnt expect a fuckhead like you to like this movie, you sound like you would rather stick things up your own ass, Only die hard comic book readers should see this movie.
screenjunkies Their brothers there not so post to be fighting I think you have a all girls family
screenjunkies I hate every last one of them. how can you NOT liek the Avengers???!!Its the definition of KICKASS!!!
screenjunkies Not trying to be racist, but that little girl is too young and mexican to be liked.
screenjunkies Iron Man, and will they ever stop making them?
screenjunkies WHat I didnt like was that excessiveness amount of the main song... like the avengers was finally happening and everyone was enjoyed by it. I give a 710 for this movie.
screenjunkies I hated that little girl.
screenjunkies I hate the little kid to
screenjunkies the little girl pissed me off, well honestly the rest of them just didnt know how to argue their points, that also pissed me off but realy the dog movie?
screenjunkies The little girl Nonfiction
screenjunkies Lmfao this guy is a bitch
screenjunkies Heres a reason. Have you ever looked at captain America then thought he was really Captain purter Rico
screenjunkies That little girl. Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2... just... I cant.
screenjunkies The vast majority of people that have problems with Avengers, or did not like it, likely have never seen a comic book before.
screenjunkies I Hated that little girl! :(
screenjunkies i hated that little girl so ignorant
screenjunkies I hate the little girl, and by doing so, I feel horrible.
screenjunkies Loki got one blast from Iron Man and almost shat his pants. This movie needed a real villain not that gay Loki
screenjunkies That little girl is so annoying
screenjunkies Hated all Transformers and Avengers (wont watch the second one). Come at me bro.
screenjunkies Fuck avengers. It sucked. Ironman, and thor are the only people in that hopeless movie that didnt suck huge balls. I cant stand marvel.
screenjunkies I HATE THESE PEOPLE!!
screenjunkies Lol! Ah, I actually did find Avengers pretty boring. Didnt hate it, but didnt fall in love with it either. Phoned in was the best description I heard. Basically I feel like Whedon was overextended on this movie, because it just lacked overall energy and momentum.Warning. Long post:This is just my opinion, natch, but if I could give one example of what just felt lacking and silly in Avengers, it would be the three way with Thor, IM and CA in the woods.Not only did this whole scene feel like a really slow, overacted and syruppy excuse just to say were all cool, guys!, but it had some really silly conceits, like just absorbing a bolt of superlightning from Mjolnir because Energy. 400!!!!That scene bored the hell out of me, but the worst part is that that doesnt distinguish it in any way for me.Basically everything felt very forced and weak. Exposition, plot, characters, even the random music intro for Iron Man. It wasnt particularly exciting in any way for me. And the story was nigh nonexistent. It was just a series of cute little comments with lots of explosions and the requisite drama scenes that were there just to be there.I think people are just a tad romantic when it come to Whedon, because hes acquired some kind of nerd cred. I honestly think the guys overrated (man people are gonna hate me for that), or at least a lot of his stuff is. Really he just capitalises on pretty average  ah, lets say tropes, but since theyre tropes people like, noone notices, or theyre considered whip smart. (Honestly, watch Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and tell me the notgod gods (we get it already, sheesh) and ancient supertechnological sticks of Asgardian heroin made interesting scifi. He basically went out of his way to make sure they were all as boring as possible.)I think Whedons capable of good shows, but I dont think hes the mastermind people take him for.But then, I think Nolans kind of overrated too, so take it as you like. :D(And I still love Firefly.)
screenjunkies I know who else hates the avengers confused Matthew, and he also hated Lion King
screenjunkies Hated the little girl...
screenjunkies These people should not exist
screenjunkies Man no one NEEDS to defend the avengers. Its clearly feckin great. I thought this was an actual discussion but its just this clown projecting his blind geek devotion onto these poor people who obviously arent into marvel at all. What we really need is some actual criticism of this plotless, halfscripted mess of awesome.
screenjunkies I hate the Avengers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies I like nonfictionWhats ur fav movie?Beverly Hills chihuahua 2Thats not nonfiction
screenjunkies Superhero movies are all the same, youre all just special effects junkies.
screenjunkies the little girl... ..
screenjunkies I wen to the movies twice back in 2012 to see the Avengers and feel asleep both times! It was sooooooooooooooooooo boring!
screenjunkies THe little girl says she doesnt like fiction yet her favorite movie is a movie about talking dogs
screenjunkies Its funny how the haters seemed to obviously be people who had no idea what they were watching in the first place XD
screenjunkies That girl was a freaking brat. xD
screenjunkies thats the cool thing abut the avengers or the justice league
screenjunkies Holy shit his face at 0:18 nearly killed me

screenjunkies I would love to see this guy doing more interviews. Hes funny as well as clever.
screenjunkies Its not even half bad!
screenjunkies Actually if you see the other video they put out with the longer interview with him he is cracking up and I think he was just so thrown off by flula as would anyone who has never heard of him.
screenjunkies WHAT? He should have ended with DANCE! :(
screenjunkies HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
screenjunkies chewing gum during an interview... yeah
screenjunkies I think actors promoting their movies must be relieved when a guy like this comes along to break up the monotony of hearing the same questions over and over.
screenjunkies except that it is a german accent
screenjunkies subscribed, man. this channel is awesome
screenjunkies I am watching this movie because of this interview.

screenjunkies Crurp theres one on his channel too
screenjunkies why do i think about tight lederhosen now?!
screenjunkies I want his cat laser eyes shirt.
screenjunkies haha this guy is awesome
screenjunkies i just love how funny Jason Segal finds him to be
screenjunkies WHY IS THIS NOT ON THE FLULA CHANNEL
screenjunkies biggitydiddity I want to chickmcfuckit your chickenmcnugget!
screenjunkies wow that was brutal...now i have a headache
screenjunkies 0:210:31 ahhhhahahaha!
screenjunkies tacticalops89 but i am...
screenjunkies Your brazen sarcasm is nothing but trite shit compared to Tim and Erics humor.
screenjunkies he could be, Eric is an odd individual on his own. Its not like mushrooms suck the personality of the person right out of them, would kind of ruin the point.
screenjunkies Eric needs a shrim bath.
screenjunkies Im 99 sure this is an act..
screenjunkies Xalner is right... My god you people are retards.
screenjunkies Dumb. Chrimbus Special is a SPECIAL and not a movie, and The Comedy only has them in it, its not their movie. The Comedy is not written or directed by them. Also, what the fuck is Millionaire Dollar Movie?
screenjunkies Its scary how well he can pretend to be high on shrooms. Its almost as if... HES DONE THEM BEFORE :O
screenjunkies Oh my god I love this XDDD I love Tim
screenjunkies Im pretty certain they smoke marijuana
screenjunkies loooooooooooooooooooooool
screenjunkies im so badass i do harmless drugs im REAL and also tough
screenjunkies Ive been an enthusiastic mushroom taker for years, I have never seen anyone have a trip like that ...
screenjunkies Look at Tim, he looks just like Matt Moneymaker from Bigfoot Hunters with that mustache!
screenjunkies Who the fuck would spell like you. UR DA ONLEE GAY NIGGA TW0 SPELLZ LIK DAT FAGGOT.
screenjunkies Was expecting like Harry Potter or something. I think those are just normal mushrooms. Sorry guys :
screenjunkies is jason and chase the same person? who is he?
screenjunkies yeah honestly I dont know a thing about taking magic mushrooms and I can tell without trying that its fake. They didnt even try at all.
screenjunkies By bragging so intensely, and attempting to aggressively bash another fellow boomer, you have totally defeated the purpose of taking that journey in the first place. No one gives a shit how many shrooms you have taken. Besides, a quarter is not that hard either.
screenjunkies since when does tripping on shrooms make you a real man. Get outta the kitty pool and move up to bath salts. Eat some faces and shit! Now thats manly.
screenjunkies aberg07 LOL dumbass no u werent
screenjunkies Something I still havent done
screenjunkies did u forget to use a mic?
screenjunkies Here is how you know its fake, never once does Eric say holy shit I think Im on something
screenjunkies You could tell it was a joke because I highly doubt one half of Tim and Eric could crumble into a mess like that over one hit of mushrooms. Still funny though.
screenjunkies i know i didnt sub to this gay shit how did i get here? unsubbed as of now didnt now i was on a gay channel ..my bad
screenjunkies haha these comments make me lol
screenjunkies I love them. Eric is hot...
screenjunkies all commenters before me, who gives a flying fuck?
screenjunkies Eric sounds exactly like the mini golf clown from Happy Gilmore at the end.
screenjunkies My favorite tim in Erik moment is when they roll around in poopy in a child pool full of poop in a childrens pool all the while while singing poop song! Tim in Erik hdicker rule and rock!
screenjunkies I know man. They have child locks on YouTub comments but not an uncle lock..
screenjunkies This is exactly what its like on mushrooms. You get scared easily though and then things become not so fun.
screenjunkies this is fake as shit. Being on shrooms isnt like that.
screenjunkies about an eighth of an ounce
screenjunkies If these guys didnt take mushrooms I would be concerned
screenjunkies Its a joke you silly billy!
screenjunkies most elaborate plan to make when one is tired of getting interviewed
screenjunkies seriously, the intro sounds loud, and then the interview is silent
screenjunkies I love how Tims moustache is beyond irony, beyond being an actual moustache... its sort of on its own. Does anyone know what I mean? Or am I talking balls?
screenjunkies This was actually the worst movie Ive ever seen in my life. Dont waste your time
screenjunkies Erics so cuuuute. Doesnt he melt your hearts?
screenjunkies nothin like a good old spoof n goof
screenjunkies Not even good enough for a poke.
screenjunkies Totes. UR GONNA DIE CLOWN!
screenjunkies Youre a hog. Cahpesh?
screenjunkies sittingwalrusryan its just...i miss my wife.
screenjunkies That was my uncle Buck...sorry DandySteps
screenjunkies All of their one movie?
screenjunkies tacticalops89 GHEHEHE dumbass, THEY are right
screenjunkies 5 buckets of popcorn, and 2 sodas.
screenjunkies Lol, Tim and Eric dont do drugs. Its an act. They frequently lampoon the notion that their comedy routine is inspired by the use of psychoactive drugs in their show. Theyll often say theyre on drugs and demonstrate cliched druginfluenced behavior to an awkward extreme in order to show how silly it is to assume overthetop absurdity must be inspired by drugs.
screenjunkies really? thats kinda epic, but you should try to laugh more. what has caused your lack of laughter im curious
screenjunkies why would you ever make the intro so loud and the interview so quiet
screenjunkies deez niggas is gay im so glad people like you dont get this humor. yes im a comedy elitist
screenjunkies If you take enough LSD or mushrooms you can actually upgrade your consciousnessoperating system (egodeath). But unfortunately it seems it is only possible to upgrade to be a hippy or maybe buddist or theist if youre lucky seems there is no capitalist upgrade the capitalist program is destroyed automatically since it isnt future proof
screenjunkies TheAUBREYURINE Ya blew it.
screenjunkies fuck you with the starwars joke go die from a lack of oxygen
screenjunkies theyre comedians. they improvised that whole thing. stop being a smartass retard and appreciate the awesome of Tim and Eric, great job...
screenjunkies Dude your friend is actually broken
screenjunkies a great spoof and a goof
screenjunkies And now it comes full circle then.
screenjunkies i live in the suburbs and my parents suck
screenjunkies I love their laughs lol
screenjunkies Its fake Im sure, but I have seen someone eat an eighth and act like this.
screenjunkies Thats exactly how you would act if you started tripping after eating your sandwhich. He doesnt know hes on shrooms.
screenjunkies I cant tell if this is a sarcastic statement or if youre a six year old using a voicetotext app
screenjunkies Dem deez dis guiz r faggzzz! This movie is amazing!!!
screenjunkies You should eat more shrooms. Laughter is good for you
screenjunkies O MY GOD THE BROWNIE MOUNTAIN ONE MUST HAVE BEEN SO INTENSE
screenjunkies You are all fucking idiots.
screenjunkies hes not tripping, its a joke dude
screenjunkies He put it in his opium!
screenjunkies Its a funny little gag ya dingus!
screenjunkies Snuggler could snuggle him back to health.
screenjunkies YOURE GONNA DIE CLOWN!!!
screenjunkies Hes good enough for a poke.
screenjunkies How could you miss Wash from firefly I am a leaf on the wind, watch how I... splat.
screenjunkies why would you make a video about peoples last words and then play loud ass music over it?
screenjunkies How can you NOT have Clever girl.?
screenjunkies What was the movie at 2:19?
screenjunkies how about a part two just for Sean Bean
screenjunkies My last words You stay, I go. No following...
screenjunkies The music made it very difficult to hear a lot of the words.
screenjunkies whats the music at 3:03 called?
screenjunkies oldboy? the korean one not the spike lee one
screenjunkies 2:07 The music at this part please?
screenjunkies That was a really well edited mash up, especially the end. Nicely done!
screenjunkies im sorry but your music made half of these shit
screenjunkies Is that the music from the Transformers movie? You know, the part where everybodys favorite character dies?
screenjunkies 0:32 you should have used the japanese. It was a beautiful death. He knew what happened to it.
screenjunkies what are the movies at 2:19 and 3:07?
screenjunkies you forgot the black knigth from the holy grail :
screenjunkies 3:15KHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I know its Spock who says that line. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies OK, that was kind of dumb. I expected more from Screen Junkies.
screenjunkies where was Leonidas from 300?
screenjunkies how did it not have the bladerunner death scene?
screenjunkies Yoda dies?! DDD: Noooooooo
screenjunkies 0:46 what movie is this?
screenjunkies Damn music was too loud!
screenjunkies from which movie was the okay guy in 3:22
screenjunkies Glad to see Heathers death from Heathers. Great movie.
screenjunkies Anyone knows the whole list of movies? Dont recognize some, which means I have movies to see. :D
screenjunkies This video contains content form Walt Disney music company (publishing) and UMG, one or more of whom have blocked it in your country on copyright grounds. FUCK OFF! This should come under fair use you ASSHOLES!
screenjunkies Matt damon gets shot in the head, but there is no bullet hole
screenjunkies and wat movie is 2:42
screenjunkies the music is too loud most times......hummmm.
screenjunkies Is it bad that I IMMEDIATELY recognized the song as Death of Optimus Prime? And I mean immediately.
screenjunkies Is the first song from transformers? Im not shure
screenjunkies Hate it when they mumble and whisper emotional stuff. Seriously guys, we try our best to feel but it sure is hard when we dont understand anything you say!
screenjunkies Start diggin Trout......wheres that at?
screenjunkies the transformers one oh god :(
screenjunkies you should have put in LONG LIVE SACRED GERMANY (colonel Staffenbeurg)from Valkyrie
screenjunkies Ohh, I dont need these Of Mice and Men feels this early in the morning....
screenjunkies PRIME!!!!, i cried like a little bitch when i was a kid
screenjunkies I got a weird feeling inside watching this vid, cant tell what it is.
screenjunkies what did Christian Bale say?
screenjunkies And I get to tend the rabbits!RIP Lennie... The book and the film were awesome. Although the last lines of the book were so important and the film makers left them out... grumble grumble...
screenjunkies You forgot Death scene of Leonidas from 300
screenjunkies You umm.. made the music louder than most the clips. Nice job.
screenjunkies Sorry guys, but the background music is far too loud.  Maybe someone said that already, I didnt want scroll down the latest 5000 comments )
screenjunkies Im surprised I didnt here I dont want to go by David Tennant.Hey,the end of time was considered a movie.

screenjunkies live long and prosper
screenjunkies Wheres Fly You Fools???
screenjunkies Its from a game not a movie but one of my favorite last words was from Big Boss at the end of Metal Gear Solid 4.This is good, isnt it.
screenjunkies This really needs to show the names of the movies. Id love to watch a bunch of them.
screenjunkies Ha, Tommy Wiseau at the end!

screenjunkies What movie is that at 3:22?
screenjunkies TOTAL RECALL :  You can,t shoot me, were married ! BLAM ! Consider that a divorce ! )
screenjunkies the background music is to fking loud
screenjunkies how was sean bean not on here even once. U need to answer me this screen junkies
screenjunkies 1:23WTF is he saying I cant hear him clearly
screenjunkies They should do another one including the following films: Clive Owen in the Bourne Identity, Robert de Niro in Heat, Tom Cruise in Collateral, Leonardo di Caprio in the Departed, Jeremy Renner in The Town, Chow Yun Fat in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Sean Connery in the Untouchables, Rutger Hauer in Blade Runner, Stephen Baldwin in The Usual Suspects, Tom Berenger in Platoon, Alan Tudyk in Serenity. Just a suggestion.
screenjunkies 1:10 best moment of the movie. forgot the rest, except the black cook guy being able to survive.
screenjunkies 10th doctor: I dont wanna go.
screenjunkies the best is dude on the bomb, I would love to go that way. lol your gonna blow up any ways even if you made it a certain distance, why not go on the bomb.
screenjunkies Ha this got blocked!!
screenjunkies No choke it off from Captain Henry Rhodes!!!!
screenjunkies Severus, please and Fly you fools
screenjunkies got a bit sad at the end :(
screenjunkies 3:06 what movie is this?
screenjunkies i think it was the departed but im not fully sure
screenjunkies it was from braveheart
GameSack It really was an impressive port. Only a few effects got toned down. The biggest was when you touch fuzzy and get dizzy.
GameSack thats the most annoying elevator ever! lift going down, 5th floor, door opening
GameSack The woman standing there with a mic in her hand kind of ruins the effect...
GameSack Hahaha, Id love to see more of these!
GameSack Just about pissed myself laughing! Bloody brilliant, I bet Scott murdered Chriss arse!
GameSack I love it when the tables get turned and Chris gets to torment Scott. Scott, is truly embrassed by what Chris is typing, he might mot be able to ever ride in the lifts ever again. There needs to be more of these role reversals, its funny when Chris is the butt monkey, but even better when its Scotts turn.
GameSack Whats the point when you got two idiots in there with you pointing a radio 1 microphone in peoples face?
GameSack HAHA OMG Chris I love you! and congrats Scott for making it through this!
GameSack Everything about this video is the greatest thing Ive ever seen
GameSack Scott  Chris are my favourite people in the world, this is hilar!
GameSack This was really funny, but at the same time, they must have known something was gonna happen with his producer right there with a big microphone saying RADIO 1 on it! Still... love Mills and Stark!
GameSack Hilarious! More of this radio 1! Haha maybe be Starks turn!
GameSack Scott and Chris are the best!
GameSack You must do more of these!!!
GameSack That was so funny. Poor Scott for having to put up with that.
GameSack Lmao was funny but would of been better if a mic and camera werent stuffed in his face!
GameSack Hilarious. Radio 1 please put Scott on the breakfast show permanently! Hes kept me laughing for 10 years and dont worry Im still well within your target audience age )
GameSack hahahahah actual tears at the last one
GameSack I bet half the time they play games in that place. Xxx
GameSack Hahahahaha that was hilarious
GameSack Yet Nick Grimshaw is on in the morning, why ?
GameSack That elevator was freaking annoying.
GameSack Bloody hilarious. I so hope they used it in Newcastle. Best double act since Burt and Ernie!
GameSack omg that was so funny but way too short
GameSack This is amazing hahahah!!
GameSack Chris is the best prankster in Radio 1. I look forward to the day he has his own radio show.
GameSack This is the best thing!
GameSack Love how scott goes proper red lol
GameSack The person with the massive microphone ruined it. So the ppl in the lift were in on it
GameSack I love these two!! They are the best thing on radio, I adore their show, and radio 1 in general
GameSack This is the best thing ever omg
GameSack this how you get siri to talkhttp:www.iclarified.comentryindex.php?enid18835
GameSack Oh, that was class. LOL.
GameSack So good but the lady with the microphone and camera phone in his face ruined it..
GameSack Brilliant, love when Scot gets the short straw!
GameSack this has got to be done again in different situations brilliant
GameSack This was really funny, you should do more of these!!
GameSack This is the reason Scott and Chris should be on breakfast full time. At last a reason to tune in to bbc radio one between 6.3010.00howtocreategoodradio
GameSack Please change the intro its pain to my ears :(
GameSack I was laughing through the whole video
GameSack Ahaa this is fantastic do another with Chris in the lift?
GameSack Please make this a weekly thing.
GameSack Yeah totally not obvious it was being filmed with the lady with a huge microphone just stood there
GameSack Please make more that was to good
GameSack THE LADY IN THE BLACK JACKET THO
GameSack That was amazing but still not as funny as Chris Stark riding the elevator in his boxers
GameSack I bet half the time they play games in that place. Xxx
GameSack Oh say can Yoshiiiii?
GameSack Its just not me. Im fussy about music, so Im not a good guide.
GameSack Btw,you might want to consider getting the Always on Status mod. It displays, hp, hunger, sanity, temperature and naughtiness rating. Quite easy to install now with the steam workshop and its very convenient.
GameSack I think acme made the new music.
GameSack My personal way of dealing with the 1 sack drop is to switch it up to 10. That makes me feel like its rare enough to work for, but not a hopeless drop. The devs made a bunch of LUA code changes so its simpler, I think. If anyone wants to know look for DontStarvedatascriptsprefabskrampus.lua, change krampussack, .01 to krampussack, .1.
GameSack i played the screecher mod for dont starve and i nearly shit myself haha you gotta try it out gm. all you gotta do is click it and itll exit you outta the game and when you next click dont starve itll pull up the screecher and of course whenever your done it gives you an option to go back to regular dont starve.
GameSack It was quite a big problem if you hadnt made preparations beforehand. Especially quite difficult to do in the early game when youre still getting set up and getting the materials you need.
GameSack I made a note of it,  will probably look at mods sometime after Halloween.
GameSack yup pretty much have 7 year olds asking for free hats XD
GameSack The same crap happens in team fortress 2 whiny pricks complain about weapons and then valve nerfs the weapons useless.
GameSack hi man give me the link of the forum where the people wanted to fuck up the blue hound farming I WANT TO CURSE AT THEIR FUCKING MOTHER WHO BORN THEM!!! : THE BIGGEST SHIT WHICH KLEI HAVE EVER MADE!!!::::::::
screenjunkies please do Captain America the Winter Soldier honest trailer!
screenjunkies I have a feeling there were a few more f words in the movie than portrayed in this video.
screenjunkies Whats funny is if they HAD just used the word fuck and nothing else, the video would be longer.
screenjunkies Oh F! So many F words!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Watched this last night, all 4 hours of it. Great movie.
screenjunkies Lots of F words hahahaHey guys! Just started up my YouTube channel about a month ago and it consists of me giving reviews on movies, games, and even talking about some recent movie news. Since it is still fresh, there is not a whole lot up right now, but it is definitely worth checking out!For those who do, thank you so much! It means the world to me listening to me talk about one of the things I truly love. Thank you :)
screenjunkies Oh, ha,ha,ha.Late April Fools jokeGood one.

screenjunkies great way to jog your memory of a film though :)
screenjunkies Please do Captain America: Winter Soldier!!
screenjunkies My children were watching this and were very disturbed. Please put up a warning of the content before you post. Thankyou
screenjunkies SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies I came to hear lods of Fck... when I saw the video was only 2:32 long I knew something was wrong.
screenjunkies To be truthful, the fact of the matter is you could have wasted my time on a much better video sreenjuckies.
screenjunkies Whats amazing is how actually well this video sums up the movie. Fabulous.
screenjunkies Amazing...compressed the whole movie into 2:30... dont need to watch it again now!
screenjunkies This is stupid, dastardly bastards.
screenjunkies I see what you did there, assholes.
screenjunkies I see what you did there!
screenjunkies Very fucking stupid, that was very lame!
screenjunkies i see what you did there
screenjunkies Heeeyyy... you tricked us!
screenjunkies Was I just trolled by Screen Junkies?
screenjunkies This episode was bought to you by the letter F.
screenjunkies Can you say: if you wanna be my lover you gotta get with my friends ??
screenjunkies No fucks were given that day
screenjunkies Say Hodor yourself, Hodor is coming
screenjunkies You could have just counted the actuals fucks in movie because now I dont give a fuck about this video
screenjunkies I think fuck is a F word swell so not so clever after all
screenjunkies couldnt resist not including beni fcking hana could ya
screenjunkies Dissapointing. I wanted to hear the 500 f bombs
screenjunkies And not a fck was given that day
screenjunkies please do Scott Pilgrim vs The World!
screenjunkies So, Fbombs are not allowed, but Fag girls shoes. (1:20) is?Nice, Screen Junkies...
screenjunkies Fword freeforall   :P
screenjunkies CAN YOU DO ON SAVING PRIVATE RYAN

screenjunkies Friends... for 11 seconds
screenjunkies I feel like this wouldve been funny if I wouldve watched the movie.
screenjunkies i think its great that Arnie Grape gets a cameo in this film.
screenjunkies Terminator 2, best film of the century!
screenjunkies Have ur mom watch human centipede 2
screenjunkies starship troopers was my and always will be my guilty pleasure lol!
screenjunkies Dazed n Confused.. Alcohol.. Drugs.. Wooderson.. When Matthew McConaughey was cool AF! You got a joint man..?... Be a lot cooler if you did..! Thats what I like about these high school girls man... I get older.. They stay the same age..! LMAO
screenjunkies HEY! IS THAT THE MOM IN DIARY OF A WIMPY KID?Ehhhhh.... Helen? yeh yeh Helen!
screenjunkies Watch Nymphomaniac with your mom
screenjunkies Dont know if anyone else already put this on their list but Mallrats hands down for me
screenjunkies You should watch with your Mom this movie:A Serbian Film.
screenjunkies i feel the same thing about jenny she was the biggest bitch ever.
screenjunkies Good burger hands down!
screenjunkies The Iron Giant. I love cartoons and its nostalgic as all hell. the 50s atmosphere feels old but not dated. the bad guy isnt necessarily evil so much as getting caught up in his job and hes fun to watch. Hogarth is the perfect representation of a kid and what would happen if he came across a giant robot in that time period. And the animation is stunning.
screenjunkies noooooooooooooooo, Forrest Gump is a great movie.....
screenjunkies my favorite movies from the 90s are Pulp Fiction,Seven,Edward Scissorhands and Silence of the Lambs
screenjunkies they forgot to mentio9n seven in the scroll of the films
screenjunkies For the love of god. Please watch Salo (120 Days of Sodom), A Serbian Film, Antichrist, or August Underground. http:www.complex.compopculture20111010moviesyoucantunsee10
screenjunkies I want to see Hal and his Mom watch Antichrist or the Serbian film. pls and thankyou.
screenjunkies What about some foreign movies, like Snatch, Run Lola Run or Trainspotting?
screenjunkies Terminator 2 or Starship Troopers. I dont know I love them both.
screenjunkies Watch sharknado with yer mam
screenjunkies Watch Were the World Mine or the short Fairies it was based on!
screenjunkies You missed Leon: The Professional. EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies YOU SAY POINT BREAK BUT NO SPEED!!!!!?????!!!!!!
screenjunkies Before Sunrise. Two philosophical college students falling in love while walking around Vienna. Their lives changed forever by one short day together. The fight scenes, choreographed by Then Wooping are the best of the 90s, hands down.
screenjunkies NICK. MAKE YOUR OWN GOD DAMN CHANNEL!!
screenjunkies Fuck the 90s, it sucked!!! Do the 80s!!!! Just joking....Lol
screenjunkies I would have to say True Romance is my favorite 90s movie because it taught me the origins of Sicilians.
screenjunkies They should watch Spank the Monkey together
screenjunkies Im probably gonna get flack for this but THE MUMMY, holyshit I first watched it when I was like 9 and the scene where the guys eyes melt traumatized me for years..
screenjunkies Watch Wolf on Wall Street wyour mom
screenjunkies Im surprised  Terminator 2 is compares with any movie as the best of all time. It was so creative  what a storyline!
screenjunkies Se7en, Trainspotting, Braveheart and of course Thin Red Line. Oh I almost forgot the 12 monkeys. God, what a decade!
screenjunkies You should watch The Nymphomaniac Volumes III with your mom.
screenjunkies Terminator 2: Judgement DayNot only an amazing movie regarding script, acting and special effects, but also for being the exception to the rule that Sequels are never as good as the original. As great as the original Terminator is, part II blew the original in twists, darkness, character development and brought us the T1000. And then they made parts 3 and 4...
screenjunkies I think Terminator 2 is still the best action 90s movie...
screenjunkies I Loved Reservoir Dogs, One of Quentin Tarantino best films. Its a good story line and the suspense in finding out who was the undercover cop in the film, oh and the ending shoot out was crazy too.
screenjunkies What about the crow brandon lee?
screenjunkies Watch Ichi The Killer with your mom.
screenjunkies Blues brothers!!!!!!!!!!!Oh yeah and forrest gump is amazing!
screenjunkies Best 90s movie?The BIG Lebowski, because, thats like, my opinion, man!
screenjunkies watch the room with your mom
screenjunkies You should watch A Serbian Film with your mom. My favorite 90s Movie is Star Wars the phantom menapfffskf, sorry, i just couldnt finish writing it! but seriously, my personal best might be Total Recall. Why? well, i dont know, 3 tits?
screenjunkies Austin powers  the spy who shagged me
screenjunkies Usual Suspects... Lowbudget expectations lead to a huge success... Perfectly written as well.
screenjunkies I dont know if this was made in the 90s, but I like National Treasure.
screenjunkies Natural Born Killers, amazing movie
screenjunkies I dont have a favorite, 90s movie.....they all fu!ing ROCK! Love ur channel!
screenjunkies Terminater 2 judgment day 1991
screenjunkies Dear Hal,I would love to see you and your mom watch something again. I think that you should watch: The Room, an episode of Game of Thrones, Project X, or South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.Thats all. Thanks Hal.JaredP.S. It was weird not seeing Nick Mundy completely rage about something.
screenjunkies Love the Houston Astros hat!
screenjunkies Terminator 2 and to not forget 12 monkeys!! :D
screenjunkies Lets. Talk about 80s genre shall we.
screenjunkies 1) Batman Returns2) Terminator 2
screenjunkies Have your mother watch the wolf of Wall Street. DO IT.
screenjunkies Do the Best 80s movies! I love the 80s! Everybody who loves the 80s start demanding that they do a Best 80s movies episode!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Id Love to tell you my favorite movie...But...The first rule is...I cant talk about it.
screenjunkies The original Boondock Saints
screenjunkies You missed Mrs. Doubtfire, or Matilda, or basically anything with Mara Wilson.
screenjunkies Life is beautiful was fantastic
screenjunkies Oh fuck you fat ass it was a great movie you bitch
screenjunkies Well my number 1 favorite movie of all time is Lon The Professional,I love It cause of Jean Reno and Gary Goldmans performance and its Natalie Portmans first film,i ask people my age (18)if theyve heard of It and Im so disappointed in knowing they havent. Nowadays all these kids care about is if a movie is scary enough for them, they dont care about a good original story,nor even a descent script. All they care about our jump scares. You can tell a lot about people by asking them what their favorite movie is.
screenjunkies Honestly, the best movies mentioned in this review are, well, kind of a sausagefest. No Disney movies mentioned, no romantic comedies mentioned (Pretty Woman!), no romances (no Titanic or Ghost?), no Clueless? Oh, right. Because ladies.
screenjunkies why you didnt mention fighting club?But Im glad that you put the south park movie on the great not mentioned film list at the end
screenjunkies Where the hell did you get this panel??? You mean to tell me that you guys didnt discuss the greatest Scifi  Action movie of ALL TIME???..... TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY!!! What an injustice.
screenjunkies Apollo 13, Toy Story two, and Con Air are my favorite movies ever!!!!!!
screenjunkies The matrix or 5th element
screenjunkies actually had somehow missed the sixth sense being spoiled until this video, dammit!
screenjunkies waynes world best movie ever
screenjunkies Terminator 2 is arguably one of the best sequels ever made.
screenjunkies did he really just say that Forrest Gump is one of the worst movies of all time?
screenjunkies You guys realize you spoiled the 6th Sense on the worst M. Night Shyamalan movie episode.
screenjunkies Clueless and the first Scream
screenjunkies Hate the freaking advertisments on youtube. Worse is sometimes you cannot skip them.
screenjunkies Yes please make an occasional episode with his mom. I would love to see them watch Alien Resurrection or the Evil Dead remake.
screenjunkies Pricks, just saw the list.....
screenjunkies A life less ordinary. Ewan McGregor Cameron Diaz, surprisingly great team
screenjunkies MEMENTO!!! totally made an amazing movie INSIDE the mind someone with short term memory loss by filming everything backwards!! Making the plot twist actually happen in the beginning (technically the end) of the movie.
screenjunkies Watch it with your mom
screenjunkies I personally loved the first gremlins movie, second one not so much but it was alright.

screenjunkies Preach on Nick Mundy!
screenjunkies Not just white people... thank you ahahahahhahaha
screenjunkies The sequel to this episode should be, How to fix a guy that yells to much. Seriously, this guy is yelling like there are other people in the room debating against him... dude relax. (edit) Ok nvm, i just clicked on another video of how to fix, and its just his character.)
screenjunkies Id love to see an origins of Nick Mundy video. I want know how he became the ball of fury he is now.
screenjunkies actually do it pacific rim meets Independance day and jurrasic park for the 4th movie cause IT GOT DINOBOTS
screenjunkies Heres one, make the Transformers the main characters in the Transformers movie.
screenjunkies Make it Pacific Rim meets Independence Day??I dont know about other people, but I thought Independence Day was a horrid movie. Well, maybe not when it was released, but watch it now, its the cheesiest, most nonsensical piece of shit.Ok, bye
screenjunkies Fuck, I wanted to hear about the guy from Jurrasic Park and Will Smith!
screenjunkies I agree what Nick is talking about in transformers shouldnt be a comedic movie that they have to put in a black like stereo type character to make the movie comical and its kinda funny how that transformer robot name is jazz since the genre jazz is music that was made by black people and yet he was the one to die but the movie should be dark, gritty, adultlike, serious tone.
screenjunkies The only thing that should be funny is megatrons sadistic sense of humor. Maybe Starscreams too. They should be like mr blond. A robotic torture scene would be interesting.
screenjunkies Nick munch is my new favorite person!
screenjunkies bury all copies and memory of any of them being made, at Fukushima
screenjunkies Also...DONT GIVE ROBOTS BALLS. Thats lame .
screenjunkies Put in the You Got the Touch song from the original movie and then hit megatron with a freighter! wait, hes dead right? Then, um then make Grimlock pick up the freighter in his mouth and hit the main antagonist with it!... Please?
screenjunkies love your show ) i just subscribe )
screenjunkies Best Way To ReDo Transformers. Make It G1 Acurate And Continue Fakking G1 before It Became Holy Robot Head And Guns Jpanese Shit
screenjunkies Honestly, Id like it if bigname directors (Bay, M. Night, etc.) got some original movie ideas and let some other people direct the movies for the beloved franchises. Because has there been a single good one yet? Transformers, Avatar the Last Airbender, and Im going to just a assume TMNT is not going to be what we want. Let people who grew up with these franchises and have respect for them take control of their future. Thats what the TMNT show on Nick did and its FANTASTIC. People want to see these movies be good, not just the cashgrabs that they are today.
screenjunkies Hate to say this, but i like the 1986 version more than the live action ones.
screenjunkies only robot with personality was the old Blackbird rustbucket guy, and he died..
screenjunkies The best way to do things it to just redo the 80s movie in live action, shot for shot. No one will care whether or not it fits into the continuity. The original really didnt fit into continuity either.
screenjunkies Should do How to Fix: Red Dawn, Robocop, and every 80s movie theyre remaking as PG13
screenjunkies No. whatever: new (read old) sound effects. What the hell was wrong with the original sound effects? In the first scene in the first movie I was so happy when the chopper actually had a cool sound when it transformed. And that was the last time it was ever used.. (spoken in a solemn voice).
screenjunkies god, hel looks so raged about this guy :DD
screenjunkies i like how hes talking about it trying to be funny as he is yelling unnecessarily so he can try to be funny. Psst you are not Chis Farley so dont try.
screenjunkies So no more hot chicks cause i always thought those were great.
screenjunkies anti britishmega nerdangry fat guyhardcore transformers fanplainly ignorantvery annoying guest speaker...
screenjunkies I have to say it, i like that movie had romance, but not force the comedy. And be more visual the action, but trasformers neve will touch pacific rim
screenjunkies I feel like I will allways love Transformers no matter what. I am excited for Transformers 4 because of Mark and FUCKING DINOBOTS!
screenjunkies I say we teach the movie industry a lesson. Everyone just wait for it to come out on Bluray or DVD and rent it from Redbox. They would make a killing and the studio would learn a lesson. Every movie doesnt need action and humor and sadness and a love story and drama. Also, its a movie it doesnt have to be filled from beginning title to end credits with constant talking. Especially if its an action movie. Action, thats all we need, TO SEE!
screenjunkies Thankyou for calling this bs they try to pass off as transformers!still pissed off about jazz
screenjunkies dino bots!!!!!!!!yes they better not fuck it up i agree.
screenjunkies Age of Extinction will hopefully be better as Bay said he realised that these films should be more like the last hour of dark of the moon......... clap clap good job Michael. But then again he admitted revenge of the fallen sucks but probably just to get us to see Dark of the moon
screenjunkies If you guys really complain so much about everything. Why dont you guys try fixing for yourself and make a perfect transformer movie?
screenjunkies TF gonna be fixed when we learn to get organized and not to go to crappy movies.
screenjunkies So, are Mr. Bays films better when you get a staff interview where the expletive deleted was Nick Mundy for the TMNT review?
screenjunkies How about a love story between Transformers and America? They did that already in the first three! Agree about the Dinobots though  wholeheartedly.
screenjunkies This guy is funny as hell and his double chin is awesome.
screenjunkies Haha so funny, great points its so true all transformers movies is the same shit. When i put on a channel and a transformers movies is on i have no idea sometimes witch one it is there all fhen same crap.
screenjunkies if Grimlock doesnt call himself a king. im going to smack a B.
screenjunkies I wanna see what nick mundy thinks of captain america winter soldier
screenjunkies Its funny cause hes fat
screenjunkies im excited but i really hope the dont mess it up as well
screenjunkies I dont know what those words are. LOL
screenjunkies Yeah, visualy Pacific Rim got it right. the fights were spectacular but too few and too far apart in my opinion. the transformers fight scenes are unenjoyable jumpcuts, only watched the first one, didnt waste my time and money on the sequels.
screenjunkies 1st movie was good I saw that 10 time at the cinema, 2nd meh just 2 times the third was a one watch for me so Im not so sure what to expect
screenjunkies Why dont we have Tarantino recreate the Gobots..
screenjunkies It all just breaks my heart. Transformers has to be one of my all time favorite series and all of the live action films for it are just terrible. I have more faith in Transformers: Rescue bots than Bay at this point.When I see TF4 I will do the same thing I did for the last one: turn of my brain as the movie plays, then when its all said and done, rage. I wish I could expect something good or different, but when you look at the previous data, thats just not gonna happen.
screenjunkies What sucks is that they make these idea videos after theyve already finished filming the movie.
screenjunkies Really, random fat guy who yells? Execs who made BILLIONS of dollars on just, 3 movies, are gonna listen to you? Seriously 2.7, once again BILLIONS, of dollars with only 3 movies. You say less funny yet you want a witty main character. You say more action then show less than 10 of the egregious amount of robot fighting porn of the movies. Then use Pacific Rim as an example, the shots are fair mind you, but the fights are dumb. Only one Jaiger has a sword? Its not like guns are the main weapon of these machines, simply punching them in the face is the best move, and yet only one goddamn sword was seen. The sequal better be like hundreds of Jaigers and they all have swords, or hammers, or maces.
screenjunkies Anyone else think Nick is an annoying fat shit who is about as funny as a high speed car crash?
screenjunkies Oh, dont forget: stop making the Transformers BACKGROUND for human actions! Its a TRANSFORMERS movie, for goodness sake!
screenjunkies we havent got a trailer for it yet in britan
screenjunkies They play Linkin Park you dumbass .. its not nickelback!
screenjunkies Why does he love Michael Bay? Guy hasnt done a really good movie since Bad Boys.
screenjunkies you missed something STOP MAKING EVERYONE TANNED AND SWEATY
screenjunkies 1:00 I said the same damn thing to my pal. I dont like it trying to be funny with the transformers! unless its with the cast. and the only funny part with the cast was India the Germans girlfriend.
screenjunkies So funny! JeffGoldblum
screenjunkies The problem with Transformers is Michael Bay. That guy... SUCKS!!!!!!!
screenjunkies How to fix Transformers:Put The Rock in It
screenjunkies Everything he said was right
screenjunkies Nick, you are so fuxking right
screenjunkies I agree with everything they said to fix transformers.
screenjunkies We need a new reboot with another director, I agree with everything in this videoP.s. i hate that Shockwave never transformed and for him to be so feared he got taken out so easily, he only had like 10 minutes of screen play throughout the whole movie and why Cybertron look like a disco waffle ball
screenjunkies How to fix Jurassic Park, please. Also, How to fix Star Wars and how to fix Indiana Jones. Thank you.
screenjunkies They better not F this up
screenjunkies Megan foxes ass was worth the entry
screenjunkies im english and think its entirely possible that we wiuld be corrupted by decepticon technology :L hahahaha
screenjunkies So true, but Transformers is boss, but theres too much cursing in the 2nd one. My favorite is the 3rd one and my second is the 1st one.
screenjunkies How to fix transformers? Dont make a transformers movie!
screenjunkies Pacific Rim tried to be Independence Day and it didnt work, other than that I agree for the most part!
screenjunkies Heres an easy solution. Instead of wasting money at the theater, and praying for a miracle, just stay home and play the Transformers: Cybertron games. Even if youve played them 100 times, it will still be a more worthwhile experience than watching Bays Robot Circus again.
screenjunkies Do a How to fix AlienPrometheus
screenjunkies You mean Linkin park not Nickel back.What Ive done,New divide and Iridescent appeared in Transformers and the subsequent films Revenge of the Fallen and  Dark of the moon respectively.
screenjunkies we need unicron and Hot Rod
screenjunkies never bothered to watch any transformer Micheal Bay films, am a fan of the animated series n anything referenced on robot chicken. however now transformers is like xbox, alot of people want it....but only half are smart enough to say hell no to that stinking garbabe in the first place. FYI always have been a playstation gamer :)Also Nick Mundy you are the goose that lays the golden egg, you lovable thing you! keep up the good work, of strokes and rudeness. Your my idle, keep on raging. against the machine?
screenjunkies Being British.. I must say I found that comment... actually really funny. I would love to see Optimus rip Big Ben right out of the ground too. XD
screenjunkies I agree, the Humorous Scenes just make it super awkward. I mean, WE CAME TO SEE ROBOTS BEATING THE SHT OUT OF EACH OTHER NOT THE MAIN CHARACTER HAVING A FUNNY SPASM THING!!!
screenjunkies The answer is simple: let Guillermo del Toro direct transformers.
screenjunkies my advice. Dump all humans from the script. This is a TRANSFORMERS movie, in it humans dont deserve storylines, they dont deserve spotlight ... Cameos are good enoth for them!I dont care about that chop shop bostan dad and i bet he is gona be in 50 of the screentime. Ok no problem i can take that crap, but it have to have at least 90 screentime with actual Transformers taking part of the scene, that are not just siting around for decoration.In the end Transformers is about one race of alliens fighting some other race of aliens, and as a coincidence thats taking place around and on Earth.
screenjunkies 6:40 There i just saved you some time....I recommend watching the whole video though lol
screenjunkies Nick mundy is the man !!!!
screenjunkies Theyre still fucking making bayformers movies? And now theyre going to ruin dinobots as well? And people are still WATCHING them?Well, I guess if the best suggestion for improving them is make it like pacific shit but if it was made by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich then it pretty clearly illustrates what kind of an audience those things have.
screenjunkies michael tnt bay has proven he cant make a good live action transformers movie. The robots look like shit. The plots are silly. Most of all the human characters ALL suck. What the fuck happened to energon cubes? Do have to be a an ass licking mason to enjoy them chasing after a mystical cube in part 1?! Why did megatron have to get frozen on earth like jetfire? Why does starscream look like an angry slice of pizza? Why does bumble bee seem a bit much like wreck gar? Wanting to see shia la douche die in this series, was just as bad enough a guilty pleasure as wanting to see john cusack die a horrific death in 2012. The best way to unfuck live action transformers movies is to base them on the idw comic or the war for cybertron games, and have James Cameron or Peter Jackson make them.
screenjunkies Arlington Road is such an underrated movie. Tim Robbins is absolutely terrifying.
screenjunkies i was watching chinatown.. and for somereason i started whatching this clip.. i paused right away :
screenjunkies its a new movie but I would have put the worlds end in here for some humor, I saw it without knowing anything of the premise and I literally stared at the screen for 5 minutes thinking I was hallucinating something
screenjunkies The Mists ending was the biggest F You to audiences in movie history. Great movie, but still...
screenjunkies The ending of The Mist is surprisingly meaningful, given that the movie sucks for most parts.
screenjunkies The Prestige and Minority Report, theyre ones I also would have liked to see here.But this was actually a really good idea for a supercut. Well done.
screenjunkies Whenever I hear Whats in the box? I think of the box from SNL.
screenjunkies Yeah uh... Im gonna stop watching now... I thought I had seen all the movies on here... NO... Dammit...
screenjunkies The Mist breaks my heart every time. :( Also why use the remake of Wicker Man? Original is much, much better.
screenjunkies Is The Game a good movie?
screenjunkies Bad ass montage. Bravo, Screen Junkies!
screenjunkies What is the movie at 2:26?
screenjunkies I think if Planet of the Apes really happened, whoever would be left would play the situation in an ironic way.
screenjunkies Plot twist Kevin Spacey is in all of them.
screenjunkies can someone please tell me names of all the movies?
screenjunkies The Game had one too many twists at the end....... IMO
screenjunkies Anyone know what the music is??
screenjunkies What a twist!!...now which of these Honest Trailers have I not seen yet...?

screenjunkies what about iron man 3

screenjunkies Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) ending still freaks me out.
screenjunkies Theres a sevear lack of Unbreakable in this montage.They called me Mr. Glass
screenjunkies This video is pure evil! Awesome :)
screenjunkies Wow ya this is awesome
screenjunkies Cool, the first supercut I actually enjoyed
screenjunkies Memento? Psh, the whole movie was basically one big twist. And why include the 2006 version of the Wicker Man?
screenjunkies Unbreakable had a pretty decent twist and in my opinion is Shamalamadingdongs finest film.
screenjunkies Whats the name of the song ?
screenjunkies Darth Vader was Luke father? wtf
screenjunkies What a twist!! in the comments below!!
screenjunkies say: Im not a pervert, Im a PROvert Im good at what I do
screenjunkies I have seen all this movies haha
screenjunkies what is that film with mel gibson?
screenjunkies do the simpsons honest trailers
screenjunkies At 1:14 there is clearly no gunshot wound on Matt Damons face.
screenjunkies didnt actually give away Se7en completely
screenjunkies Luckily i only havnt seen The crying game and Chinatown so i am not that spoiled.Three other movies if you could have put in something like this are, the good the bad and the ugly, Fallen and american beauty
screenjunkies Arlington Road,the movie that made me even more paranoid about people than I already was,still is one of my all time favourites
screenjunkies 1:53 I havent seen that film, but from that short glimpse, i thought that was James Purefoy in the car, its Thomas Jane, they could easily fit a brothers type of role, eh?
screenjunkies glad ive seen it all spoil 1001 movies must watch before you die on youtube then im impress
screenjunkies What a twist!! Too bad Ive never seen any of these movies ever.
screenjunkies what movie was that one with Jhon Cussack looking in the mirror at some bald dude?Also, King Jofry got poisoned and died in last episode of Game of Thrones.
screenjunkies RIP Dany and Arya Stark Season 4 Ep. 9
screenjunkies 3:10 he is a bastard though?
screenjunkies stop with the spoilers u dicks
screenjunkies Daenarys dies. Dont want to hear you guys crying when it happens. Shes a bad character anyway.
screenjunkies Anything with Arya Stark and the Hound (They are the Game of Thrones Big Daddy and Kickass Girl) ... And, Daenarys with her Dragons...
screenjunkies That fuing Argus Filch!
screenjunkies Not even a mention to lord Baelish? Hes like the most badass motherfucker in the show!
screenjunkies Red wedding was my favorite part!
screenjunkies By FAR its Tyrion bitch slapping the little bitch Geoffrey.
screenjunkies SHES GOT A GUY STUCK IN THE FRIEND ZONE HAHAHA and I hate John snow, cuz.,.... he knows nothing
screenjunkies A very special episode? lol!
screenjunkies Am I the only one who likes Brans plot line
screenjunkies I wanted Joffery to win at the end. I wanted him to get the throne.What, this offends some fans?You know what I have to say to say to you sniveling bastards? Go suck on Theon Greyjoys dick.
screenjunkies Half of those you mentioned to be still alive are probably dead in the upcoming book already.
screenjunkies Brans story line is pretty key later on in the books. Do NOT fastforward those parts, yes, its not as exciting as dragons and unexpected deaths, but just wait, Brans abilities kick butt.
screenjunkies I know I might get a bit of hate but I really think Danerys would be a shit queen. She doesnt know shit about leading a kingdom. In reality, I think Tywin should be king. Hes the most capable one. Cruel, but capable. Even he thought that Joffrey was a shit
screenjunkies Actually, Joffrey is a bastard.His parents are Jaime and Cersei, and theyre not married so that makes him a bastard.
screenjunkies I personally like storyline with Bran, lol
screenjunkies He didt cut his dick, but his balls.
screenjunkies do the books have a main charachter?
screenjunkies Episode 9.. That was totally heart stabbing. All people that I thought was the main character is dead shhh, now I just hope that George RRM wont kill Arya. And I havent seen Season 4 yet.
screenjunkies just thought id point that you were right the first time, Joffrey technically IS a pure wee BASTARD! illegitimate son born out of incest remember? totally diggin ur vids btw, ur a pretty weird dude, but i get u! LOVED the awkward Anchorman Interview eh
screenjunkies why is there a doll of Kanye West in the top left corner
screenjunkies I thought that joffrey was a bastard because his mom had him with her brother or something like that. But then again this shit is confusing
screenjunkies do this for the walking dead season 4
screenjunkies But Joffrey IS a bastard though.... his real parents are jaime and cersei
screenjunkies Season 4 is going to be the best season so far, its already got the strongest start, and you just wait to see all the rest that happens...
screenjunkies When Jon Snow is boning Ygritte and shes gonna drop another You know nothing Jon Snow but cuts off in a moment of pure ecstasy.
screenjunkies DO THE PAGEMASTER!!!!!!
screenjunkies I remember the fuckin aggro crag... damn it.
screenjunkies my favourite? All scenes with the mother of the dragons, especially those where she was in the nude, stepping out of her bathtub and stuff like that ... love her! ()
screenjunkies 04:13 slays me every time.
screenjunkies My favorite moment in season 3:Tyrions and Sansas wedding. Tyrion basically tells her this shit sucks, so we might as well get it over with and get drunk so that we dont remember it. But even being shitfaced out of his mind, he tells Sansa no and literally tells Tywin to go fuck himself.
screenjunkies Favorite scene is when Kaleesi reveal that she could understand every word the king was saying . Such a bad ass woman!
screenjunkies the dick in a box is one of my favorite parts
screenjunkies I know were only on episode three of season 4 but , i know my favorite episode already
screenjunkies LOVE the red wedding so fing nice
screenjunkies Say, winter is coming.
screenjunkies Joffery actually is a literal bastard.....right?
screenjunkies dude your awesome, best round up of this show.
screenjunkies Geoffrey is a bastard. his parents were not married. :)
screenjunkies at the minute bran is boring bit they need to show what happens with him as his charactet has a vital role later on. it was bittersweet when joff killed ros, her character was boring but super hot. but the best part is EVERYTHING BRONN SAYS
screenjunkies Tyrion King Slapper is totally my favorite! :D
screenjunkies The Red Wedding was awesome.
screenjunkies Not watching it was my favorite part of season 3
screenjunkies hahah thats what i always do i skip all the plot with bran and his bullshit
screenjunkies you look like that comic bookshop guy from Big Bang Theory
screenjunkies The dynamic between Brienne of Tarth and Jaime Lannister, during season 3, really worked for me. They came together out of practicality, but do watch out for each other out of some level of human compassion... something especially not generally observed in Jaime. They still have no hesitation to snipe at each other and hold different values, but Brienne managed to bring out in the kinkillingchildkilling Jaime an unprecedented sense of compassion for someone other than himself and Cirsei. That it was never a romance between the two made it all the more awesome.
screenjunkies my fav part was when Tyrion moved the chair in the meetingcool to see a clever gag than just constant exposition
screenjunkies I like this guy, hes like Andy Dick, but worse.
screenjunkies Dude got his dick cut? He must e getting PAID!!!!!
screenjunkies Never watched game of thrones but now I gotta start watching it.
screenjunkies OK HAL RUDNICK I DONT UNDERSTAND A FUK OF WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, YOUR (the idiots guide to game of thrones season 12 didnt help a FUCK!!!) AND THIS ONE ITS A LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT...1WHAT DO YOU MAN THAT JOHN SNOW ITS A BASTARD? 2 WHO ARE THE WILDWINGS? OR WHATEVER. 3 WHO IS THAT GIRL WHIT BALCK THEET OR WHAT IS IT? 4 WHO IS THE HOUND? 5 WHY THERANIOUS JONH AND ARIA ARE OUR ONLY HOPE???????? YOU DONT EXPLAIN ANYTHING!!!! (AND NO, SEASONS 1 AND 2 DOSENT EXPLAINED)MAKE A BETTER IDIOTS GUIDE!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Not a fan of Daenerys but JorahBarristan are like the coolest guys in the show. I got the first 3 seasons on DVD box and could watch them all in the tempo i prefered. Now that i have to watch 1 episode per week its feel like everything in the show is going so damn slow.
screenjunkies All the Stark children are skinchangers, except Lady already died in season 1 and Robb is...well you know.
screenjunkies Watch for the comment section.For the web is dark and full of spoilers. Youve been warned.
screenjunkies Ow my favourite part of season 3 is NONE OF IT BECAUSE GAME OF THRONES IS SHIT there is too much crap going on, my idiotic human brain cant keep track and the only reason I watched this video was because I thought Id give game of thrones another chance but it only confirmed for me that game of thrones IS SHIT and so is walking dead
screenjunkies The reeds are one of the houses of the north.
screenjunkies the best part: Arya and the faceless man
screenjunkies You skipped all of Brans stuff? His stuff is actually very important... soon. Soon.
screenjunkies joffrey is a bastard. like in the literal sensealso i dont like the way you were talking about daenerysps you cant pronounce any names
screenjunkies Daenerys should get in touch with Oberyn Martell. Theyre in laws (His sister Elia married her older brother Rhaegar)and he hates the Lanisters!!!
screenjunkies Tyrion Lannister For King. Best Story Arya Stark Hope she kills all of them. Best action big time win for me and hottest of all the boobs Daenerys Targaryen
screenjunkies Best moment: Tyrion drags his chair in the town hall.
screenjunkies Get itSorry spelling error joffrey
screenjunkies you guys are gonna be so pissed at Dany this season, lol your lucky you didnt have to suffer through what her self doubts for hundreds of pages at least. also this isnt a spoiler im just lowering your expectations.
screenjunkies the red wedding huh i felt bad after that
screenjunkies King Joffery is a literal bastard BTW, as he is product of incest.
screenjunkies Geoffrey is an actual bastard.
screenjunkies Im looking forward to Joffrey getting poisoned to death.
screenjunkies my favorite part is when Khaleesi gets the army and speaks valeryan to te bald guy and kills them all aaahhh could watch that a thousand times over
screenjunkies I want deanerys to win the throne
screenjunkies Actually Joffrey is a bastard.
screenjunkies Am i the only one who likes lil bran? I havent read the books but i would imagine his story becomes important in the battle against the white walkers
screenjunkies The way I see it, Bran becomes everybodys best hope. Arya becomes even more badass, but I have a feeling she will wreck the wrong shit and fuck up everything for everybody. Just a hunch though.
screenjunkies WAR FOR BREAKFASt!!!!
screenjunkies You know nothin Jon snow
screenjunkies My favorite part was when Khaleese was all like: Drakaris. And the dragon was all like DIS DOOD IS ON FIREEEEEE
screenjunkies But .....I like Brans slowly, slowly progressing storyline.  Minority
screenjunkies I just got an ad for Martell cognac...lol
screenjunkies The best Scene?I just say one word DRACARYS! is the more to say I guess not still get a gooseflesh...oh and a climax )
screenjunkies Dont watch the coments, they are only spoilers.
screenjunkies Whatever happened to Gendry? So Davos just let him leave Dragonstone and now hes just not gonna be in Season 4 at all? Hes not even dead yet! What happens???
screenjunkies ERIC YOUNG IS WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION!
screenjunkies Lord Friendzone, hahahaha
screenjunkies Know all the characters that it said no one knew
screenjunkies Boobs and swords... swords and boobs... heads roll...
screenjunkies Boobs :) and Margery od super hooot. Im proude of my self knowing all of the names (it od easier if you read the books )
screenjunkies Is it just me or does this guy sound and talk like Duke Nukem.
screenjunkies i like how you say boobs
screenjunkies One and only fail about this tv show : Emilia Clarke

screenjunkies WTF is with these random ass nouns that describe people
screenjunkies Why is the resolution only 240p?
screenjunkies TOO. MUCH. CGI. Holy shit. The reason the live action movies were so fun was because of the fight choreography that was done in the suits. The one guy says that itll be a more interesting Transformers movie because of the personalities. CGI characters always have less personality. Itll rake it some cash but Im afraid it wont have the longevity that some of us had hoped for.
screenjunkies The Turtles dont look like Turtles, they look like some sort of Turtle human half breed... with lips
screenjunkies It looks awful!...and i think thats the way i like it. This is what i thought about Transformers too back then when i first saw its Teasers.
screenjunkies to be honest, the little bit with Mike saying its only a mask sold me completelly, hes my favorite turtle by far and i feel like they got it right when it comes to personality.i dont care about the origin story, just because a new movie comes out doesnt mean the old ones disappear, nor do the cartoons, comics and toys, enjoy things for what they are and not for what they might been. if kids gets into the turtles because of this and we see them everywhere again, ill be happy even if the movie is super shitty, that being said the trailer made it look like a lot of fun so ill go watch it for sure.
screenjunkies They must of payed yall a cool million to lie on camera like this...this movie is gonna SUUUUUUUUCK!
screenjunkies Im sort of optimistic. I think Michael Bay is far enough away from the film that it wont just be an awful clusterfuck of explosions and CGI, but actually have a little personality to it.
screenjunkies 4:14 Hal looks like german propaganda
screenjunkies I will admit I am not the best one to judge because although i did watch the original cartoon show. I wasnt a fan boy about it but let me express how I feel about a White Shredder.....Sure, shredder is suppose to Asian BUT....Lets face facts when you think of shredder, your not thinking ethnicity, your not thinking of his real name. All your thinking about is that bad ass costume and im sure for when the fight scenes with him happen they will have an actual fighter in the suit doing all the stunts. So lets see how they fill it.
screenjunkies Michael Bay isnt directing! Hes producing it! Therefore it might not be that shit!
screenjunkies I have many problems about the new TMNT movie, for starters i wouldve loved if the movie was inspred by the new Nickelodeons TMNT cartoon, that cartoon has an awesome backstory for the turtles, it has the best chreder and master splitner ever made, adn also has the Turtles finally acting as teenagers, for the first time ever the turtles feel like unexperience teenagers who always are learning new lessons about life, and they have PERSONALITY, real personality, unique personality, but no the director of this new movie decided to fuck all that awesmoe work and do an extremly boring backstory
screenjunkies Id shut up and see the movie first really.
screenjunkies So Shredder is old as fuck, the turtles look hideous, and were supposed to be excited for this, because... its Michael Bay? Gives look of disappointed parent
screenjunkies Wow, and I tought I was fat. But damn that black is fat!!
screenjunkies Americans dont even give stuff a chance before they start running their dam mouths. Everybody is saying its going to be bad like they can see into the dam future. How about u lazy opinionated fucks get off your couch and go try to create something better sheesh
screenjunkies its gonna be bad.. really bad. i mean, an old white guy is gonna juice up and be shredder.. remind you of anyone? ... the horrible green goblin from spider man (2002)id think everyone knows by now that only one or two good movies come out per year.. and those are rarely action movies
screenjunkies i automatically hate it because michael bay throughout his entire career as a filmmaker he has only made one good movie and that was armageddon which the soundtrack for was shit
screenjunkies Im sorry but Im getting sick of them making remakes of my childhood favorites with fuxking CGI. If they didnt heavyily use that I would be fine with a remake.
screenjunkies Honest Trailers are great!!!
screenjunkies I dont see how this movie will mess up the franchise, because this is as close to real mutated turtles would look like. in past movies they looked more like oversized frogs, than turtles. the only thing that I dont like is that Shredder is some white guyscientist (no offense) smh. should have kept him asian.
screenjunkies sooo dose this man Michael (explosions) bay has retracted his idea of referring to the turtles as aliens? also whys Megan fox in this movie is she April. whats next shia labeouf as Casey.... :( oh no I said to much
screenjunkies Megan Fox...Please....get away from my childhood.....
screenjunkies Michelangelo looks like Shrek lol.
screenjunkies When I first saw the trailer I thought through its intro, Is this The Dark Knight? This movie looks pretty bad. I mean just look at the Turtles faces their so ugly!
screenjunkies I cant say anything about the story...but my god does the CGI look terrible here.
screenjunkies Im just gonna wait it out and see how the movie goes........freaking Michel Bay
screenjunkies this looks ok... but you cant really judge until you view the whole movie for yourself... its a remake of the whole story of the turtles ... I dont see that as bad just wanting a fresh start on theyre characters .... I want to go see this to judge myself if its good or bad but also I am seeing it as a separate movie from the other turtles movies and series as a lot of the time they dont get it right (examples the last airbender and dragon ball) but other times they have done a good job...
screenjunkies So the Turtles are patterned after Greezel from Ghoulies? I guess that makes sense, the turtles live in the sewer and Greezel likes to emerge from toilets.
screenjunkies Im cautiously optimistic. Bay is only involved in a producer sense so hopefully we dont just get a bunch of action blur and depth less characters.
screenjunkies I respect all of your guys opinions, we all want to see something different, but quite frankly, im pretty excited for the movie, the turtles new looks are... ok I guess, I mean they arent really uglyper say, but they did get buffer, and much more muscular, the lips are a bit odd, but when you think about it, the TCRI mutagen not only turned them into large turtles, but humanoid turtles, which is why they can walk on only 2 legs, also the back story, its not the best, its not the worst, but its cool to get something new, you guys need to understand, this movie is a reboot, not a continuation, they get an all new back story, and new looks, possibly even new enemies, and for those who didnt notice, the foot also got new looks, and since its the current time, they are using guns! That is awesome, I cant wait for this movie, its gonna be awesome, and also GODZILLA
screenjunkies God damn it, am going to kep asking till you do it! Do Expendables 1  2. And say: Hey ho silver, AWAAEAEAAEAEYYY...
screenjunkies To the people who may see this film  Do whatever you have to do to not support these film makers. Theyve left too many details in the dark as a trap to make you go see it to find out if its any good. And supporting the filmmakers supports that method of releasing movies (or not releasing).
screenjunkies Well...I might just watch it, if that the case
screenjunkies if they say booyakasha imma slap a bitch
screenjunkies didnt mention the fact that the bros look like shrek
screenjunkies Holy shit. When they started busting out old action figures it brought back some memories. I had every single one of those.
screenjunkies Well I dont care if its bad or good I just want to enjoy it.
screenjunkies Bay should just make porn.....lots of suckage
screenjunkies The 2000s turtles were the best
screenjunkies All movies of micheal bay is like transformers... and the island... please... no more micheal bay movies...
screenjunkies they look like ugly fat babies with shells . . . . .
screenjunkies GET MEGAN FOX OUT THE MOVIE!! and fix their ugly faces.. i mean i know they are mutants, but i dont wanna be afraid of their faces :(
screenjunkies GET MEGAN FOX OUT THE MOVIE!! and fix their ugly faces.. i mean i know they are mutants, but i dont wanna be afraid of their faces :(
screenjunkies I am the eternal optimist I think its going to kick butt. I must say that What i have seen of what the turtles look like is so totally awesome. No one knows what it will be like until its out and we see it for our selves. So lets just wait it out and have fun no matter what all I can say is I grew up on them and i am not one bit disappointed. We will see what happens with this new franchise I can see it going very far. Kowabunga!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies YAAAAAAAAAAAAAY BEBOP AND ROCKSTEADY MIGHT BE IN DA FILM!  FANBOY SCREAM
screenjunkies Wow.....didnt know Black Nerd Guy had a gut
screenjunkies Megan as April... NO!!!!
screenjunkies Bunch of whining little bitches oh boo boo he ruined my childhood when clearly your childhood is over he cant ruin the past only the future man up you skirt wearing pussies
screenjunkies I like this because it seems based on the comic books that came out before the 1987 show. This brings me to another point the turtles were ruined by that show in the 80s. That stupid show already had its movie trilogy in the 90s. No its time for the comic books2003 show to get a movie, and whether you like it or not this is it. So quit bitching!!!
screenjunkies Their heads are massive
screenjunkies I will see this movie. I dont care about the reviews how good put bad they see. Ive been a Ninja Turtles fan since I was a kid.
screenjunkies How about all you haters not watch the movie? All of you whining and complaining about how horrible it will be are better off. Keep watching your cartoons or make your own movie. Am I the only one sick and tired of people whining like little bitches?
screenjunkies One question on my mind is, why the fuck is one of the turtles giant like and destroying the city.
screenjunkies michael bay can always stick to the original origin story and just mature it up...like the turtles actually cuts and stabs people from the foot clan or any criminals they come across (becoz they are ninjas brah) and beat the shit outta them......I can see like leonardo bashing someones head for information ala batmanthis would fly IMO
screenjunkies From what I see from the trailer this wasnt just Hollywood raping my childhood this was them jacking off on its cold dead corpse. I know we all have problems with it. Shredder is white and Megan Fox as April but it could be M. Night Shyamalan directing so really it could be worse. So much fucking worse.
screenjunkies looks better than the original any day
screenjunkies That p.f. krangs shirt is on point. Well done sir.
screenjunkies But why do the turtles look so freaky. Theyve got a big nose and lips. Like some sort of weird turtlehuman inbreeding experiment gone wrong. Totally ugly
screenjunkies ninja turles  amazing spider man
screenjunkies Why is no one talking about the fact that the two dimensional Megan Fox is playing April Oneill
screenjunkies megan fox, again?... gee
screenjunkies The archie TMNT series was mad cool...time travel, samurai roots, environmentalism...too bad it was cut short by, like all good things, lack of sales
screenjunkies Not a bad trailer but not enough to dispose me of my suspicions. Friggin Megan Fox?! Why?!
screenjunkies I dont care if you racebend April, hell, I dont even care if you genderbend April, THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT IS THAT SHE STILL HAS TO BE A REDHEAD!!! Come on, movie!
screenjunkies Am I the only one gettin mad watchin this..?? How much money did they pay you guys to sit there and kiss all tht hollywood ass and mislead die hard turtle fans?
screenjunkies Im wary. I hope they dont lose all of the turtles character and make it ridiculously overconvoluted...
screenjunkies is Leonardo going to finally cut someones head off with those swords?So lame to have a weapon that you cant really use.
screenjunkies Ill make a objective decision after I see it, but if this sucks, Michel Bay may lose every fan he ever hoped to have.
screenjunkies I like it when I saw Leo and I could get behind him, but mickeys nose just does not work. I am hoping they show in the next trailer more of all four brothers. Also more about the shredder.
screenjunkies how can you even wear a TMNT shirt and NOT know the names of the figures??? come on now thats about enough of this interview for me.
screenjunkies 1. Megan Fox is NOTHING like April ONeil.2. Michael Bay probably wants to pork her still so that why he hired her.3. The turtles arent even teenagers, they clearly have adult voices.4.Although the movie looks good, to me I just imagine a turtle in a ninja costume with explosions around it. basically like any Michael Bay film (minus the turtle).5. Hell mess it up with his shit script writers.
screenjunkies Payoff honest movie trailers is no longer honest
screenjunkies The Matrix, The Big Lebowski, Lon, Pulp Fiction, Terminator 2, The Silence of The Lambs, Edward Scissorhands, Dances with Wolves.
screenjunkies I am excited about the movie, but I am not sure Michael Bay is the right choice, the Transformers are the prototype of a turd trilogy, lets hope someone kept him from filling the movie with explosions
screenjunkies Andre marry me!! :) You are so adorable!
screenjunkies I am hoping that this movie is good, I just cannot stress enough just how miscast April ONeil is. Not saying Miss Fox is or is not bad at acting, just saying that she is completely wrong for the part. Casting is not as simple as going to your standby eye candy and throwing a yellow coat on her and putting a camera in her hand.
screenjunkies i want bebop, rocksteady, craing, baxter stockman the technodrome and dimention X
screenjunkies could it be worse than 1998 Godzilla?...
screenjunkies The guy from prison break
screenjunkies I thought the trailer looked okish, but I dont like the new look they gave the turtles. Sure, you can change a couple of things on the way they look and dress, but in this case its kind of ugly. I really didnt get excited when I saw the trailer because I got excited for Transformers and it didnt stand up to my expectations, leaving me very skeptical with these kind of movies. And I dont like the idea of having Megan Fox as April, she aint the April we want.
screenjunkies It might be good but the CGI looks awful, I cant even look at the turtles!
screenjunkies Why are the turtles on fricken roids? Look at how huge they are
screenjunkies imma see the movie frist before i give my opinion cuz im not a douche bag
screenjunkies after failformers nah not enterested in this bs movie and does this director have a hard on for fox or what cmon there are other better actresses out there.......

screenjunkies Hello guys! My name is Oscar, Im from Kansas and I am a hugeeeee fan of your shows I have seen every single honest trailer and hals screen junkies shows more then 3 times, your content is just so great I recommended to anybody, so, in honor of my great aprecciation and loyalty to your channel I would like to ask you a huge favor.After I saw captain america 2, I was blown away with the movie but there something that made me rage about it and I would love if you could ask the following phrase when you do the captain america 2 honest trailer:You seen captain americas shield hold its own againts Thors Hammer (shows scene of the avengers), but cant fucking keep it together againts a grenade launcher (shows scene of the winter soldier shooting a grenade to captain america).Hopefully you could include this, and if youre wondering why I am pissed, is because thors hammer was made from a core of a dying star which weight more than a million tons, have a nice day and I hope you find this phase good enough for an honest trailer, goodbye!

screenjunkies Scenes that disturbed me:Pinocchio turning into donkeySe7en pretty much any sceneMidnight express tongue ripping outThe Matrix neo getting bugged
screenjunkies Ive watched Audition thanks to this video.I...I... just... dont know what to say. All I can do is sink back into my chair and look at the ceiling.
screenjunkies It took me a while to recover from Requiem For A Dream. Quite fucked up but more so particularly depressing for me.
screenjunkies About 80 of Gangster No. 1. Theres also this one scene in the first episode of the One Missed Call TV series, girl got her neck slowly severed by a pane of glass sliding off from the back of a lorry while she was trapped behind it, watching as the pane just slide slowly her way. It was a while before I could sit near windows.
screenjunkies Plenty of them out there. Torantino is the master than it comes to them though. Which of his movies doesnt have fd up stuff in them? Exactly.Anyways a few to mention would be Buried, Hannibal Holocaust(this one actually had real life animal butchering)...and man a few of them I cant even recall the names of, If talking about TV shows I would put Game of Thrones(them torture scenes are just brutal to watch) and Spartacus Blood and sand.
screenjunkies Gremlins  when the mother fights the evil gremlins she put one in the microwave and one in the blender.  I saw that in the theater when i was 9.
screenjunkies The hospital sequence in Jacobs Ladder. I think its the furthest I can go with cringeinducing before I turn my head and close my eyes. Also its simultaneously ugly and beautiful. Like a Francis Bacon painting.
screenjunkies The scene at 1:00 where the guy on the left has a big ol camel toe!I cant unsee that, bitch.WTF.
screenjunkies Pink Flamingos: Divine ate dog poop for real. Also chicken rapeGumo was pretty Fd up to.
screenjunkies A Clockwork Orange is up there when he rapes the woman while singing.
screenjunkies Ive been waiting fo someone to say it but they havent so I shall.Bowling alley scene in Suicide ClubThat movie has soooo many messed up scenes but that one even trumps the Audition scene by far!
screenjunkies L short from ABCs of death or any of the deaths scenes from Maniac.
screenjunkies Anything by Aronofsky, that guy is very sick... I wish I never get exposed to any movie hes involved ever again, I had to make a freakin study out of Requiem for a dream, that movie is so fd up...
screenjunkies Wrong turn four when they are eating the guy alive!
screenjunkies Only god forgives was pretty fucked up as a whole. The rape scene in girl with the dragon tattoo is pretty fucked.
screenjunkies the rape of the baby in a serbian film
screenjunkies Frozen... where the guy jumps from the cable car, to when he is being eaten by the wolves. I had nightmares of that.
screenjunkies Baron Harkonnen fondling a dying sex slave in David Lynchs Dune.
screenjunkies The evil dead tree rape scene and pretty much any scene in a clockwork Orange.
screenjunkies In Gozu a man was born.
screenjunkies Hard Candy is my favorite. That fake castration scene is what sold me on Ellen Page for good, I dont care what shes in, Im going to see it.
screenjunkies Shuts Eyes I cant hear you! I cant hear you!
screenjunkies Tree Rape scene from the Evil Dead. I mean, its a funny movie, but damn is it shocking when she gets raped by a tree.
screenjunkies like half of Snowtown!
screenjunkies What about a clock work orange , I spit on your grave , strangeland , or even the fireflys from devils rejects rape sex with dead people a torture pit with a crazy doctor cutting faces off and wearing them some of that is pt 1 house of a 1000 corpses but there are loads of good gruesome clips decent lineup could of had a few Better ones though
screenjunkies The scene in Trainspotting when hes locked in his childhood room with the dead baby on the ceiling.
screenjunkies Whod a thunk it, but Rob Reiner directed a scene that did it for me... Misery... Sledgehammer... Ankle.
screenjunkies Fk u dude. Its 340 am now I am not gonna sleep
screenjunkies the one scene in the fly where the chick has the maggot baby
screenjunkies the devils rejects!! and not a seen the whole god damn movie!
screenjunkies Village of the damned 1995: In the first half of the movie when you see all the mothers give birth to the babies on the exact same day, you will notice that one of them seemed to have had a miscarriage, which Dr. Susan immediately takes away to her secret lab. Afterwards throughout the movie we see the children look like normal kids with just the same white hair, but then later on when Dr. Susan takes one of the fathers to her secret lab, we are shown what the still born baby looks like in its natural alien form, which in my opinion is the most WTF part in the movie.
screenjunkies completely off topic but Hal Rudnick has a sick shoe game
screenjunkies Tongue cut and tooth rip. OLD BOY.
screenjunkies the scene where the baby is getting raped in the movie a siberian film
screenjunkies The most fed up scene Ive ever seen is from A Serbian Film. This scene can be summed up in two words: Newborn Porn. Ugh.
screenjunkies teletabies jump to the hole scenes and baby sun was fucked up
screenjunkies Plague Dogs when the farmer shoots himself in the face.
screenjunkies In the Exorcist when Regan is stabbing herself with a crucifix though the scene that most disturbed me was the spider walk down the stairs. Twin Peaks is also way creepy. Bob crawling towards the camera, and pretty much anything in the Black Lodge. (So now Im sitting here alone in my room, thinking about the moments in film that have haunted me most. Awesome.)
screenjunkies What about Singapore Sling, when the mom who is a hermaphrodite, ties up the detective on her bed, rapes him by riding him, and then when she orgasms, she sticks her finger down her throat and pukes on his face?
screenjunkies the scene in the movie evil dead(2013). when the branch of the tree goes into her vagina...creepyy

screenjunkies i guess i was warned, but why did i watch this

screenjunkies can anyone give the movie list?
screenjunkies How about the scene from Train Spotting where they wake up from a weeks long high and the infant child is showed already decaying in the crib. I immediately was turned off by that movie as being a comedy.I just could not finish watching that movie after that.
screenjunkies As a kid, there were two movie scenes that scared me. One was the maggot birth in The Fly and blood filled balloons in Stephen Kings It. As an adult I saw a Japanese movie with a sick, dying mermaid covered in pus bubbles. An artist was using her pus to paint. The rest of that movie was rapey. I still cant get those visuals out of my head.
screenjunkies My Achilles heel feels wierd
screenjunkies What about the rapeburning scene from the hills have eyes?
screenjunkies Oldboy when the final twist is revealed is so fucked up
screenjunkies Antichrist. All of it.

screenjunkies The Korean Movie, I Saw the Devil is probably the most disturbing and scariest movie Ive ever watched.
screenjunkies Dead baby on the ceiling in Trainspotting was one of the most disturbing things Ive seen on film.

screenjunkies killer joe chiken wing blow job
screenjunkies For me its gotta be that scene in Hannibal where Hannibal feeds Krendler (Ray Liotta) his own brain.
screenjunkies the rape scene in irreversible, but also the early scene where cassel bashes the guys head in. that movie is insanely disturbing
screenjunkies Vhs 2 cult scene. That was some freaky shit!
screenjunkies 3:11 (heavy breathing)
screenjunkies Knife stabbing scene in Saving Private Ryan has always bothered me more than just about any other messed up movie scene Ive seen.
screenjunkies the passion of the Christ , torture scene
screenjunkies You failed to mention, ANY POLLY SHORE MOVIE!!! Now THEY are Fked UP!
screenjunkies Anything from The Men Behind the Sun.
screenjunkies For me still... David Lynchs Movie. Eraserhead is the most fucked up movie ever made!
screenjunkies I was really surprised they mentioned Ichi the killer, and I think the most fucked scene is that whole movie. A guy who keeps his mouth together with piercings and gets off on pain, a girl getting her nipples cut off, the one dude having all those nails driven into his skull and then being left in the street. And the one scene where the old man just crushes a guy into almost nothing!The movie just gets worse and worse as you go man
screenjunkies Anything directed by Yoshihiro Nishimura e.g. entirety of tokyo gore police.
screenjunkies How do I put this? Most things described here are the obvious choices, lets dig deeper. Lets say Louis Malles fed up Black Moon. After Lily discovers the dead girl which is eaten by the chickens, brother Lily (everybodys name is Lily) buries her in an already prepared grave, Lily cannot stand the burial, she runs to a huge pig and falls to the ground, gets beaten up by imaginary naked children, kicks a tree, steps on some crying flowers and finally meets the unicorn. The first thing the unicorn says is that Lily is mean for running after it, for beating up the children (?), kicking the tree and destroying the flowers, while the unicorn itself is eating flowers from the ground. Their conversation gets weirder and weirder until someone throws a plate on Lily. That someone is an old lady, who died and was somehow resurrected by drinking breast milk out of her daughter earlier (sister Lily). The unicorn suggests that the old lady isnt real at all. Ive seen a lot of fed up st in my life but this movie made me fall in love with Cinema once again, you dont need drugs for watching this, this movie is the only drug you need.
screenjunkies That was terrible. I regret watching this.
screenjunkies TETSUO the iron man, bit in the scene both merge together, his cock turns into a massive drill whilst fuckin his wife cutting her to shreds, and that scene also has flashing scenes of him being raped by a woman with a Hoover sucking ou his organsI RECOMEND everyone to see it
screenjunkies The ending to Stephen Kings The Mist.
screenjunkies Judge Dooms resurrection , Who Framed Roger Rabbit
screenjunkies Part of Silence of the Lambs when the killer asks the girl her dress size to see if she will fit in his skin suit
screenjunkies New born porn from A serbian film. I wanted to throw up..
screenjunkies Salo and Irreversible are definitely at the top for f up scenes. Eyes Without A Face and Sisters has always stuck with me.
screenjunkies Altered states. The trip he had when he drank the stuff the native people gave him. He ended up turning into a sand sculpture of him self along with his girl and blowing away in the wind.
screenjunkies One opinion is enough, your opinion (the talking head) is all we need.I dont want to tune in and listen to a panel! This format sucks on real TV and now it is popping up everywhere on Youtube.Sorry, but YOUR panel is US the subscribers, and the opinions we want to hear are from other subscribers in the comments colum.This really could have been a fun relevant post and maybe only five minutes long.Instead it was padded and laime while your topic was brilliant.Fail.
screenjunkies IRREVERSIBLE  the scene with the FIRE EXTINGUISHER, thats pretty rank 0o. The Fly 2  dog scene is :(((
screenjunkies A Serbian Film: The whole damn movie.
screenjunkies Mysterious Skin. Its the scene where Neil gets raped...
screenjunkies This fucking dude raped a baby not 30 seconds after being born. If youre a human fucking being dont watch the movie a Serbian film.

screenjunkies What about the last few Fast  Furious?
screenjunkies But he is John McClain u see.
screenjunkies Do The RaidThe Raid 2. Who the hell didnt die in those two films?
screenjunkies most of these deaths are BS. Ive seen people hit in the same way in RL and they dont get rip fractors or insta death from a bottle to the head.
screenjunkies Well at least he (barely) survives Die Hard 2! lol Who would have thought that a film with special forces and air plane explosions would be the most survivable :D
screenjunkies Dam son level 3 doesnt fuck around
screenjunkies Joke is funny for a minute but after that just gets old :(

screenjunkies INDIANA JONES SERIES PLZ
screenjunkies More Honest Action please!!! Do Mortal Kombat or some kung fu movie! XD
screenjunkies So this means that the Home Alone series is more violent than the Die Hard series.
screenjunkies Do Captain America The First Avenger!!!!!!
screenjunkies Do the raid 1 or 2 also honest trailer
screenjunkies Do 24 with Jack Bauer !
screenjunkies please a 24 trailer!!
screenjunkies IF YOU DONT DO CASINO ROYALE YOURE MISSING OUT.

screenjunkies Do a Kick Ass honest action
screenjunkies Do it on a season of The Dudesons! 100 deaths Ill guess, according to this way of doing it!
screenjunkies Say you know what time it is, its time to spin the wheel of mythicality.
screenjunkies Do honest action of Daniel Craigs James Bond movies!
screenjunkies you should do a follow up series where they talk about how long it would take to recover in relation to what happens in the story of the movie
screenjunkies do Pirates of the Caribbean
screenjunkies Avengers because if Thor was a real human he would be dead tons of times!
screenjunkies A good call for honest action would be any 007 movie
screenjunkies Im thinking maybe do the batman movies
screenjunkies I know its not really an action movie, but please do Passion of the Christ.
screenjunkies Rambo 1 to 5!!oh wait 6!?
screenjunkies do a james bond movie!!!
screenjunkies anchorman fight scenes, kickass, scott pilgrim vs the world, or, best of al kung Pao enter the fist
screenjunkies the expendables, lets see who lives.also iron man. bet you mr. stark is going to have a higher body count than the expendable mercs.
screenjunkies Is it just me Or does the voice sound like the old pokdex from Pokmon ?
screenjunkies Marvel Cinematic Universe
screenjunkies How about the dark knight trilogy?
screenjunkies you got to do Predator o got to see this
screenjunkies its kind of funny hearing the danube waltz in the background
screenjunkies Nice video!5:22  5:27 Exactly :D
screenjunkies ALL THE DARK KNIGHT MOVIES
screenjunkies Instead of How many John McClane..., use How many dead stuntman...
screenjunkies well lets just say john mcclane became invincible during die hard 4 and 5
screenjunkies just throwing it out there... Warcraft.. yet to see what happens :) what i heard and saw at BlizzCon.. its gonna be huge. check my profile to see the BlizzCon Warcraft Movie panel if you want to know aswell :)
screenjunkies Thing is that a lot of the best games out there wouldnt work as any form of media other than a game.
screenjunkies I wonder how a metroid movie would be...
screenjunkies I got two ideas...probably said already but... Viewiful Joe and The Wonderful...101!
screenjunkies Screen Junkies. Y U NO Mention Postal?
screenjunkies Dead Space: Downfall probably is the best video game spinoff movie.
screenjunkies The batman arkham games would make greatMovies
screenjunkies Silent Hill is easily the best video game movie, thus far.
screenjunkies Wreck it Ralph is the best video game movie HANDS DOWN!!!
screenjunkies Street Fighter II the Animated Movie was the BEST video game movie!!
screenjunkies Destroy all humans movie
screenjunkies Dark Souls movie. You couldnt have a movie with a more ambiguous story line.
screenjunkies I want to see a Duke Nukem movie.
screenjunkies Well, my idea isnt exactly just taking the game and making it into a movie, though the whole Dragonborn storyline in Skyrim alone could have the potential, if done properly, to be good, but rather make a movie about the war that takes place between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion. Because as players, we only know of this event later when playing Skyrim. It completely happens in transition between Oblivion and Skyrim. You could totally take that setting and build a plot from out of that. For instance, make up a movie where the remaining last few members of the Blades find and discover an infant with Talos bloodline aka the future Dragonborn that we play with in the later game and all the struggles they face trying to move the dragonborn infant across Cyrodil, while being pursued by Aldmeri agents, and over the border to safety because as dragon hunters it is their sworn duty to help and protect the dragonborn. With the right casting and the set pieces, you could make a very good last stand movie out of that idea like 300 or 13 assassins. Thats my opinion at least.But besides that, I have a close second... Metal Gear Solid. Though, now that i think about it... those games are already so cinematic. Liveaction adaptations of them sound pointless...
screenjunkies They should do a Halo movie
screenjunkies Were in the darkest timeline for video game movies.
screenjunkies Modern Warfare Trilogy ........ Shouldnt be too hard
screenjunkies Id like to see Viewtiful Joe made into a movie. I mean, it IS a video game about movies. Itd be neat.
screenjunkies Movies based on videogames will always be bad untill they make a good videogame based on a movie lol
screenjunkies ive heard of plans for bioshock, assassins creed, uncharted, and god of war moviesProbably all ones i would see
screenjunkies Final Fantasy not mentioned?
screenjunkies The resident evil movies were pretty decent
screenjunkies Have they made a movie for Rachet and Clank cz its like an aweskme game series aling with the batman arkham... games
screenjunkies Wreck it Ralph is my FAVORITE video game movie and one of my favorite movies period. Because of SUGAR RUSH if I were in the world of Sugar Rush, I WOULD EAT EVERYTHING (Then I would have a true sugar rush) LOL
screenjunkies I want a Batman Arkham movie that would be my dream come true
screenjunkies final fantasy advent children, amazing movie based off a video game
screenjunkies Far Cry 3 as a movie would be great. The story really turns the whole sorry about colonialism subgenre on its side i.e. Avatar, Dances with Wolves, The Last Samurai etc. It could undo the disaster that is the Uwe Boll Far Cry film.
screenjunkies the phoenix wright film was pretty damn perfect.
screenjunkies im waiting for The Last of Us, liveaction movie adaptation which is actually already been confirmed... the game itself is already 1010. itll be difficult to achieve the audiences expectation...
screenjunkies the tekken movie was good
screenjunkies Any one of the Assassins Creed games
screenjunkies Fallout and Elder Scrolls would be interesting
screenjunkies Im surprised they never brought up the resident evil movies.
screenjunkies MINECRAFT MINECRAFT MINECRAFT
screenjunkies Starcraft would make a great movie
screenjunkies Legend of Zelda  Ocarina of time
screenjunkies Silent Hill was good.
screenjunkies I wanna see Metal Gear Solid made into a movie
screenjunkies God of fucking WARRR, thats a movie that if its done with the right amount of violence and boobs could be like the new 300.
screenjunkies i am just sitting here waiting for hollywood to make the first pokemon movie. not the animated one
screenjunkies Wtf are you guys talking about? Silent Hill and Prince of Persia were both CRAP!
screenjunkies Max Payne would do an awesome movie!... oh, wait
screenjunkies Bioshock with a huge budget and amazing cast would win all.
screenjunkies Well as far as I know Im trying to have my hopes up that the Last of Us movie doesnt turn out to be a disaster but it bothers me a little that theyre still gonna have Joel and Ellie, instead of changing the characters like they said
screenjunkies I want a assassins creed movie.
screenjunkies I personally loved Final Fantasy the Spirits within.... as a video gamer I appreciated both the 3D rendering... the socalled cold acting and uncanny valley, which I didnt notice , which was inline with the dark world portrayed ... and the ORIGINAL story!
screenjunkies They made super Mario into a movie! really!
screenjunkies Resident Evil 1 was pretty dope
screenjunkies HALFLIFE!!!!!! WOULD BE AWESOME OR CALL OF DUTY 1 OR 2
screenjunkies 1.HALO 4 (or any other halo game), I want this game to have a movie.I heard the movie may be coming but was blocked by another movie, I think its Elysium or something else, I forgot...2.Bioshock Infinite, damn just think what a bioshock movie would be about?
screenjunkies Wreck it Ralph and Scott Pilgrim are two best movies for video game fans. I would like to see a super smash movie. There will be brawl had some solid moments, but I think an amazing movie could be told. Perhaps just start with Super Mario Bros and build the world out from there.
screenjunkies Its an easy answer a live action pokmon movie just not an Ash Ketchem character in the movie but do refrence the show and games
screenjunkies Bioshock infinite movie would be amazing
screenjunkies I dont think were ever going to get a perfect video game movie. Video games are fantastic because of the interactions between the game and the player. the events are scripted yet entirely spontaneous at the same time. I just dont think any linear plotted film is ever going to live up to the multidimensional appeal of a video game. Even a simple film like Doom didnt do justice to the simple concept of the game by ID, which was essentially the granddaddy of the FPS genre. Now that most games are so involved, I just dont think you could ever cover everything within the span of a film, even if that film is Return of the King long, and still keep your audience entertained.
screenjunkies Modern warfare trilogy
screenjunkies if hollywood wants to do another video game movie, the last of us is practically giftwrapped up for them....just saying.....
screenjunkies Halo Forward Unto Dawn was pretty good. Not sure if it was a thing when this was released.
screenjunkies just for record i love wreckitralph best video game movie ive seen but i rather see a new mario movie but with a different story, new plot points new main character with mario and luigi and make a saga of the mario bros. not the 1993 movie that just killed my childhood it kills it just saying as a fan in videogames
screenjunkies Instead of making sequels for Star Wars they should had done a movie trilogy based on the Knights of the Old Republic games
screenjunkies I do like silent hill and resident evil
screenjunkies best ever?.....wreck it ralph...
screenjunkies Skyrim: Dragons, nords and imperials, in a free for all!
screenjunkies Hands down Halo would make an epic movie, even without master chief
screenjunkies I feel like Hit Man with Timothy Olyphant really deserved to be on the list of decent game movies. It was a half decent movie, even without playing the games.
screenjunkies I really like the Hitman movie.
screenjunkies Id love to see Dead Space go to the big screen but its gotta be done right. Stuff will be left out but as long as its true to the story and the effects are John Carpenters The Thing level, thats fine.Im surprised you guys didnt mention the Resident Evil series. That, by far, was the most disappointing video game movie. The source material was right there yet they choose to build a story that in no way relates to the game. I.e. clones, virtual simulations, super powers. Also, the idea of introducing well known characters later rather than from the start was annoying. Casting was unrealistic. Nemesis was really the only awesome thing from the series. That and Jill was fuckin hot! I say we need a reboot, true to the source material.
screenjunkies Would love Heavy Rain as a film, absolutely clever script and I think it could be done really cleverly with people not knowing the killer until the end (unless youve played the video game) Could be the next Se7en...
screenjunkies I want so see Sam rami direct a borderlands movie
screenjunkies do you think its weird that movie goers hate moviegames, and gamers hate gamemovies
screenjunkies Halo would always be the best game used in a film. While the best videogame film Ive watched would be Mass Effect: Paragon Lost, followed by the Tomb Raider film. I the best Ive watched because I think they are right. THE BEST has yet to be made.
screenjunkies If they make a The Last Of Us movie ill cry of happiness. itll have to be good tho
screenjunkies I dont want to see an Assassins Creed movie, but now that its going to happen I hope is at least good and that Ubisoft doesnt focus on the games main characters and uses the oportunity to expand the AC universe with new characters while focusing on the main story line
screenjunkies Zelda Movie. Animated Zelda Movie.
screenjunkies We are cutting ice, cause we are cutting ice!MUST YOU MAKE ME FALL OFF MY CHAIR LAUGHING

screenjunkies Can you do shes the man
screenjunkies Love frozen honest tralier can not get it out of my head
screenjunkies do a honest to smiley

screenjunkies This movie was not that great ppl
screenjunkies FOR THE MOTHER OF GOD DO AN HONEST TRAILER FOR TANGLED!

screenjunkies I need a full version of Get It Out...
screenjunkies Please do as above so below

screenjunkies Say The Cheese is my friend. I will have cheese till the end.
screenjunkies Frozens actually not a bad movie this is a parody dont take it too seriously
screenjunkies wait wait this isnt a honest trailer cuz like she got fucking big in 3 years if its only 3 years....its more like 10 years just 3 years between her mum n dad dying and her sister becoming old enuf to be queen...just saying if you gonna be honest well at lest be honest bros
screenjunkies this is freaking the best. but i still love frozen )
screenjunkies did anybody see the easter egg at 1:08
screenjunkies The girl singing is not so good
screenjunkies The parodied lyrics to Let it Go are so true. Someone needs to make a full cover of that. Holy freakin crap, that song is EVERYWHERE. You cant even say the words let it go in my school anymore without half the class bursting into song. The other day, we got into a debate on responsibilities we have as American citizens, and it ended with the most annoying kid in my class arguing with the teacher about adoption vs. abortion and the rest of us yelling at him to just shut up. I made the mistake of telling him to let it go, and next thing I hear is: LET IT GO! LET IT GO! CANT HOLD IT BACK ANYMOOOOOOREEEEE!!!
screenjunkies maybe it is just me,but outside of the plot,character development and music i find the drawing style pretty lazy,i know the CGI effect looks ok but all the characters with close ages and same gender have the same facial features and proportions.
screenjunkies ...a hot guy!LMAO!!! XDD
screenjunkies the wickedly talented Adele Dazeem:D
screenjunkies I STILL READ IT!The cold never bothered me anyway!

screenjunkies This channel is fucking annoying because of this guy. His videos are so fucking biased. All he does is talk shit about actors or movies he doesnt like. Its annoying.
screenjunkies Watching a Japanese commercial is like getting inside the mind of a schizophrenic.
screenjunkies The most useless host segments. Seriously, if you had posted those without having host segments for padding, then it would have felt less like AFV. This video eats it.
screenjunkies George Clooney and Matt Damon are making Nespresso Commercials, we Swedes are picky xD

screenjunkies Is that some BoC playing in Leos second commercial?
screenjunkies I would want to see Johnny Travolta do an add in Spain because there is no way he could say any words right if he was advertising dragonfly software to type what you say!
screenjunkies Seriously, Tommy Lee Jones and BOSS Drinks. He is a friggin alien!
screenjunkies Kirin Ichiban beer are amazing though.
screenjunkies You should take a look at those TOMMY LEE JONES BOSS coffee in can Japanese commercials
screenjunkies Christian Bale should do a tampon commercial in Russia.
screenjunkies Tom hiddleston doing one of those dos equios beer commercials. I want him to be sitting on a blue satin couch and also have him wear his blue suit her wore to the Cannes festival. And he will be really hot when he says stay thirsty my friends
screenjunkies Of course, this is in the 80s and 90s when the japanese economic bubble was at its biggest. They must have been paying well over the odds for these celebs to be in their commercials.
screenjunkies I wanna see Jayden Smith do something in Japan... as long as Jaden has absolutely nothing to do with it.

screenjunkies Id like to see Tom Hiddleston in America doing me (Im straight but Jesus Christ, Im also kidding)
screenjunkies It just sounds like Eddie is being racist

screenjunkies HEY YOU GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies I wish youd implement the following part into this episode:A movie that for the 10,000,000th time reinforces the fact that Hollywood has no idea how to do any foreign accent besides British.
screenjunkies TOOK ME AN HOUR TO STOP LAUGHING....
screenjunkies That Mutant Persian Goatman should have his own movie. His existence raises so many questions.
screenjunkies might as well read the book....lol...love it.
screenjunkies Not sure if they have access to Galactus, the Skrulls, or Annihilus since they are all tied to the fantastic four.
screenjunkies I thought Rocket Racoon was a racoon that had been experimented on.
screenjunkies Ha theyre like the avengers B team.
screenjunkies Guardians is going to POP like a popcorn machine with free butter!
screenjunkies vinny went from iron to wood. interesting.
screenjunkies This has to connect to Thanos because Drax the destroyer only got his name because he wants to kill Thanos.
screenjunkies I think as a stand alone movie in itself it will be great to watch especially if youre just looking to entertain yourself a 2 hours. Or even if youre not really following the series.It has action, it has comedy, it has a talking racoon, people will see it regardless of being a super hero fan or not. It just looks like fun.That all being said, anyone following the Avengers series will most likely see this movie, and that already has a very large following. This movie just expands it even more. This movie will definitely be a huge success, I really cant wait for it.
screenjunkies 4:32 sooooooo league of legends solo queue: the movie?
screenjunkies My favorite thing about this is the tagline that says Youre welcome
screenjunkies Make an honest trailer for honest trailers!
screenjunkies Its gonna be great! Im excited.
screenjunkies the fat bald guy needs to stop referencing han solo. we get it, u wanna suck him up. WE GET IT.
screenjunkies I thought the trailer looked good, but to be honest I didnt know anything about these characters until a couple of years ago since Im not a comic book guy. I hope the movie is going to be good but I cant judge until after I see it.
screenjunkies And still no Black Panther movie smh...
screenjunkies Right up front about the whole Shia debacle. I wonder if they lost any subs over that, cuz it was super douchey. Not quite Shia levels of douchey, but still.
screenjunkies The Trailer looks good. Im going to see it.
screenjunkies All i know is that Deadbeat show looks terrible.
screenjunkies I find it amazing that this movie is going to exist.Thankfully Antman is going to get a movie as well. Thats the thing I want to see!!
screenjunkies vin diesel, a badass actor, is now a Fcking tree........ best. idea. ever.
screenjunkies they will first start off hating and not liking each other but will eventually start working better as a team, same with the avengers
screenjunkies I think the movie will be a huge success. It might not have as much star power as The Avengers, but it could be a great film to introduce a whole new age of comic book lovers.
screenjunkies the lack of nose on groot reminds me too much of HeWhoShallNotBeNamed...
screenjunkies Wheres nova from ultatimite spiderman they did a whole episode about it what happened look it up people it did happen the guardians are novas family
screenjunkies I want a pet rocket...
screenjunkies Its gonna pop my cosmic cherry.
screenjunkies its going to explode with a force equvilant to the amount of times the phrase IM BATMAN has been used :P
screenjunkies it will still be better than any recent dc movies
screenjunkies this is connected somehow to avengers because one of the villains, The Collector, appears at the end of Thor: The dark World
screenjunkies oh my god marvel is making a film about a raccoon and we cant even do wonder woman
screenjunkies Disney is mopping up :)Yay for Mickey
screenjunkies Did he spit on them at 6:22 when he said POP!?
screenjunkies how couldnt you mention that the voice of the racoon is bradley cooper hes the only good actor in the movie
screenjunkies I think if it wasnt a marvel movie, I would like it better. But just the fact that marvel is stooping this low, seems like they are getting desperate and scraping the bottom of the barrel, when they have so many other better characters they could make movies of seems kind of stupid.
screenjunkies Of course, its going to be great!
screenjunkies U guys do know that the guardians of the galaxie is also in the amazing spiderman, the new cartoon when he joins shield. In one of the episodes spiderman fights besides the guardians of the galaxie so ya....
screenjunkies I expect this film to be completely shit, Id be highly surprised if Im wrong.
screenjunkies im sorry the movie is not going to pop. i mean seriously its got rocket raccoon there fore its goin to be a big bang, am i right guardians fans?
screenjunkies I think its gonna be great but it looks a little confusing at this point and is a little too jokey for what people will be expecting from a movie like this.
screenjunkies It will be AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Cant wait for this movie to bomb. I want that so badly.Bootista sucks. No one knows these characters. Really hope people dont want to see a Marvel comedy. Yes, Im a hater.
screenjunkies Fuck, I can not wait for this movie.
screenjunkies I like that fact ol dude got the black toe 1s on
screenjunkies NOVA...... Guardians of the Galaxy 2 NEEDS nova
screenjunkies Its going to snap crackle pop rice crispy style.
screenjunkies Is it gonna flop or is it gonna pop? thats what she said
screenjunkies I was never a fan of Guardians of the Galaxy, except for Root and my Raccoon XD.I do hope it goes well but I am not as hyped. It just feels there for Marvel to make more money unless they try to tie it into the Avengers series Marvel is making. However it needs to be well carried out.
screenjunkies did I just watch an ad for your channel in your channel?
screenjunkies I love the comic they better not screw this up
screenjunkies From viewing Guardians of the Galaxy trailer, these group of traveling space mercinares almost share parallel attitudes like Star Wars mercinaes and smugglers from two universes. So, yeah it might pop in a successful story telling way.
screenjunkies I was an avid comic book collector in the 1980s and early 90s and I have never heard of Guardians of the Galaxy! News to me. Looks okay though, might go check it out if Ive got to entertain some kids for an afternoon. Really looking forward to XMEN Days of Future Past though, holy moley does that look amazing. What a cast!
screenjunkies Please do am honest trailer on this
screenjunkies Still hate Bradley cooper as rocket, person that voiced rocket raccoon in umvc3 should have done it.
screenjunkies I want a Nightwing hoodie!
screenjunkies Boooooooooooooooootista
screenjunkies I feel like such a terrible geek for not noticing the Infinity Gauntlet in Thor! I am super excited by the thought of Thanos battling to complete the gems. But, since they did this storyline on The Super Hero Squad cartoon, would it be overkill?
screenjunkies Do you guys have a arc of the covenant
screenjunkies Man, I am way more interested in this movie now than I was before.
screenjunkies So looking forward to sexy nebula akaa gorgeous gillan
screenjunkies How could you not mention that Peter Quill is part alien?!
screenjunkies Looks cool. But I cant wait till Infinity Gauntlet comes out. I will ejaculate on Thanos mighty chest as he fist me with his ginormous hand. JINKIES
screenjunkies I think the movie will POP! I think it will be as the video said almost a broadening step to expose more stories and bring it villains and heros and not only that but will bring in stories that can be made into incredible movies
screenjunkies What is it with talking racoons...
screenjunkies I love the idea of it but I just bet this movie is gonna bomb! The thing that made the avengers popular was that the heroes were built up through individual movies and then put together. Thats what made it such a success. These characters arent even nearly as well known as the avengers and havent even had a real introduction. Marvel have not advertised the movie well enough. Im not even sure what audience this movie is aimed at! There are parts that look like theyre made for kids and other parts that look more for adults! I seriously have a bad feeling about this one and Im sure Im not the only one.
screenjunkies Mark Andreyko, shut up and let the other dude finish a sentence
screenjunkies Hes the muscle on the team said about multiple characters lol...the movie looks pretty cool though :)
screenjunkies Nice Jordan 1 Black Toe!
screenjunkies These guys dont know shit. Drax is the Wolverine of the team, not the Colossus. Gamora is Thanoss adopted daughter. Star Lord doesnt think highly of himself and originally Groot said a lot more than, I am Groot.
screenjunkies Honestly, I think this movies going to be a success, but not in the way the Avengers or Iron Man 3 was. I think casting proves the point that this movie is sort of feeling things out for the possibility of adding the Cosmic aspect of the Marvel universe into the Movie format without losing the audience theyve gained over the past few years. Will the movie be good? Probably. Will it be a box office hit like the Avengers? Maybe. Will it introduce the everyday movie goer to the cosmic realm of Marvel Comics? Yes. Thats a good thing.
screenjunkies So you ripped off Totalbiscuits WTF is... series. Hopefully youll receive a copyright infringement strike for that.
screenjunkies Its ganna kickin like chicken
screenjunkies If I want to watch a bunch of guys pretend to know what their talking about, I watch sports center
screenjunkies the mother fucker in the jumper wont let any one else speak
screenjunkies zoe saldana its dominicanpuerto rican, nothing to do with colombia
screenjunkies hmmm i wasnt looking forward to this movie, but the characters seems good, lol gotta be better then spider man and xmen
screenjunkies Why the fuck is Hals audio so much louder?
screenjunkies rocket and groot  teemo and maokai
screenjunkies perfect honest trailer for an overrated movie )
screenjunkies If you couldnt breathe, then you wouldnt be able to talk.  I cant breathe, well bitch you are wasting valuable breath trying to talk.stfu
screenjunkies Almost.... Almost..........Almost.

screenjunkies great movie but 1:49 that is totally honest truth.
screenjunkies This sums up the movie pretty well, o still enjoyed it tho (dont judge me)
screenjunkies Thank you! I seriously didnt like this movie at all. 90 of the appeal was just the special effects. Oh, and Incompetent Ripley. Bahahahaha
screenjunkies Gravity sucked so hard haha xD
screenjunkies Say: There will only be 8 planets after I destroy Uranus.
screenjunkies Also god moral cliche.
screenjunkies I guess this movie is ment to inspire our generation 2 be astronauts

screenjunkies nononononononono Lls so tru
screenjunkies ... or someone elses phone on the bus.
screenjunkies Have you ever thought of doing video game trailers. You should do Call of Duty: Ghosts and say something about Jackie Chan
screenjunkies The very beginning is my exact reaction right after watching this movie.
screenjunkies What is Gravity about?
screenjunkies Do 12 years a slave, you cowards!
screenjunkies god im glad I didnt see this movie. looked boring as hell. also, those pinball machine noises were so fucking funny!!!

GameSack I never though Maester Lewin would die, I liked him and it saddened me so much!
retrogametech Should should mod it and out some LED lights on it etc...
retrogametech Buy a N64 or an original playstation to repairrefurbish and add to your collection :P
retrogametech yay, I knew youd return :Dedit: If you are having trouble finding new consoles to buy and fix you should just buy random broken consoles and try to fix them as a challenge and see if you can resell them for a profit
retrogametech How many videos are you thinking to upload per week  month? because lets face it: it took a loooong time for another video to be coming. but i still trusted in getting more videos from you and that worked out good. please answer my question it would make my day.
retrogametech Nice fix! Glad to see another video from you.
retrogametech Hah, you are like a techno womble or something. Great stuff, good find. I guess most people when something breaks down, they are afraid to even open a plug. We tinkerers though, get out our tool kits.
retrogametech There is something very appealing about the graphics on a Vectrex. Good job dude )
retrogametech I took a chance on a Vectrex 2 years back for the same price with the same fault but rewiring the plug did nothing. I spent hours tinkering with the console and ended up hating the thing.
retrogametech Great console I had one of these a good game to get for is is called spike
retrogametech man... you really lucked out on that one!
retrogametech Always good to see you put another great vid on youtube man. Great find!
retrogametech Ha ha!!! Nice! Easiest fix ever.
retrogametech Glad to see you havent stopped doing videos btw )
retrogametech Its cool that the fuse is built into the plug, they arent as accessible in most of the systems Im familiar with.
retrogametech Cant believe it was just the plug, what a score.
retrogametech RetroGameTech Since you didnt had the time to reply to my message i send you on your Channel, i go ahead and ask here again.How hard is it actualy to repair Consoles.. because, lets just say, i nearly know nothing and want to jump right into it, not for the gain of money, but to learn something about it.Cheers
retrogametech Lol, people are so fucking dumb.
retrogametech What kind of aching simpleton sells something as faulty without checking the plug? The same sort of field sleeping, tree dwelling, dullard, that just lost a Vectrex for 30 notes. Good God!
retrogametech Man, you got lucky with this purchase lol.
retrogametech No way, they didnt even try and change the fuse? Dumbasses!
retrogametech Very lucky and awesome! I live over in the USA and I have to say the UK plugs are way better then ours, even though they are bigger.
retrogametech Hahaha, I bet the seller is spewing now :PNice work mate, even if it was simple :)
retrogametech Crazy good deal you got there man, Love seeing the consoles being saved from being parted out for no reason.
retrogametech Wow so lucky! Another great video. I want a Vectrex really bad but they are quite expensive normally and I have little space to put it. Hopefully one day! Kind of funny actually, I recently bought an NES with a plug that looks near identical to that one (wires sticking out, a little rusty etc). It will need replaced soon as it doesnt work so good.
retrogametech 35? Thats like, 54? You lucky bastard!
retrogametech Glad to see another video my man! I am actually looking at some model 1 sega cds that say they are broken and try to get one to fix up because I have always wanted a model 1 because they looked so awesome to me back in the day.
retrogametech Try an Atari controller
retrogametech I want a Vectrexxxxxxxxxxxx !
retrogametech What a ridiculous bargain! Great system. Worth getting hold of the home brew version of Thrust.
retrogametech You lucky git :) well done. That must be the buy of the year for you
retrogametech You should buy faulty consoles to repair them and sell them so that their not broken for life!
retrogametech Wow that is amazing dude. Congrats
retrogametech I have never heard of a Vectrex before this video. It was before I was born, is that really so surprising?
retrogametech What a great find and so easy to repair! :)If you are looking for a flash cart check out the VecMulti or Mateos rewriteable Multicart on my channel in case you dont know that stuff already.
retrogametech Nice to see you making vids again. Pm me your address again and I will send you something I know you dont have yet (will need repairing ) and its not another mod chip :)
retrogametech Keep us updated on what happens with this! Controller and games wise!
retrogametech Nice find. Can never quite believe it when eBay sellers cant be bothered to do easy checks on electrical equipment. I bought my Jaguar from someone who assumed it was broken because it didnt light up when you switched it on without a cart in it.
retrogametech NiceandGames did a video about his Vectrex. He got a Time Pilot clone for it that someone made recently. Seemed to be a pretty cool game if you are interested.Also, you cant always trust continuity on fuzes. Sometimes the filament will flex under load and break contact if one side of the filament isnt properly soldered into place anymore. This is definitely a few and far between occurrence, but I thought I would share.
retrogametech That is cheap for a Vectrex. I think this is one of the most interesting things you have fixed I have seen you do not many of these around so the more working the better.
retrogametech Really cool. Ive never actually seen a Vectrex in action, Ive just heard of them. Im pretty sure an Atari joystick will work fine for it if you cant track down an original Vectrex controller.
retrogametech wow you got really lucky there martin
retrogametech Awesome , been waiting for this since you first tweeted about it a while back.I love your videos man you inspire me to take my consoles repair needs into my own hands. Never paying repair fees again.

retrogametech Wow the graphics do look so sharp. That is really cool. Thanks for the upload. If you find a controller, I hope its another Ebay junk, so we can get another repair video.
retrogametech Great find! Wouldnt it be possible to just rewire the extension cord to get other controllers to work instead of directly modifying one? Just a thought, it may not be that easy of a mod or you may have already considered it, but I thought Id suggest it :)
retrogametech Dude, these videos are the best
retrogametech Sweet pickup  easy fix for the win
retrogametech I think they have one of those at the leeds media museum
retrogametech Any day retro uploads a video is a good day.
retrogametech That is a great find, a very cool old console. Im not a collector of this stuff, but watching videos of the Vectrex in the past made me look on eBay to see how much they go for. The answer is a lot so that was a great price you got it for!
retrogametech Thats an awesome console! Please upload some footage when you get a controller working!
retrogametech WOW they didnt check the plug before they sold it?
retrogametech wow you did get a steal. I could but dream of getting something like that and the only thing that was wrong was the power plug. D RetroGameTech
retrogametech Nice vid and a great score. Still, I would not be plugging in 30 year old hardware (especially highvoltage CRT stuff) into the mains without opening it up and inspecting the internals first. You never know what condition the electronics are in after all these years and theres the possibility of permanently damaging something.
retrogametech Wicked motherfucker,westside
retrogametech This game on the Vectrex was the first video game I ever played, so your video brought back some good memories for me. By the way, awesome deal you got there.
retrogametech yaaay you are back :)
retrogametech Another RetroGameTech video? Oh YEAH!
retrogametech Speaking of Vectrex controllers, you might enjoy this little DIY project. Seems to be catching up among Vectrex enthusiasts, given the original light pen is crazy expensive, as is.  bitly1iHY71g
retrogametech Nice videos . please make more
retrogametech Im not envious, honestly !
retrogametech Thanks for the new video Martin. I really enjoyed it as usual. Right after watching this video, I found a Vectrex in great condition, with two controllers, and six games for 125 on Craigslist in my local area. I offered the guy 140 and picked it up at 1:00 AM in the morning. I have gotten a lot of great deals on used consoles and games, but I think this one is probably my best thus far.
retrogametech Theres a couple of videos on Ashens channel about the Vectrex, so that would be a good place to get clued up on what it was and some of the games you can get for it. Wow, hard to believe it was such a simple fix to get it up and running again! Well done!
retrogametech Nice vid man! Keep it up
retrogametech excellent find! Ive always thought the vectrex was a very cool system.
retrogametech The only time Ive ever played one of these was at the Insomnia 49 gaming festival. The camera really doesnt do the display justice. Im assuming its electron beams that make up the shapes, but Im not sure.
retrogametech Good to see a new vid :)
retrogametech Awesome find. Even better, you didnt have to do anything remotely technical to get it up. I was worried the crt was faulty. Glad it was just a neutral lead. lucky score!
retrogametech Amazing find. Great to see a new video from you. Any chance you could do a tutorial on fixing a sega master system model 2 with no power? Ive changed out the voltage regulator but still no luck ( Anyways, thanks for all the informative videos, hope to see more.
retrogametech Great to see you back, Martin! You have been missed!And congratulations on your Vectrex score, with what may be the easiest fix Ive seen you execute yet. :)
retrogametech awesome  as always :)
retrogametech This is awesome. Find it funny that this system was 6 years before I was born so theres my excuse for having never heard of it.
retrogametech Thanks for posting another video, I truly appreciate your effort.
retrogametech A new video at last, Thank you!!!
retrogametech played the same console in game in glasgow a few year ago, hink they were selling it at the time for 80 odd quid, 26 quid is a steal, nice find man :P
retrogametech Wow, people continue to amaze me, what they will sell as faulty. Well at least you were able to take advantage of this deal.
retrogametech I love your videos and your voice!
retrogametech lovely. nice to have you back, matey!
retrogametech Watch out your going to catch the Vectrex bug! I have it and I love the system! You haft to check out all the homebrews for it!! Plus the Vectrex has a amazing library of original games also!!
retrogametech Oh wow, now that is retro!
retrogametech Another great reminder that when it comes to troubleshooting  if you hear hoofbeats, think horses and not zebras.
retrogametech The explosions look kind of like the pulsar map from the golden disc aboard the Voyager Spacecraft.
retrogametech Thats a massive score! What a great price for it! Vectrexes are a collectors wet dream.I have a feeling that possibly the seller deliberately pulled out the neutral pin, to comply with laws on selling vintage equipment. Anyway, great deal. Never sell that, its a goldmine.Recycledgamer Chuck van pelt possibly has some controllers for your system )
retrogametech Those are an impressive set of blue balls.
retrogametech I found something similar for the Pokemon: Mystery Dungeon series. Being A huge fan of all the Mystery Dungeon series I wish I wouldcould have got more. Ive never seen any merch for the Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer branch.
retrogametech Awww man blue balls are the worst!
retrogametech Woo, the day I decide to check his channel for a new video he uploads a new video :D
retrogametech How you got what you wanted in both balls I will never know! :P Great to have you back by the way!
retrogametech I wouldve wanted Shadow, myself.
retrogametech Cool video. Ill have to see if I can find them in the US.
retrogametech Jealous. I wanted the metal sonic. Brother got some from pound shop. He got warehedghog and sonic
retrogametech You must be the only person in known universe to get two out of the two characters you wanted from two blind balls.
retrogametech I found them at The Works, there were only 2 left, the two in this video! :)
retrogametech you are not ashens. but i enjoy your show just the same.
retrogametech NO WAY!!! Im Literally rendering a video in adobe of opening three of these right now....like this vid though dude!
retrogametech yea seen items like this in poundland, pokemon ones though, you can sometimes see what figure you are getting by peeking in the lil holes at the top. Managed to get a complete set of pokemon legendary figures from poundland
retrogametech you really got the two best statues there :D
retrogametech Managed to get the whole set of these in poundworld by peering through the holes lol. You can sort of tell what they are.
retrogametech Thats metal sonic from sonic cd
retrogametech These look pretty cool! Might have to take a trip to the local pound stores. I wouldnt mind knuckles. Knuckles is a pimp.
retrogametech Cool little figures, especially for 1
retrogametech I got Metal, Super, and Knuckles. The three best!
retrogametech Love it, who would of thought you could hold sonics balls in your hand )
retrogametech Unballing. Welcome back.
retrogametech Ive been trying to find one of these for a while, but i dont know what they are called.could you tell me what that blue usb programmer is acutely called
retrogametech Make more videos more frequently plz
retrogametech Im trying not to be a Mr KnowItAll, but that is known as Metal Sonic and first appeared in Sonic CD.
retrogametech I buy my gachas for four hundred yen. Really good quality!
retrogametech What the hell? You jammy git. You only had two  you got both the ones you wanted. Buy a lotto ticket asap.
retrogametech The quality is horrible. And wtf they put werehog Sonic and not Tails?
retrogametech really cool man good to see you back man!
retrogametech well fuck me if you got that lucky getting the 2 you wanted enter a god damn lottery.
retrogametech Stop playing with your balls!!(realizes there are others reading this comment and blows a kiss to all of them)Goodnight everybody! (Hint: its an Animaniacs reference of sorts)
retrogametech wheres the chocolate?
retrogametech did u met with ashens in poundland? :D
retrogametech Finally a new vid glad to see your ok
retrogametech Poundland? Never wouldve expected
retrogametech I like those! I only have one Sonic character set and its Big and Froggy! It takes me to Sonic Adventure everytime I look at Big and his pollywog pal hanging out in their carboard Mystic Ruins!! Froggy where are you! Youre looking kinda weird good buddy whats up with the tail? Hey wait a minute you swallowed my lucky charm!!
retrogametech lol I bought two of these...got x2 knuckles
retrogametech This is odd, but cool at the same time, pretty detailed too.
retrogametech Do you have a need or want for one or two Xbox (Original) Mod chips?One is packaged unused the other is probably FUBAR.
retrogametech Great video man! I was just thinking about doing a review on my channel of this full set  and saw that you beat me to the punch, lol. Great pickups man! Such a cool little set. Keep up the great videos!
retrogametech LOL there sonics balls your holding sonics balls
retrogametech I keep seeing Pokemon ones of these near Coop.
retrogametech lol I bought two of these...got x2 knuckles
retrogametech Could you tell me where exactly u got them from?? Pls..
retrogametech This is odd, but cool at the same time, pretty detailed too.
retrogametech Do you have a need or want for one or two Xbox (Original) Mod chips?One is packaged unused the other is probably FUBAR.
retrogametech Unintentional ASMR video. :3
retrogametech I dont mind about your lack of uploads as when you do upload they are really great quality :D! Keep it up man 3
retrogametech How are you able to find so many AGS101 SPs so easily? Ive had a look for a while, and I cant find many good deals.Either that, or where do you find your 101 screens? My SP 001 has 3 dead pixels, so I wanted to find a new one.Also, my DS lite has a damaged touch screen. It works fine, but its heavily scratched. Ive seen new digitizers for it thats really cheap is that all I need? Or is it something worse than that? If it requires a lot of solder work and stuff, then dont worry, I can live with it. I think I got it a year after it launched, so 2007. (hinge still works great, and apart from some scratches (back, front, touch screen overlay, and two deep scratches on the battery cover, its in great condition!)
retrogametech Welcome back, man!! Its really good to see you making videos again
retrogametech I used to have one of those same GBA movie players. It worked great for about 3 or 4 years, but it died on me.
retrogametech Ive got that same green Lite. I really wanted to get a lime GBC back in the day, but my parents wouldnt let me buy one, so I was really excited when Nintendo later came out with a DS that was about the same color. Im thinking of buying a broken black one for the buttons to make it look even more like a GBC.Could you buy it individually in the UK, or did you have to buy a bundle set to get it like we did in America?
retrogametech I had a GBA MoviePlayer... you could flash alternate firmware on it to play homebrew before flashcarts existed.
retrogametech dont stop man  i love your vids  1 fan
retrogametech Do you want the grape gbc for the lime one because I have most my computer systems in a sade of green
retrogametech Aww Yea RetroGameTech is back :D. I hope you had great holidays and a happy new year. Also do you know where to get GBA Micro faceplates from?
retrogametech Great video once again! I have a scratched GBA SP (101) and want to change the casaechassis to an NES style one (the white one with dark purple buttons)
retrogametech So, have you found that Gamebox DS yet?
retrogametech Hey martin great to see you back on youtube! happy new year to you too bro:)awesome box of handhelds!  only psp 3ds and gameboy color in my collection:)hopefully you get some time soon to kick back and relax from working so hard!google plus sucks! bro but were all here enjoying your videos! keep going !! you help keep my interest in gaming going :)
retrogametech Good to see you back mate
retrogametech Always good to see a new video from you!
retrogametech Awesome to see youre back making vids man, I really enjoy them.
retrogametech Love them black GBAs and SPS
retrogametech I love the gameboy micro. Its screen is so nice and size just makes it probably one of the best handhelds. Good to see you back!
retrogametech I never tire of this mellow flow Martin has.
retrogametech Love the videos! Out of curiosity where did you buy your premodded GBA?
retrogametech Man, Gameboy Color still looks sexy till this day, I want one :(
retrogametech Nice to see you back! I really enjoy your vids, I stumbled about them kinda accidently when looking for a video on how to replace batteries in gbc games but after watching some of your stuff i decided to stay :D
retrogametech Hi there.. Where are you from actually?? Uk??
retrogametech Great to have you back and best of luck with the new job!
retrogametech Happy New Year to you Martin. Good to hear from you!Keep making videos...YouTube will more than likely change to something even NEWER AND BETTER..soon enough....lol
retrogametech man, you really hav a lot of gba sps OO :D
retrogametech 2014 room tour is in order :D
retrogametech I look forward to guys like you and lukemorse1 the most ! missed the vids !
retrogametech I collect Japanese games that either didnt see a release outside of Japan, or just games I want to know the localization differences in. And I buy a lot of faulty games that just turn out to be dead internal batteries. I bought a collection of the original Pocket Monsters games for 15, it came with the original 6 and they all just needed a battery replacement.
retrogametech Great video mate, nice to see you back :)
retrogametech Hey man , you r number 1 on my list ! You r douing grayt stuf , you r explicit  logical ......... goo on , You got style . Thums up !
retrogametech Good to see you back mate! Ive missed my dose of awesome hardware mods : )
retrogametech I wasnt too impressed with the forced google integration myself, but I suppose Ive gotten used to it now. And to give credit to them, the notification bell at the top right is a good was of seeing if there are any replies to comments made.The GBA mod sounds interesting, swapping the screen over and changing out the trigger buttons.I remember a mate having that GBA movie cartridge, or at least a similar unit, must have been back in 02 or 03. That guy always was ahead of the curve, his imported DS was what convinced me to pick on up myself. I got a Japanese DS from a UK seller in January 05, a couple of months before the UK launch.
retrogametech With the direction things have taken considering countless DLCs, releasing unfinished games, have to pay for online services it makes me miss the good old days when you tossed a game in and had fun. I dont have anywhere near the collection you do but I do have most of the older systems I grew up on starting with intellivision and Atari Great channel I enjoying seeing all of the different systems
retrogametech You have one of the best channels around. Glad to see you are back )
retrogametech Ive been wanting to try and do a backlight mod on my own original GBA as well and seeing how good it looks in this video just makes me want to do it even more.But since Im currently in Tokyo and havent gotten my own GBA around it will still be a while before I can get around and attempt it (been looking around over here for an SP 101 in advance, but havent had the luck to find one, then again I havent been looking around that much).
retrogametech not sure if you will see this but do you have a neo geo pocketpocket color? if not you might want to have a look at them they look really fun although there isnt a huge library i think only around 80 games? and a lot of fighting games. I like collecting handhelds as well although my collection isnt nearly as good as yours
retrogametech can anyone tell me if it is worth getting a psp go?
retrogametech Wow thats a great collection of handhelds. I must get the Gameboy advance my kids had one back in the day but not a mod one. Great vid mate.
retrogametech I love your videos. I have a dingoo and love it but the shoulder buttons on it suck and I love the gameboy advances design so I want to merge the two. Ive done some mods in the past nothing too complicated but I have soldering experience from this and school and whatnot so that is not an issue. Any tips or tricks you could give me before I embark? And anywhere you know of that sells just the gba shell or a like 3rd party shell with buttons not just a case? Any help is...helpful.
retrogametech Soon as they are available in France
retrogametech Subbed for your great content, cheers!
retrogametech Nice to see you back Martin. :)
retrogametech Slacker!! Thanks for showing us your big box...
retrogametech hey retro good video, by curiosity i have a question top ask you, have you ever done a dual nub mod on a psp? like so he can see this :D
retrogametech Soon as they are available in France
retrogametech Subbed for your great content, cheers!
retrogametech Nice to see you back Martin. :)
retrogametech I hate this new comment system! GO TO HELL GOOGLE
retrogametech Its like looking through a box of memories from past videos! Great to see youre back, hope you had a good New Year! Sometimes its nice to take a break from YouTube.
retrogametech Ahhh, the old Nokia Ngage.. I was one of the suckers who bought this on release with Tom Raider. Game did play well but boy making calls was just ridiculous.Bought a Xperia Play and for emulators it was a decent little phone.
retrogametech Found and got it! For 25 US dollars or 15 british pounds!!! Didnt get the charger but I got a great deal!
retrogametech Ah dude its good tae see ye back on here :)
retrogametech Hi i have been subbed for a while now and really enjoy your videos about the strange and interesting things you find keep up good work
retrogametech hi mate keep up the good work and very nice collection of retro handhelds love watching your videos mate also from scotland myself in glasgow mate
retrogametech I like ur videos brother keep them coming
retrogametech Glad to see youre able to make some new videos! You got me into collecting more games and I enjoy seeing the new stuff you pick up. Let me know if you ever want to trade from someone in the US.
retrogametech Omg he has the talk o phone
retrogametech Hey what hard shell case are you using for your back lit modded GBA? (The black one). Ive got a backlit GBA and am really needing a hard carrying case for it and that one looks perfect. What brand is it?
retrogametech another great vid man ! , you must keep going !.Down here in Nz there is little to no retro market you have inspired me to start one !
retrogametech Welcome back! Also nice shoelace pattern.
retrogametech Hey Martin, Hope all is well man. Happy New Year. Excellent collection there. Awesome! You really know how to take care of your collection. Great stuff..:
retrogametech loved the box of goodies..and good too know your alive and well..would like too see you modding the original xbox or lift the lid on your bad boys you already have and maybe a walk thru of the process . i have a modded one and now its showing error code 21 ..i have looked at the forums on alot of sites and read till my eyes are blurry i just dont understand all the jargen..if you would be so kind too do a video man it would help this old boy out .thanks and happy new year lol
retrogametech good vid mate, love the vids )
retrogametech Glad your back, your videos are very interesting. Hopefully we can get more eBay junk repair videos too as I find those very educational and interesting to watch.Keep the good work up!
retrogametech I like the glacier original GBA very much! It is a solid and beaitiful thing and mine is mint! I only play it in summer I wonder why!! I would like to mod it some day like yours I dont like the SP as much.
retrogametech Great to see you back.
retrogametech i also am a hardware collector. i like putting use to consoles that have been forgotten and neglected by others. but i do limit myself to one of each model and colour. Ive got one of each game boy color, except for the limited ones like the pokemon exclusive.
retrogametech such a brilliant collection! im soooo jealous! :D
retrogametech Glad to see you again,I was wondering if you could do your own version of a nintoaster tutorial
retrogametech Yea theres a good chance your comments will be ghosted if your account isnt quality enough. Just posting too much can effectively silent ban you, Im pretty sure this post wont show up.
retrogametech Glad to see you are back man :D I missed your cool accent lol
retrogametech Great to see you back and posting great vids. Hope you decide to continue.
retrogametech Top video martin. Congratulations on the new job. Top channel, top videos, top lad.
retrogametech glad to see you back man, ive missed your videos.Cant wait till you do the gba shoulder button mod! been trying to do some mods myself and thats something i would definitely like to do as well.
retrogametech You have some good old consoles, thats really cool.I do wonder if you play old DOS games like Doom, or Command  Conquer: Red Alert on some old DOS computers.If you do play some old games on old computers, I hope that one day you could some videos about it.If not then you should try it, old computers from the 1990s are really cheap..
retrogametech i think i saw an ngage game at playnation games in croydon, london but cant remember which one though
retrogametech Yes! YES! Glad to have ya back, Martin.
retrogametech Welcome back. Look forward to what youve got to share in the future!
retrogametech Love your vids and think its great how you share your passion with us and love that you dont sell out as a lot of you tubers do by excepting gifts or try selling shirts ect keep up the good work :)
retrogametech 17:00 if we rob Martins House, AGS101 will be rare.
retrogametech I missed you, glad your back. Google really needs to give up and just let Facebook have the social network crown.
retrogametech pretty awesome there man! thanks for that little shout out there as well :) my game selection isnt anything compared to others out there but so it goes eh. I have to say that I am also a huge fan of the ridge racer games myself. Trying to get my ridge racer 5 arcade up and running but it is going to need some other parts to get going. wow, sudden end there at the end but great vid man.
retrogametech Intresting, I like videos about retro collections:)
retrogametech very cool. im very appreciative of the special guy who sorted me out with a GBA SD cart, i havent even begun to scratch the surface of the games on that thing, but i know itll last me a very, very long time. big love to that guy. :)
retrogametech Is that limited edition GBA the 1001 model (backlit)? looks awesome. Have yet to track down a decent priced one of those.
retrogametech When you backup your saves and use them on an Emulator you can use cheats vs having to find A working cheating device and codes.
retrogametech Awesome, I wana get one now man! Great stuff man
retrogametech I seriously need to get one of those now.
retrogametech Glad you found what you needed mate.
retrogametech glad to see one channel that isnt getting spammed by the bobs army bullshit. and great job getting the smart card to work!
retrogametech Make sure you backup the software for these devices. Just in case the download links go dead. Happened to me in the past with old softwares.
retrogametech ah you found the software great :)
retrogametech Glad you got it working, should be a handy tool for you to play about with.
retrogametech Wouldnt it be cool if there was the ultimate hybrid! It has a ROM dumper box thing and features of the EZFlash4 with no need for patching and the cartridge has a built in DS card for DS action and also works on the 3DS! As a bonus you could pop your DS games into the GBA cart which then plugged into the reader for DS dumps! Ohh and the DS cart has an SD card so you can replace it if it burns out or you flash it too many times :D
retrogametech Hey man Love your channel! Games, circuitry, bargain finds and more.Why should we watch anything else! : )
retrogametech Thanks for sharing this! Does anyone know which and where can I buy a devices that I can use to backup GB, GBC, and GBA saves, so that I can change the battery and dump them inside of them again? I cant find any with a good price tag that ship to Europe (Malta)
retrogametech I cant stand a month without your video!
retrogametech Dumbed a few games, didnt take long to run into harddrive space issues
retrogametech Awesome you got it working! Youtube is filled with great helpful people :)
retrogametech Nice little tool you got there. Bet it was good finding the drivers etc.
retrogametech Cool. I was thinking about a side project to do one day, hacking into a GBA, and replacing the insides with Android hardware, to have an ultra emulator with other functions, I have a DS with emulators but its the original and its not sleek or small.
retrogametech Does it auto detect the save type of games that have saves if youre trying to dump them or do you have to look it up online andor guess?
retrogametech Make a new video please!!!
retrogametech Was there any games on the flash cart? That would have been an added bonus.
retrogametech When are u gonna make a new vid?
retrogametech Hello. Ive tried to contact you with a request, but i can not untill you add me to contacts. If you are into commission work, please add me to your contacts and we can discuss my request.Thanks and regards,grimm
retrogametech think that is 128 megabytes not 128 megabit. think might be able to fit like every gba game on that thing.
retrogametech can you tell me what hardware you exactly used on the video and what to search for on e bay (etc.)?would be really nice!because I dont know what to search for ( I tried but found nothing )
retrogametech You have the same Netbook as me!  Are you running XP or 7 on yours?  Do you have wireless card issues?
retrogametech Does dumps piratebootleg games?
retrogametech Sweet, thanks for sharing this.
retrogametech Great news....your last vid inspired me to get my old ez flash 2 cart working and I used an old laptop and now run xp on it....playing wario ware and GTA on my micro has been great fun...keep up the great work with these videos.....
retrogametech Love the videos Martin! Really look forward to watching them :) Also, what was that game you said that didnt work too well on the Flashcard?
retrogametech anyone know where i can buy one of these fuckers?
retrogametech Hello Where do you but the usb flash card ???? i need one where can i buy it !
retrogametech The atari cartridge I made is just 128KB which is 1000 times smaller than that gba cart. It can hold 32 games though. Atari2600 games are only 4K each.
retrogametech Does the GBWriter also read gameboycolour games?
retrogametech yay! you found it im going to try to watch most of your 231 vidios .
retrogametech Glad you got it working! Id be pretty interesting in this for backing up save files! My sis accidentally deleted my save of Sonic Battle years ago, so I just let her use my cart, but since then shes gotten her own. Would love to copy her save back to hers and start over again. :)Does GBWriter support dumping GBC and GB saves as well?
retrogametech Why do you have windows XP
retrogametech Yah you found the software. Thats really cool!
retrogametech Where are you? I miss your videos!
retrogametech Dude almost a month without a video I need my retro fix )
retrogametech Ive been trying to find one of these for a while, but i dont know what they are called.could you tell me what that blue usb programmer is called
retrogametech That machine is awesome!! I guess that little box of magic is where all our ROMs come from!
retrogametech you like cant find it any were i tryed amazon ebay and cregslist it is not there
retrogametech So, i recently sold my flashcard to a friend who only have a win 7 computer. the software works fine except, the drivers dont seem to work since his computer wont find the device. anyone have any leads?
retrogametech This may be immature, but i laughed every time you said dump
retrogametech Do they have this for n64?
retrogametech I got a mega old Flash cart that links to a PC via a daisy chain, also one that only saves save files :SI might have the files to my one somewhere, but have you looked on codejunkies at all? The Datel versions of USB software often works with these flash devices!
retrogametech I have a similar flash cart but its serial port. I find it better than the sd card one I have as it has no slowdown in games and they dont need patching. but its been flashed for ever with a castlevania rom since I dont have serial port any more
retrogametech I always check to see if youve uploaded something on my break at work and found this has just gone up! Its about the GBA, too, Fantastic!
retrogametech Have you tried it in Linux? Its possible Linux might just recognize it as removable storage.
retrogametech When you do get it sorted, please do a video of it all working. Seems really interesting.
retrogametech Looks the same as EZflash 1 I still own I have the software if you want to try it give me a note and i see if i can upload it for you later on
retrogametech great video, i still have my super card for the gba. but still want to find one for the GB that holds more than 2mb haha
retrogametech Theres a very similar item currently on eBay here: http:www.ebay.co.ukitmEZFLASHII512MbForGBAGBASP161143074189?ptUKChargersDockshashitem2584e02d8dlooks like a different version of the same item. But its boxed, so it could well come with a software disc.
retrogametech How do you go about fixing game carts, any ideas anyone?
retrogametech awesome stuffs, i wana get a smart card for my gameboy soon :)
retrogametech You could try to look up the VID  PID of the USB Device once its connected (even without drivers) ... it should look something like this : USBVID0403PID6001REV0600 Just try to google some of the numbers the device will show in the settings.
retrogametech Where do you get an ezflash cart?!
retrogametech Check out GBAtemp.net. Thats where I get all my firmware for my ds flash carts.
retrogametech This is the only lead I could find.http:www.gameboyadvance.netfalsoftflashadvancesoftware.htm
retrogametech Fingers crossed for you finding drivers, would definitely be useful backing up saves and maybe even getting saves online with all characters unlocked etc.
retrogametech Nice! Ive always been looking for a flashcart, but honestly none seem very good. The EZ looks OK, but is really a bit too expensive...
retrogametech Ive been watching your channel for wile now and really enjoy your content i also know your probably the best person i should be asking this to.I really want to get my original gameboy fitted with a back light and new top screen, ive looked into doing this myself but it looks far to complicated for me i would end up breaking it :) now i know you did a video a wile ago showing how to do this yourself but i was wondering do you know of anywhere or anyone i could send mine to? ive looked everywhere and cant find anyone offering to this.I know its a long shot but figured if anyone would know you would.Take care
retrogametech Hey man. On our regional gbforum there was once an article about this smart card. The software to it is called: GBWRITER  you should easily find it on google.
retrogametech pm me i have the softwear bad thing is it only works on xp
retrogametech OK, ill get searching. I think it IS megabits, its a GBA so bits is most likely.Some good stuff on German site reinerziegler
retrogametech http:www.emuzone.netgbaspgbaflashcards.htm try this site. they seem to have pictures and links to more than a dozen software and hardware combos.
retrogametech I picked up an old Atari 400 from an old lady. It doesnt power on and I have tested the PSU to ensure its functioning how can I go about troubleshooting the circuit board? Many thanks.
retrogametech This might be what youre looking for.Heres the link:How to install drivers for Gameboy GB USB smart card 64m on 64 bit windows 7
retrogametech Left a comment on your channels discussion page with some possible links. Best of luck!
retrogametech http:www.goodylands.comF2AUDLS.htmlhttp:www.goodylands.comUSBWDLS.htmlhttp:www.goodylands.comSCFDLS.htmlTry those mate, if those dont work, post the vendor and part ID, and ill have a ganders.
retrogametech This site references several smart cards and custom made stuff. I didnt see that specific card, but maybe you could find it looking for related cards?http:www.reinerziegler.deGBAgba.htm
retrogametech I wouldnt call that an early flash card. Since it uses USB, it isnt. Early ones used parallel port. If the USB on that one works good, then it would be fairly late on. The USB attachment I have for the Bung card doesnt work very well.
retrogametech Do you have the EZ FLash software? I have one but I cant find it anywhere and I have one laying around. Thanks!
retrogametech Whats your favourite console
retrogametech I think I might have found something:http:mynewdata.tripod.comsoftware.htmXlinker V4.0 looks like it might be worth a shot.
retrogametech RetroGameTech  Heres the IT Technicians way of locating drivers, seeming I am one myself. :)Go to Run  Type devmgmt.msc  Find the device under the device manager  right click and select properties  Click the Details tab at the top of the window  In the drop down box and select Hardware Ids  The box below will show something like dev0000 ven0000. Once you have the Device and Vendor IDs, head over to http:pcidatabase.com and enter those two numbers into their website and it will tell you exactly what your device is and the website of the manufacturer where you can download drivers from. This may not help you solve your issue, but it may give you a few clues on where to look.By the way, if the hardware id comes up as something like: USBVID177FPID0250, just search those two numbers in Google and that should give you an idea on where to look as well.
retrogametech Where can I buy ds flash carts from
retrogametech That is an ez flash 4 i have the same one, great little thing.
retrogametech It looks similar to the Ez flash II flash card powerstar, Have you tried the Ez flash Client?
retrogametech You wont believe this, but I actually have one of those in here somewhere. Ill look it out and see if the disc is in with it.
retrogametech just watched your video.please ask youtuber lukemorse1,he does retro stuff.he is a american that now lives in japan.plus he does mvssnkmotherboards referbs and many other retro systemsgames for his own collection like you.i follow both of you.great channel.:)
retrogametech Where can i get one of these nowadays?
retrogametech i think this is the site http:gbwriter.software.informer.com and how much did u pay for the ez flash?
retrogametech http:filetrip.netndsdownloadsflashcartfilesdownloadewinclient072f3383.htmlhere is the client for the smart card, it also contains the driver as well
retrogametech Hey this is exactly how my atari2600 backup cartridge works. I made a readerwriter that connects to the pc which allows me to save digital copies of all of my 2600 games and then put any game on the battery backed ram cartridge. I was wondering if something similar existed for other systems and you just showed me the gba has such a device made for it. Thanks for sharing!
retrogametech hey boss try this site http:www.ezfadvance.com
retrogametech Hi martin, Im looking to get an ez flash cart but cant seem to find one, any advice?
retrogametech were did you get the ez flash thing i have ben looking every were for some thing like that can i have yours pleaseeeees i will show you some cool things like get a gameboy player and play it on a gamecube
retrogametech Have you ever had any experience with an R4i Card for the 3ds, Im looking into buying one, any opinions?
retrogametech This is info about CyberDragon : http:danefirm.favore.plphcyberdragonrobertseredyniecki,3045205.html They are located in Poland, they are selling electronic stuff . there is email biurocyberdragon.pl but I am not sure if they will understand engilsh, i can translate it for you if you will write it in eng.
retrogametech Dude you could Theoretically dump a rom with that.
retrogametech try this: http:store.kitschbent.comproductusb64msmartcardthere are links there
retrogametech You might to find info about EZFlash IIIt uses exactly the same software compared to what you have there.I have a EZFlash II myself, my research (and action) showed me that the dated software DOES NOT work with Windows Vista and up.Use Windows XP or less, and the computer recognizes the hardware (and within the program).It is a pain to load on it, but once games are inside, they load and play exactly as if it is an original gamecart.I hope this helps you out, need more help I could try to find out more.PS..: protip, sometimes through Archive.org old sites can be accessed (including their links to software) in the catacombs of the internet P
retrogametech Just google : Ewin Client 0.72 Download , first link.
retrogametech Where did you get the ez flash IV from? i only found one on ebay for 85?? o.0
retrogametech http:www.hkems.comdownload2020Transferer2012.htmDid some looking around, and found some similar software that might just be compatible. I have no idea, but I guess you could try it out.Keep up the good work on the videos!
retrogametech Hey there Martin, I have a cart which seems to be the exact same as the one you got there  only the stickers different. The SW package that came with it weighs in at 6MB, let me know if you want me to upload it somewhere.
retrogametech i want one of the gba flash carts really bad
retrogametech I remember having something like this but the box that plugged into the PC used a serial port xD If I remember correctly I used some sort of FTP like software to flash games to it using Windows ME.(Also this is shockwave952s other account. I would comment with shockwave952 but Ive been locked out of the comment section for not linking with G, sigh...)
retrogametech i dont think it came with any software originally i found a website:http:www.madeinchina.comshowroomwangwei198019productdetailCqonEMuTsxliChinaSmartCardFrw1861s.html
retrogametech I have 2 256MB Flash2Advance cards from years ago but dont have a clue how to copied roms onto them, i completely forgot how to do it :(
retrogametech Have you tried GBWriter? Going way way way down the google rabbithole I found an old post in Polish that says that the EZ Flash Advance II and the Smart Card II (which this is) are the same cartridge and use GBWriter. At the time, the software for this came on a minicd in a separate package that had to be bought separately(!), I found a photo of it, not that thats any use.
retrogametech I used to have one of these, but I dont have any of the software. Sorry. It came on a miniCD disc, so maybe the seller might have the disc or something.
retrogametech Heres a site focusing on flashcarts and other related material for the GB, GBC, and GBA. http:www.reinerziegler.deGBAgba.htmDidnt see your flashcart, but maybe searching using related carts will turn something up?
retrogametech http:www.mediafire.comdownload40yrylf0sq3msduewin0.66.rarThat should be it...
retrogametech Good luck mate, going to be tricky to find software for it. I have one of the old Flash2Advance carts which is now totally useless as no PC I own has a serial port for transferring software to it. In the end I went with one of those EZ Flash IV carts, I remember asking you about that ages ago (but I had my inbox set to contacts only! doh!!).
retrogametech I have a super card mini sd for my gba it works pretty well no real software needed really just pop in roms and play. Only supports up to 2gb though. But its kinda hard to find now I think cause the website I got it from sold out already. Should check it out. Its clear purple and has a cool storm trooper picture on it.
retrogametech I like my EZFlashIV until I discovered the other week you have to patch the damn games using some weird Chinese program that doesnt exist for Mac! I completely forgot you had to do that!!
retrogametech Oh wait, just realised you can post links in these comments now!Hey man, Its a long shot but here is a few sites that may have what youre looking for:http:mynewdata.tripod.comsoftware.htmhttp:www.hkems.comdownload2020Transferer2012.htmI dont have one myself to test any of this but hopefully you find what youre looking for. Thanks for the great uploads, always enjoy your videos!Best of luck,Sean.
retrogametech Whats the gbc one called
retrogametech wait i found it this is the site to buy it from http:www.goodylands.comG13a1.html it says you can download the driver from there site
retrogametech Check this out http:gbatemp.netthreadssmartcard256mbgbwriter.35407
retrogametech Looking at the packaging for the Smart Card and a few posts in Spanish, it seems like it never came with the software in the packaging. Theres people going back as far as 2004 looking for the software..
retrogametech Can you make a tutorial for the homemade gbc cart?
retrogametech Did you tried EZ flash 2 client software? I remember at the time they used to work with most flash cards. I have two of those till this day, unfortunaly they dont work anymore (
retrogametech Nvm Im dumb. I just realized you already did that
retrogametech I still have the software by the way, and some of the older revisions, as they could cause problem with certain games sometimes
retrogametech Strider games are good ones to pick up these days. the PS1 strider 2 goes for 4080 and not many are around. with the new Strider coming out prices and demand might keep going up.
retrogametech Ah Strider 2 (or Strider returns in this case) the infamous game that wasnt made by capcom but by US Gold (which is a british company for some reason) for the strider series. :P
retrogametech The back of strider 2 has korean on it im learning it :)
retrogametech I think the label on Strider II is Korean, but I dont know
retrogametech Fire Shark kind of reminds me a bit of Empire of Steel from a top down perspective
retrogametech Thanks for the shout Martin, glad you like the bootlegs thought they might go nicely with your scorpion etc! Tbh I havent really given Strider 2 much time, only tested it but I love the two shmups, I couldnt tell the difference between those and the originals.
retrogametech This is the most Hyeper Neo game I have ever seen.
retrogametech Yeah Martin, That is Korean.
retrogametech The Hyper Neo 64 deserved more games than it got.
retrogametech Buriki one is better than you think, its actually very good once you get used to the controls. good luck finding samsho 64,awesome game aswell :)
retrogametech You cry me.... i hope those games from Hyper Neogeo 64 really soon fixed on MAME.Im really enjoying your videos.A note: Strider 2 sticker from the back is not chinese, is korean. :D
retrogametech The language was koreanm
retrogametech The writing on the back of the cart is Korean not Chinese
retrogametech Lol, thats Korean on the back of the strider game.
retrogametech hey i have a few broken game systems, if you want to trade or anything let me know
retrogametech the strider 2 game is supposed to play like that with a lag so its not any kind of problem with the game
retrogametech The language is Korean I think seeing some of the symbols before on noodles and stuff.
retrogametech SNK Arcade kill me just how big they are lol!
retrogametech You show it with your SLG.
retrogametech Thats Hangul on that box aka Korean
retrogametech Thats korean on the back of strider 2
retrogametech thats actually korean
retrogametech Mega Drive bootleg bonuses are the best bootleg bonuses going.
retrogametech It wouldnt let me comment until I upgraded my account to use Google, this is seriously annoying.. Anyway, the language on the back of the Strider 2 cartridge is Korean. Any time you see characters that look like space invaders spaghetti hoops with all the circles and straight lines its Korean.
retrogametech Aero the Acrobat is on the Sega Genesis too.
retrogametech Ive been on a game boy kick also! i just got gunstar super heroes in the mail today :D. love your channel!
retrogametech i think watching your videos gave me ebay luck or something crazy i got an awesome deal on a fully boxed Perfect Dark on the n64 book and everything amazing condition for 15 by far the best deal i have ever seen on ebay i userally see boxed PDs go for 30 Oo
retrogametech Yeah, it looks like it should be good but theres something just a little off with the game. Kinda sad.
retrogametech I just bought zero mission today. Im so sad I ever sold it in the first place. I always kept fusion because that was my favorite but in all it seems zero mission is the more sought after one.
retrogametech I have a multi cart for the Game Boy Advance. My one is 118 in 1.
retrogametech So true! It has a lot of amaziong 2D titles. Its library is sort of how I wished video games had progressed after the SNESMD era. Heavy on the 2D pixel art with detailed sprites  environments and smooth animations. But instead we got 3D polygon ugliness on hardware that wasnt quite ready for it.
retrogametech GBA was great for old arcade ports :)
retrogametech Lol, you always say this but Ive been uploading every few days. :P
retrogametech Pretty much, I ended up stupidly trading spyro early on, no idea what happened to the Harry Potter 4 and Penguins game I got with my original SP. Back then I didnt have much money so I just stuck to what I knew. Ive had more GameBoy  GameBoy color games than I can count. Most of them I could never figure out or get into. The Pokemon games were repetitive as hell but at least I could beat them. I could tell you A lot of good NDS games though.
retrogametech I never get tired of GBA. I play mine more than my DS.
retrogametech Glad you liked it! I also figured out how to improve the video quality for next time :)
retrogametech See the main issue I have is not the fact the bootleg is a bootleg but if your good at making a bootleg then make one that works
retrogametech Golden Sun, Golden Sun The lost Age, NeedForSpeedUnderground, Spyro Season Ice, Catz, Pokemon Saphire, Pokemon Mystery dungeon, Ecks Sever II Ballistic :D and for DS check DragonQuest :D
retrogametech I have the lilo and stitch 2 game and never played it but i will now. I love metal slug and the lilo and stitch games look great.
retrogametech I got that zero mission bootleg too. The seller did not even mention it was fake. If you know what to look for its quite easy to spot a fake though. I am trying to get a complete metroid collection, so Id have to hunt down a real one.
retrogametech I think people overlook the Lilo and Stitch games because they assume they are kids games. More people should base their opinion on game play.
retrogametech Gah... dont buy bootlegs... and avoid Hong Kong sellers
retrogametech Thanks for the tip, Ill check it out :)
retrogametech Do you have any of the pirate multi carts for the GBA? I have a few of them in my collection, kinda obsessed with bootleg stuff. Would be good to see a video if you have any.
retrogametech Metroid Fusion is by far my favourite GBA game.
retrogametech Ive got a DS one that proudly says 168 games NO REPEAT!! on it. Theyre all NES games in a DS emulator  if you press the shoulder buttons the emulators menu pops up :) The best one Ive got is the 32inone GB cart that has such nonhits as Tom  Rat, Violent Bump and Swiftly Hop. Its weird because theres 6 real games, the rest are duplicates... but with no hacks in the duplicates.
retrogametech You know, (you probably get this a lot) but whenever i see a video from you, whatever it may be, it brightens my day up. i just love your videos, dude. thank you for making them :D
retrogametech Its definitely worth a lookdownload :)
retrogametech Passed me by too. But picked one up from Gamestation for 5 a few years back and Ive been hooked ever since :). Its really surprising to me how broad and massive its library is. Im starting to put together a hidden gems vid highlighting some of the better titles.
retrogametech Thanks dude. Dont think LPs are really for me tbh. And theres so many people doing them these days! haha. Loads of great channels already dedicated to the subject  I think you really need a certain type of personality to pull it off without boring the crap outta people :P
retrogametech Fucking love your videos. Please keep doing them.
retrogametech Not to sound weird but one of the main reasons why I like your videos is because you have a calm speaking voice, did you get my message about the android mini pcs? I think youd like them
retrogametech Seems to be the case for quite a few games on the system. AstroBoy, Lady Sia and Santa C Jr are a few others that usually get overlooked.
retrogametech I like the new format! It makes more sense than the old one.
retrogametech Man, I really need to get back into Gameboy Advanced... WHERE ARE MY GAMECUBE CABLES!!
retrogametech DO MORE EBAY PROJECTS!! I love watching them, practically making me want to go out and buy gameboys and stuff to repair! (probably am going to). Just need to do research on systems. Hope you read this
retrogametech grate vids dude keep them up :D
retrogametech Ive got quite a few yeah :) . Im hoping to do a full collection vid sometime soon so Ill show them all there.
retrogametech great vid, im a massive gba fan, its the only system i collect for, people dont seem to realise how many amazing games there are
retrogametech Sadly the zero mission game in the picture was just a picture he took from the internet. I have seen some sellers put up pictures of a game showing the nintendo logo on the pcb. I really appreciate that.
retrogametech I recently bought an original Nintendo DS on eBay for around 6. Seller was convinced that the system was broken beyond repair, turned out it was just out of charge. Basically it was a steal
retrogametech Hey Rob! This is one of the first Lego games Ive played and I was pleasantly surprised :) . Ill be keeping an eye out for others.
retrogametech The second Lilo  Stitch game is what I expected the first to be, some form of platformer.
retrogametech Youre right i am too greedy with your videos, i just really enjoy them.
retrogametech my favourite gba games where the castlevania games, especially circle of the moon and aria of sorrow oh and the fzero games, the mario kart and gt advance 12 where also great racing games on the system )
retrogametech Finally a new video :D
retrogametech I think the picture in picture was a good idea. Another great video. Thanks for sharing.
retrogametech I never had a GBA, been thinking about picking one up, I have two games that I used to play on my DS, Gunstar Future Heroes and Sword of Mana. Both great and fairly uncommon I think? Not sure but I think theyre worth a bit of money still.
retrogametech Glad to see youre doing more videos. You should start doing Lets play series.
retrogametech I love my GBA. Got screen light mod and I play FZero on it. Loving micro machines.
retrogametech Cool, well Im already working on it so hopefully you wont have to wait too long. :)
retrogametech Thanks, and already working on it )
retrogametech Never heard of it. Ill check it out, thanks!
retrogametech Man, I love your videos :D
retrogametech That top hidden gems sounds like a great idea!
retrogametech I wasnt really playing it, just randomly messing about to capture footage for this vid :P
retrogametech There are tons of great games you should check out. Im going to try and put together a couple of videos on the subject in the coming week :) .
retrogametech Thanks. Already working on the hidden gems vid :)
retrogametech Pickup videos arent as good when you dont tell us how much you paid for them, and its not much of a pickup video when you pay the average price (ebay).
retrogametech Cool, Ill check out that Madagascar Penguins game. Mostly just Pokemon on the GBA for you then Im guessing? haha
retrogametech No way!, I love bootlegs! Haha. Ive been building up a nice little collection of them over the last few months. You can find some really weird ROM hacks and cool cartridge art.
retrogametech I really enjoyed the new format, it makes the video much more enjoyable to watch, not that it wasnt already of course!
retrogametech top 20 hidden gems sounds like a really good idea!
retrogametech The games I enjoy collecting are those 32 in one pirate carts. Prices of carts take the pss.
retrogametech Yeah, those are always pretty funny. Ive got a few of them. Some have crazy ROM hacks of NES games on them XD
retrogametech Great video, I really need to grab a GBA, I keep hoping to grab a GBA SP NES edition but nothing at a good price as of yet. I would just buy it for Micro Machines to be honest lol. What software do you use to edit your videos?
retrogametech Would defiantly be interested in a best ofhidden gems video, the GBA is a system that passed me by. I got a few when I bought my original DS, but thats about it.
retrogametech Haha, nice! Love those types of bargains!
retrogametech ooh didnt even know micro machines was on GBA.. i bet that feels perfect for a handheld game great selection of games here.. good ole GBA :)
retrogametech Thanks! Im going to try and up the capture footage for next time.
retrogametech How you spoil us with all these videos :D
retrogametech awesome dude:) def pick some of them up had soo many hours of fun with them! many adult gamers enjoy them too:) i used think they were just for kids but after playing some at my nephews i was blown away at how good they are! i look forward to know if you pick some up in your vids:)
retrogametech awesome vidoes would like to see how your devices (cart gamesemulators) are setup!
retrogametech I totally agree! And the games are (mostly) very cheap as a result. :)
retrogametech Lego games are awesome:) i own nearly all the lego 360 games ! great fun great puzzles and all have a comical side to them too :) lego lotr is my fav so far:) keep up the great work dude :) rob:)
retrogametech Thanks, appreciate it!
retrogametech Hey RetroGameTech: one game for the GBA I would recommend is Rayman Raving Rabbids: its got really bad ratings but is incredibly fun to play, I really enjoyed finishing the game, and the only letdown was the ending... Thanks for yet another great video )
retrogametech Only recently started on GBA stuff after a 20 year obsession with the DMGs will have to keep my eye out for those CT games, they look pretty cool.
retrogametech Lilo and Stitch was my first GBA game, when it was new. Fiendishly difficult when youre about 67! (as a side note my first PS2 game was Dark Chronicle: my parents seemed to like buying me obscure games).
retrogametech Yup, and I play em on my Gamecube with the GBA adapter, on a Commodore monitor... looks great!
retrogametech The Madagascar Penguins game on GBA is one of the few platformers I ever liked. Theres also the Spyro season of Fire I think it is thats really good.
retrogametech Really liked how you did video on the side for gameplay,I hope you keep doing it.
retrogametech big mutha truckers seems to run about as good as the real version from videos i seen. it is better then the cruisn exotica on gbc i had.
retrogametech In Jurrasic Park you have to connect the shops to a path not the road.
retrogametech I understand that Microsofts decision to name it the Xbox One is stupid, but that doesnt mean you can just reject it haha. The original Xbox IS just called the Xbox, and the new one IS called Xbox One.
retrogametech How do you connect all of this to your tv? There is no way that your tv has enough inputs for each of those devices?
retrogametech Nice setup. SMS in the centre :) A year ago I had: PS3 80 GB, PS3 super slim, Dreamcast  lightgun (needs CRTscreen), Megadrive 1, Megadrive 2  SMSadapter, NES  turbo joystick, Wii black and a Gaming PC. It was all hooked up to a Samsung 37 HD. I was thinking about getting a scanline generator for retro feeling. I sold almost everything when I moved. I kept the wii for my son. Now Im using apps on the wii until I can afford a PS4. Do you have a goal for your setup?
retrogametech You mentioned that your WIi is softmodded, but not your PS2 (I assume). If you have a fat PS2, you really should install an IDE hard drive and get it softmodded. Its very easy, and shouldnt even take 15 minutes.
retrogametech damn that modem was dusty!ahhaahaaha  just fuckin with you ...that is a clean and sweet set up...great video and setup!
retrogametech I too use my PS3 just for the exclusives. I use my 360 for any other games.
retrogametech i want to know how you keep it so dust free xd
retrogametech bit delayed but good video mateneed some advice if possible i have few older consoles but connected to new modern tv. no space for old tv whats best i can do with connection?
retrogametech The SD player for your .mkv files what is that exactly?I use a Westerndigital video player that I connect my external HDs to, but I always have difficulty finding a good external player for my growing MKV files. please share.
retrogametech Are you selling one of your dream cast plz replay pm me if u got more dream cast plz thanks
retrogametech a pokemon n64 would look wicked in amongst it ) hahahehe.. ive just sneaked my very own retro corner back into the living room to the mrs horror but just got me snes clone plumbed in at the moment.
retrogametech Nice set up! Thanx for the vids
retrogametech I could hear the CRT before you showed it. Drives me crazy!
retrogametech I know that you cant reply but do you think that you can do a tutorial video on how to mod the ps3 please. Ive been looking around and there is none. I also really trust you.
retrogametech My setup is very simple.Its a GBA...
retrogametech Do a controller collection
retrogametech no atari, snes, nes, neogeo. not even a phillips cdi
retrogametech How much was your little multimedia player you have looking into getting one
retrogametech What kind of media player is that ? Im looking for something small like that for our game room here at the house .
retrogametech Friday ill be shooting a 2013 Gaming Snapshot as im all sorted in my new place with my gaming setup up and running!
retrogametech oh cool you mail ordered some game systems from America.. nice start.
retrogametech Great set up! But Im sure theres space to add a wonderful Wii U 32GB. Just the black gamepad in its stand would look awesome in your setup )
retrogametech What a waste of money!.......................... said no gamer ever :D
retrogametech Hello! I was just wondering where you got the tv stand that is in your gaming setup snapshot videos? I am remodeling my house and I wanted to get something like that to display all my game consoles and such. Cheers!
retrogametech You can get a kinect lens adapter that clips on to shorten its range!! http:www.amazon.co.ukNykoZoomRangeReductionLensdpB0050SYS5A
retrogametech U gotta get the xbox one bf4 its like a new gaming experience I use to play pc game like garrys mod not the best graphics but what. Im sayin is it feels like a pc game
retrogametech Well I dont have all my consoles in a single room. The N64 and PS3 are in my brothers room, hooked up to the monitor on his desk, plus where half of the PS1 games are. The PS4 and Wii are in the game room, which is also where most of the games are. A 360 is in my other brothers room, and we use to have one downstairs in the living room. The Xbox, another Xbox 360, and Xbox One are in my room, all hooked up to my tv. The PS1 is in my closet along with half of the games I have for it. Plus I have a Sega Genesis plugnplay in my closet.
retrogametech Cheers, dude. Hope to see a vid soon!
retrogametech weak sauce on milk toast, mate.. but true none the less.. i even have some shelves! i just cant fit them into the room! haha.
retrogametech See previous comment )
retrogametech love the channel... what media player is that ... looks tiny would go great in my man cave
retrogametech Hang on the PS2s Network Adapter doesnt have SATA. It has IDE on it. Pretty sure.
retrogametech I demand more content from you sir!! Wheres our regular pick up vids!? :P
retrogametech It was done several years ago but I think it was Plasticoat or something similar.
retrogametech Id love to but never had enough money for it. One day! :)
retrogametech Cool, I have that setup myself. I bought the Phat PS2, a network adapter, and found an old PATA HDD by Maxtor which fits perfectly. I modded my memory card from my Modded Slim PS2 and load HD Loader from it on my Phat PS2. I rip my games their, 1) Laser lasts, discs arent used (just once to rip), faster. Its very useful
retrogametech The shelves? 10 from my local discount store. :)
retrogametech Ive been holding out on one of those for a little while now. Id like to wait for the hardware and software to develop just a little further before jumping in. They look pretty sweet though! You got any recommendations?
retrogametech They have TONS of them! :P
retrogametech Ive been holding out on one of those for a little while now. Id like to wait for the hardware and software to develop just a little further before jumping in. They look pretty sweet though! You got any recommendations?
retrogametech They have TONS of them! :P
retrogametech Lol Martin if I did that I would have to go to the inlaws house as most of my systems are now in boxes ready for my house move :( I will try and get it all setup when I move in a few weeks time then if I get chance ill do a video.
retrogametech Same here. Id seen a thread over on HUKD and got it from John Lewis with a 5 year guarantee :) . Great TV! I appreciate you watching!
retrogametech Thanks. Glad to someone else feels the same about ME! haha. Im looking forward to playing through Deus Ex :) . No, the 32X I have modded with a 5060Hz switch (probably should have mentioned that in the vid). Its a little complicated to explain but the 32X and Mega Drive need to be set to the same video setting (most of the time). The Mega CD is just stock PAL and plays as you would expect.
retrogametech I have no intention of getting either. I dont know anything about them, I quit paying attention about A day after the Xbox Three was announced. Even if I wanted one, Id wait A year or two. After that RROD shit I dont trust either of them.
retrogametech Im from just outside Glasgow :)
retrogametech You say that with your massive collections. :P
retrogametech Very organized! I wish I had the time and patience to make my setup look like that.
retrogametech that sega genesis (?)  mega drive is a bulky beast! I remember seeing the tv infomercials here in the states trying to promote the elaborate, cumbersome setup and sell it to gamers. You might have the only one in the UK, mate! Great setup although i have to ask, do you ever get grief from old school nintendo fans? No retro setup is complete without an old SNES according to most US gamers. Alas, i only kept my gamecube.
retrogametech Only 100? I swear, I could strangle you right now. That was a steal, man!
retrogametech The dev stuff can really reach crazy prices sometimes. I passed up on a faulty Katana for about 100 a few years back and have regretted it ever since!
retrogametech Didnt you pick up an N64 not too long ago? Or did I just imagining this? Well it seems Deus Ex is a must play :) . Lots of people praising it so I think Ill get started on that later. I didnt know youd played the first ME. If you thought the first one was even half decent then youll really enjoy the second. Personally I think it might be one of the greatest video games ever made (no joke).
retrogametech Why doesnt the 3D adapter work on LCD? I understand the light gun games need a CRT, do the glasses also pick up messages from the screen? Also what was that cart in the Saturn? Is the Xbox one connected by component cables? Do you have any old Nintendo consoles, or do you use the Wiis virtual console for all that? Sorry for all the questions, lol.
retrogametech Amazing set up, it looks incredibly well laid out and organised. The matching black scheme across the whole thing really ties it together, great work man!
retrogametech Wheres your Hellghast figure? It was pretty neat!
retrogametech I love the format. Im still sad it lost out to Bluray because I think it was the better format. I picked up most of my discs when places like HMV were trying to rid themselves of excess stock after HDDVD lost the support of manufacturers and publishers. Most were only 12 newsealed! XD. Same as you I picked up a few 360 players from CEX and Game for between 510. Unless you run the audio through an amp its going to be pretty quiet. Are you using it with a PC monitor or something?
retrogametech One is a promo preorder bonus. Its not a game. :)
retrogametech quick question mate.. how much did your unit cost you in total? its ikea yes?
retrogametech 7 consoles stacked? Haha, awesome. Thanks for watching :)
retrogametech Damn that sucks, I only got mine because of a lucky windfall.
retrogametech Well, it had a great life. It still works, but we have flat screens now. Its been in loads of spots, the front room, the bedroom, the office, the bedroom again, then the office again. Its getting on the fragile side. It was a fantastic telly, but we dont use it. :(
retrogametech it looks like you have 2 resident evil Revelations for the 3ds i am jw cause it looked like it in the video
retrogametech So we can expect a sex toys collection and pickup vid in the near future then? P.s. That is some weak sauce excuse for not collecting!...... need more shelves, pfffftttt... :P
retrogametech Yes, it makes absolutely no sense in why they got rid of them.
retrogametech Sumvision Cyclone Micro. I cant fault it :)
retrogametech I only have a 3 HDDVDs for my 360 addon drive, but all 3 are better than their bluray counterparts. I have The Thing, The Big Lebowski  Apollo 13 which all have varying levels DNR on the blurays but the HDDVDs have a nice natural look to them. Its a recent acquisition, got the drive and the discs from CeX online, I may pick up some more HDDVDs but dont want too many in case the drive fails plus its a bit noisy. Any way to boost audio levels from 360 audio adapter output to headphones?
retrogametech Haha, good to know. Thanks :)
retrogametech It was about 25 from Argos about 3 years ago I think )
retrogametech Awesome video as usual, never get bored of watching your great setup man!
retrogametech One of them is just a preorder bonus lenticular box  poster.
retrogametech Works perfectly for me, yes. I love mine and use them for everything other than listening to music. But shop around and dont pay too much for a set.
retrogametech Yeah, its an epic trilogy! :)
retrogametech I take it you like the black look! ) Very swish looking collection mate.
retrogametech I have the same TV, bought it 3 years ago for 299. Probably the best purchase Ive ever made  I think itll last me until 4K is affordable. PS Love your videos, Im an engineer so the inner workings of things fascinate me.
retrogametech Gotta love the Master System out front. ()
retrogametech Haha, repurposing. :P
retrogametech Nope, thats actually a Retro Lancer. Hammerbursts dont have bayonets.
retrogametech I wish I had something obscure. I think the most obscure thing I have is MK1 Sega Saturn control pad. Whats so obscure about it? NOTHING, that is how unobscure my collection is.
retrogametech DC beermats, how random! 3 very interesting pieces here RGT. :)
retrogametech Nope. Wrong side of the country.
retrogametech I dont even know what that is, haha
retrogametech That is camo in.gears pink dont paint it might be worth more one.Fay yo.gears fan well.cool Mabel I should do a video like thus some.time
retrogametech yeah, i know 50 isnt too bad but i find it difficult to spend that much money on only one used item. just my own hang up there
retrogametech Oh OK...I thought the Lancers always had a chainsaw, learn something every day er? :)
retrogametech You should make a response too! :) Im sure you have some weird and interesting stuff in your collection, haha
retrogametech when it comes to most console innovations they have always been there first funnily enough.
retrogametech NGage Sega Rally will be on that list!
retrogametech Bright pink, just as I remember it ingame ) :D
retrogametech Yeah I think Im going to keep it as it is. Its more interesting as a bright pink machine gun, haha. You should totally make a response to Eds vid!
retrogametech Isnt that a Hammerburst not a Lancer?
retrogametech No he didnt Kind of a chill guy to talk to. He did do the Dom voice from time to time which was cool , but you could tell he had to change his face to do the voice. I dont know if that makes any sense but yeah lol
retrogametech The dream eye would be a cool video AYE
retrogametech Most obscure in my collection? Hmmm...does Monster Rancher count?
retrogametech alright martin, i just posted my videoresponse yesterday )
retrogametech You can sometime find them kinda cheap on Ebay. You just have to keep watching and youll get lucky eventually. 50 actually isnt too bad considering how long collectible Dreamcast stuff has become in recent years. All in I paid about 20 for mine a several years back and that was a really good deal then.
retrogametech i really wanted the dream eye and i found it for about 25 on ebay but last minute it was taken buy some ahole that bid 50 on it!!
retrogametech You should make a vid and post it on Eds vid! :)
retrogametech A future vid perhaps :)
retrogametech I might have to start responding to these top 3 tuesdays. My most obscure items would have to be my sealed copy of Pilot for the Timex Sinclair 1000, the only one I know of. I had Sega Saturn Devkit (Cartdev. Rev. B) I found at a local game store. I modded a saturn to interface with it, but I sold it a couple months ago for nearly twice what I paid. My only other somewhat obscure item is my prerelease rental dreamcast console (I used to have two).
retrogametech The only software I have for it is the disc it came bundled with. Its all in Japanese so I have no clue how to use it effectively. I know you can do video chat, photo editing, and email. Not sure about games. I sacrificed 1 of the mats when I first got them. Cant bring myself to use the rest :P Tbh these prob arent my most obscure items. I thought I should try and show some stuff I hadnt previously (or at least recently) done vids on :) . Thanks for bringing TTT back from the grave! XD
retrogametech Haha, yep 100 authentic! :)
retrogametech Thanks. Its been fun watching these TTT responses.
retrogametech Its a cool little device. Ill try and make a vid about it soon :)
retrogametech Very true. The little webcam even doubles as a standalone portable digital camera. Back in 2000 that would have been pretty mind blowing!
retrogametech I remember when the Retro Lancer was selling cheap on Play.com, kicking myself that I didnt buy one now.
retrogametech Dream Eye!!! Hmmm Heres me thinking the Playstation Eye was a clever name, turns out Sega was there first....
retrogametech Sounds like an edinburgh accent?????
retrogametech dude would u ever do a giveaway like idk the retro lancer haha :)
retrogametech Nice items. I love the pink gun and video chat camera.
retrogametech those dreamcast coasters are awesome xD probably better than what i been doing and putting my tea on a corrupted cd i made into a coaster xD hey its a broken cd what else am i gonna use it for?
retrogametech lol now these are some really obscure items martin xD
retrogametech lol at the third item, you should wall mount it... :D
retrogametech The top 3 most rare gamesgame systems in your collection
retrogametech Haha, if I had the space I think it would get wall mounted along with the Portal gun :) .
retrogametech The older I get the more I realize that the Dreamcast was way ahead of the curve on certain things. And my wife has the pink lancer as well , when we went to comic con Carlos Ferro ( the voice of Dom in gears of war series) signed the blade.
retrogametech The Dream eye was actually made to do both. Sadly only two games supported it with other planned ones, but it came out at the end of the dreamcast life cycle.
retrogametech Wow, I was just watching some old Retro Game Tech videos! Always glad to see RGT in my sub box :)
retrogametech I just bought one of these off eBay, probably from the same seller.Do you have instructions for building a supergun like the one youre using in the video ?
retrogametech do you think youll ever make a cabinet for it to make it into a arcade game?
retrogametech I spent a few minutes on eBay and found the seller. Then I decided I didnt really want such a huge box just to play not really virtua fighter. Now if I could find a complete Naomi for 25 quid... )
retrogametech Something youve ever considered picking up? Its would work perfectly with your supergun setup.
retrogametech Haha, yeah thats a bit random. Not sure what thats all about.
retrogametech dont know whats wrong but i couldnt Finnish watching this because of a very high pitched whistle noise
retrogametech Damn I really want one of these! They dont ship to US tho! That samurai shodown game looks awesome.
retrogametech Same here. I watched the Wild Ambition review before deciding whether or not to buy :P
retrogametech Im really surprised that they dont sell for more! For less than the price of a new 360PS3 game you can get a fully boxed new Neo Geo system and 1 game. Crazy!
retrogametech I just had a thought... Do you know a lot about PC hardware?
retrogametech I still pray for a release on HBMAME, the missing NeoGeo Prototypes. That could be awsome.
retrogametech Yeah its a real shame more games werent made for it. I think it could have been great. Im more of a hardware collector so the lack of games doesnt bother me too much. But Beast Busters 2nd looks like the game to have! Sadly it uses its own specific board and is very rare, desirable  expensive.
retrogametech I dont own any cabs. Lack of space is the biggest factor :P
retrogametech Im all about adding more boxes to the corner :) . 30 was just too tempting a deal for me to resist. Granted, a year from now Ill be digging through my cupboard and the phrase wtf is this? will be uttered.
retrogametech Do you collect old PC games?
retrogametech 8:20 Same voice actor as Link?
retrogametech Love seeing these old rare hardware!
retrogametech Haha, well theres still another 7 of these available from the same seller if youre interested :P Thanks for watching  commenting!
retrogametech Are you getting a cabinet at some point?
retrogametech ah danm i was going to buy two i hate you now but i love you for getting one
retrogametech Anyone else hearing how Joe sounds a LOT like Link during that demo fight?
retrogametech Awesome video, really interesting to learn about this as i had never heard of it before
retrogametech Sadly you can only get 4 games for that hardware, probably why they are cheap, but if you like the 4 games or just 1 of them excellent, I decided against getting one as I prefer the MVS anyway and there is plenty more for that as you probably already know anyway.
retrogametech I have almost no idea what you talk about, but watching the before and afters of your ebay junk series is so interesting. Your voice is just so calming.
retrogametech would it be possiable to get the sellars ebay name? i cant find the relevant listings lol
retrogametech I had a HNG64 and Sam Sho 64, I gave it to a friend for free because its huge, heavy and a piece of crap (and I love SNK). Roads Edge is a cool game though, but you need a driving cabinet for it. I played it at the King Dome before it was demolished.
retrogametech Yes, I have to admit I wouldnt mind getting one myself  the fighting board seems the best bet as it seems to support 4 games. I dont know what SNK were thinking of? After the success of the MVSAES and the great idea of one board that takes all the carts they end up producing 3 different boards... Its also a shame that they felt they had to compete with the 3D market that had started as many people loved the 2D SNK games and not the new 3D generation.
retrogametech Didnt he mention a viewer from the UK sent him the board and a game? Probably from the same excess stock.
retrogametech You might enjoy android mini pc, would be cool to see you do a review on one since you can run emulation easily with android and load up all your roms onto a sd card.
retrogametech Saw the hyper 64 on cgr.
retrogametech What games do you have gor it? I know their wernt many
retrogametech Mr GameTech I have a game gear that is broken and I want it to work I attempted to fix it but Im a big NOOB and I was wondering if I could send it to you for you to fix and send back and record it
retrogametech They just didnt release enough games for the platform before SNK stopped making it. Plus it wasnt a universal form factor . You needed to buy different modes of motherboard for different games.
retrogametech Id love one but lack of space and money mean its not possible for now. In future maybe.
retrogametech I was offered a deal with a number of games for a very cheap price..... I decided to pass as it would just end up another box in the corner. :D
retrogametech Haha, if only I had the space for some cabs! :)
retrogametech Thats awesome dude. Nice one, classic games room have a review of samurai showdown.
retrogametech strange, i had a CRT tv up until 2 years ago and i could never hear that.
retrogametech wow thats a real bargain martin ) i just saw one guy on ebay.de who wanted 1500 for a hyper neogeo 64 board with 3 games i think, wich is way too much i like te hardware aswell but it is so huge and there are not alot of games available for it so i just stick to my oneslot i think :D
retrogametech These have been selling for peanuts for years! I remember picking a NOS board with 2 NOS games (In boxes) for around 30 around 5 years ago! Must me 1000s left! :D I no longer have a kit but I think the games dont look to bad and for the price definitely worth investigating in the kit! Even if it is massive!
retrogametech Dude, where were you last year? There was a guy on eBay selling a ton of these brand new with two games (other one being Samurai Showdown) for a tenner! I also got a copy of Bikuri One for 3 loose.
retrogametech If youre interested in playing these old arcade boards then the best thing to do is Google how to build a supergun. Or if you dont fancy building your own you can buy premade devices on ebay.
retrogametech Sorry to bother you Im italian and I have an old nes pal with two control pads and a zapper. Unfortunately only one pad functions. The other connects to the console but if I press start the game doesnt do anything. It comes with some games that i dont use anymore too. Im going to sell it for a reasonable price and I wondered if you were intrested in it. thanks in advance
retrogametech tempting but i barely have room for what i have xD recently got a dreamcast and its budged next to my nes and xbox 360 xD gotta n64 sat on a cardbored box and a ps2 and a ps3 super slim on a shelf thingy above the nes dc and xbox would like to get one but i have no room  oh and my mega drive is sat on my nes... now where the heck do i put my snes... CURSE YOU LIMITED SPACE!!!
retrogametech Pretty cool! How on earth do you keep finding amazing bargains!
retrogametech Man, I love your videos. Theyre always really insightful with plenty of cool content. You also just seem like a genuinely awesome and chilled guy, thanks for taking the time to make these. :)
retrogametech Only 7 games for a full set:)
retrogametech check my rare console that i found on dumpster. nice vid btw
retrogametech seen these on ebay was going to get one but didnt for some reason, cool system but not many games available for them, cool none the less
retrogametech And an expensive set at that! :P
retrogametech I dont know much about what consoles you have, but do you have a full Neo Geo arcade cabinet? And if not, would you like to have one, or does it take too much space in?
retrogametech Its easyleisuresales. 6 left in stock on .co.uk. Ships to Europe only.
retrogametech Generally its not the hardware that differs from one region to another but the BIOS. The games might also have some regional differences but that is usually set by the BIOS. And normally you can pick and choose your settings from the BIOS menus. But Im speaking generally here. Im only familiar with SNK hardware.
retrogametech Not really. I have a couple sitting on the shelf but I dont think you could call it a collection.
retrogametech Yes, its the CRT. If youre younger, then it will likely sound louder. (Peoples hearing diminishes as they get older, and it gets harder to high the highpitched noise.) Its a noise you got used to years ago with CRT TVs and monitors. Proper retro sound. :p Doesnt bother me, but then I am getting quite old now. lol
retrogametech This is the same item Ive been looking at for week or so. I soon as I saw this vid, I rushed over to eBay and bought one, loll. Only one left now guys!
retrogametech Oh no. the arcade bug has bitten you too :D
retrogametech I cant hear anything...
retrogametech Nice vid and pickup. It is a real shame they didnt produce more games for them  thats what puts me off buying one, and I think is why the price can be low on these. If you like the few games you can play on each one its worth it I guess, personally I think the best game is Beast Busters 2nd but not sure what main board that works on.
retrogametech Its the Neo Geo I like, always have, even though I cant really afford it still. The NG64 never held any interest for me let alone I never see any games for it on eBay so why should I bother? Reminds me too much of the N64 too which I would like to avoid lol. I have the one I want, just wish it wasnt so exposed and fragile, but that is my fault for not waiting, oh well.
retrogametech I like how the auction posting turned into a big political rant at the end.
retrogametech In MAME still dont have sound, but i finish this game and i defeat the boss. That multigames someway must be dumped.
retrogametech Sorry mate, I was right that they would sell quickly when this vid came up :0). From looking at other comments it seems that this seller sells batches of these from time to time so you should be able to pick up another one at some point.
retrogametech Haha, thanks dude. Been busy with work. I wish I had a bit more energy for making vids!
retrogametech Just wondered if you could help as I to purchased a Hyper 64 fighting board with Fatal Fury and I assumed I could just plug the jamma connector from my consolised mvs in to the Hyper, But when I did it boots up fine and displays a picture but I have no sound and my controller doesnt work...is there anything I need to do as I seen from your video that you was using a consolised mvs to power up yours. I have even changed the switch underneath from jamma to mvs but still no luck. Great vid!
retrogametech Cool. Have you bought many games for it? Wild Ambition is very cheap but the others seem a bit expensive. Ive had my eye on these for a while. Thought Id better get one now while theyre still affordable and available :).
retrogametech Yeah definitely. Shoot me a PM dude.
retrogametech What kind of JAMMA thingy do I need? Im new to this :(
retrogametech Boom! Just bought one :)
retrogametech The high pitched noise is the CRT and is only audible to people under a certain age. I cant hear a thing :P
retrogametech Haha, theyre practically bullet proof! Total overkill on the shielding. But those carts with the embossed SNK logo do look awesome! :) Btw great to see T3T back again! Didnt have time to make a response but 2 of your choices were identical to mine anyway! haha. And not that it matters now but Heavenly Sword on PS3 would be my third choice.
retrogametech Just curious, does arcade hardware like the Hyper Neo Geo usually have regional differences?
retrogametech And used by terrorist to set off bombs! xD
retrogametech Ive got the king of the fighters on ps1 and some of the characters look like the ones in king of the fighters
retrogametech Just keep trawling ebay and eventually youll find something interesting :P
retrogametech Haha, just as well you did! Within about 6hrs of me posting this vid I noticed all his remaining stock was sold.
retrogametech 1500!?!?! Wow, bargain! haha. I know what you mean. The games arent all that great although its still a very cool piece of Neo Geo history. But it doesnt even come close to the awesome MVS! :)
retrogametech It is an interesting piece of arcade harware to have. Maybe it wasnt successful because they spent more money on the metal housings than they did developing the games )
retrogametech Been watching videos for a long time! Always good some older tech from my childhood. Please subscribe to my channel when you can:)
retrogametech My left bumper is a bit sticky but thats what makes it so fun
retrogametech Have this and Love this controller on my PC for Dark Souls !!
retrogametech Special tool XD, its just torx...
retrogametech I wonder how lucky it is to have a father like youHey can I get an xboxSure pays 50 and repairs it
retrogametech Whats the name of the tool to open the 360 controler?
retrogametech Thanks, I appreciate the nice comment!
retrogametech My friend have a problem lately: when I have played Megadrive, when I push to one side of the control  B  C pause the game. Play Hang On sucks because I can not make turns driving the booster and so on. Some information:  Ive already tested various controls and the problem persists, then control is not defective  In the 2nd control is the same problem as I put Sonic 2 to test the command and when the game was paused too.
retrogametech Thats the kind of wash I give to all old controllers. Consoles not always, but controllers are always very filthy. Excellent repair video as always!
retrogametech Always an interesting time watching your videos and seeing how you fault test.
retrogametech If the seller watched this video, they must be really feelin like a numpty.
retrogametech Haha, I think Id have to be really drunk to make that mistake :P
retrogametech Wait  do all dpads on Xbox 360 controllers spin like that? 2:11
retrogametech are you going to get a 2ds?
retrogametech I cant quite place your accent, but I love it.
retrogametech What bit did you need? Id like to open one I got for free.
retrogametech and has to make the switch this chip? Because I think this is the problem.
retrogametech Yeah the GTA5 HDD install texture issues were acknowledged by Rockstar themselves. On 360  PS3 you have to install about 8GB of data, and then on both systems they read from the disc  the HDD simultaneously. Its essentially to make the most of the now ageing hardware, to increase draw distance and for most part remove loading screens. But if you install 360 play disc it causes issues as its trying to read from HDD twice. Im about 12 way through the main missions and about 22hrs logged so far
retrogametech haha, was thinking GamerRage from the start, they seem nice controllers, i love my Ghost Recon Future Soldier controller, doesnt have the new Style DPAD though, nice one
retrogametech I cant remember the exact size but its a Torx security bit. Just search ebay for xbox 360 controller tool or similar.
retrogametech Hello any chance you can fix my 3ds please my slot wont work and I saw your video but I dont have those tools may you please fix it for me
retrogametech Watching this stuff really wants me to get some faulty stuff and repair it. Though I will have no idea what Im doing. Which is one of the reasons why I dont do it. XD Oh well. Thanks for the upload! Please upload abit more! D
retrogametech Ive been using shampoo! :P
retrogametech you go girl! wait, wrong salutation...
retrogametech Looked really nice and clean in the end. I have the light blue Halo 4 controllers that came with the Halo 4 custom shell console. Really nice, but it can be a little distracting when the batteries start to run out and the LEDs start flashing, due to the clear material. But Im nitpicking really, they are really nice. Have you been playing GTA 5? Ive been loving it so far, just a shame you cant install the 2nd disc without texture issues (ifwhen I get a spare 16GB USB Ill install to that).
retrogametech no, just this limited edition one.
retrogametech You have to be careful with the rubber parts. I myself use cotton swabs to dig out all the grub because i made that mistake with an NES Controller.
retrogametech Search Tac Switch on google, you will find buttons very close to what he has
retrogametech And of course, dont use anything too harsh as a detergent.
retrogametech Awesome! I do the same thing  bathroom sink (or bath) to clean consoles and controllers etc. The one thing I dont do is put the rubber parts in with the carbon pads  safer to just wipe them lightly. That said, some people put the circuit boards in the dishwasher  I kid you not.
retrogametech Didnt you used to have the old white 360? Also do you play online now? One last thing why dont you do videos repairing sony handhelds?
retrogametech Very nice pickup, a very nice looking controller at a very nice price
retrogametech That little bastard still catches me out every now and then! :P
retrogametech can you fix my gba sp screen please
retrogametech I saw your face in the DPad!
retrogametech DO U HAVE A VIDEO ON HOW TO WORK ON PS3 CONTROLLERS?
retrogametech I need to get all my damned internet issues sorted I miss watching this channel. Especially the videos of this nature.
retrogametech One dislike... The seller must have seen this video.
retrogametech Its not so much talent, just basic soldering skills :P
retrogametech Great video, may I ask what screw driver you used? Thanks
retrogametech can you make a video on how to repair a broken analog stick on a 360 controller? it would be intersting to see your take on the subject.
retrogametech Great work Martin..:)
retrogametech I wish you could fix my control. Id pay to have it fix.
retrogametech Dude youre videos are a treat i always get so excited when i see one in my sub box. My nipples get erect from the sound of your voice.
retrogametech Nintendo might do something. You should contact them first, for troubleshooting and warranty.
retrogametech i love mechanical keyboards because i can clean them in much the same way you clean off the controller in this vid: pop off the keys, dump em in the sink great video as always
retrogametech at least it wasnt expensive,works good
retrogametech My face has featured in several previous vids :P
retrogametech I think the best thing to do is just buy a new controller every year or two. It doesnt matter how careful you are with them because they always wear out.
retrogametech He probably tried to mod the controller and failed so he sold it xD
retrogametech Thank you so much for the cool video, as always. Id need the connect button microswitch, I broke it some time ago and now I cant connect my controller on the pc and its annoying. Do you know where can I get one online? If you do have a spare one I can pay you the switch and the shipping to Italy! Thanks.
retrogametech Excellent repair. YouTube has buggered the comments so I cant read what other people have written. I can see there are 33 comments here when I write mine. A nice feature :P
retrogametech I did and still do :) . No I dont play online anymore. I dont do videos repairing Sony Handhelds because theres not much resale value in the PSPVita. And my own PSPGo works just fine :)
retrogametech Yeah another Lets Repair! I find these vids very relaxing to watch. Thank you! How is your MVS Project progressing?
retrogametech Sorry, none spare at the moment.
retrogametech It was not my CM, a friends let fall a bottle on the computer and i told him that i was able to repair it.
retrogametech id you have any spare time can you tell me what soldering iron you used in this video i would like to get started repairing xbox controllers as a job with my freind thank you for reading :)
retrogametech Awsome...how about a lool in your parts bin? Sounds like a magical place. Enjoyed :)
retrogametech You should probably buy those tools instead, itll be cheaper than shipping it to him and paying him to fix it, since hes unlikely to do it for free.
retrogametech I just cleaned my controller the other day the hidden screw behind the security sticker caught me out XD
retrogametech Haha, maybe Ill take the camera with me next time I go out to the shed.
retrogametech Yes, some methods seem unorthodox but if care is taken then usually theres little risk of damage.
retrogametech Ebay and hardware stores should have everything you need for these types of job.
retrogametech I have like Xbox controllers that are broken. How do I fix them???
retrogametech The xbox 360 controller is very well designed but internally is a mess. The bumpers are weakly designed. The triggers may scratch the case in some cases, the analog sticks on the silver controllers scratch the internal paint and they arent smooth anymore due the friction with the border, the headphone jack may stop letting you use the headset due some internal misconnection and my battery pack isnt properly charged by any of my controllers, I use an external charger to refresh my batteries.
retrogametech Fuck off you stereo typical bastard.
retrogametech Dishwasher is overkill and a bit dangerous for certain components but i washed an entire CM full of oil (not kitchen oil, but motor) with a toothbrush and soap. If you protect the processor socket its ok.
retrogametech i have a xbox duke that right analog stick is messed up. i cant see how to fix it. it is loose and dont really work.
retrogametech Thanks for watching and commenting :)
retrogametech You used motor oil on what?
retrogametech I love this controller, I use it on my PC with Steam big picture for action games etc :)
retrogametech what wat soldering iron is that and what solder do you use or microsoft uses thank your for your time?
retrogametech what camera do you use?
retrogametech hmm, maybe buy clones so i can have a reason to amass tons of older games then slowly replace fakes with real systems... with real maintenance :L
retrogametech Clone Console  Mega Drive X  Russian Import  Fake SEGA Genesis Mk3  Mini Review
retrogametech How is the sound? More videos?
retrogametech Marting, coc de lah? Lol. Thats how r u in Russian. :P
retrogametech Sega genesis was more popular in Russia, because it was cheaper than SNES.
retrogametech With all the recent horrible YouTube updates, I can reassuringly say that it isnt a bug anymore, Larry. Theyve gone and screwed everything up again, like usual.
retrogametech I had an Famicom replica :D i got it 96 :3 i lived at the time in Ukrain
retrogametech Sweet russian sega system clone. That does not look to bad.iv seen some crapy sega clones before. Were did u get that wireless sega contorler at?
retrogametech Please do more videos you do like 1 a month
retrogametech The wireless pads were from eBay a few months back. Got them cheapfaulty and repaired them. They seem to work with everything :)
retrogametech .   ,     ,      .           ,   ,        .
retrogametech Id just use the original Genesis. Theyre very common, built to last and easy to fix if they ever go wrong. :)
retrogametech It plays everything :)
retrogametech Funny, there are Nintendo clones all over the place here, but I never see Sega clones. When I would browse mercado livre in Brazil there are many for sale there, and they are all called Mega Drive. Very interesting hardware for sale there. Great review, love seeing the insides of odd electronics.
retrogametech That sucks but its also really interesting to me. I love seeing all the weird clone variations people came up with.
retrogametech China is the king of knockoffs.
retrogametech Would love to see someone attempt to clone a 32x, or even make a Neptune.
retrogametech Ive got one of those. Its really cool cause of the region switch.
retrogametech Not that youd want to, but thatd be easily made into a portable
retrogametech Yeah, Ive been subbed for years!
retrogametech Yes, its Russian. I had one Mega Drive clone that looked like Fat PS1, but it worked like charm.
retrogametech With such a small PCB that would make an excellent case modding candidate for making unusual objects into gaming consoles :)
retrogametech This is that we really had in Russia. We also had a terrible clone of NES or Famicom called Dendy. Games were great  most of them were Japanese, copyrights were cut out, some games were copied unproperly, which made them impossible to complete.
retrogametech Yup, its Russian import
retrogametech Thank You :) greets from Poland :)
retrogametech Timbeeeeeeerrr!!!!!!!! :D
retrogametech does the clone actually work with a 32X
retrogametech Me thinks it might need a weight in there XD
retrogametech Love the Pokemon on the back.
retrogametech You are welcome, mate! Glad you liked it! Btw, I can see Dendy Classic 2 at my local internet auction for a humble price of 200 USD. xD Good luck with that mission.
retrogametech Its the first Stage music of the first Streets of Rage.
retrogametech I would rather say Kahkh Dehlah, because it sound more like real Russian would say it.
retrogametech Lets put pokemon on it.. because... video games!
retrogametech I didnt know that, thanks. :)
retrogametech Interesting! I didnt know they made Genesis clones!
retrogametech i like the look of those things.. v cool. shame its not a true chip set clone.. that would be sweet.. with built in multi region etc
retrogametech Ive been keeping an eye open for one of those things. Theyre very rare nowadays and pretty expensive when they show up on ebay. Cool thing to have though!
retrogametech A smartphone with a emulator would do a way better job at playing games than this thing would.
retrogametech Yay another Scottish techie YouTuber
retrogametech they should make neo geo clones for once
retrogametech Yay another Scottish techie YouTuber
retrogametech Sega CD addon definitely doesnt work with it :(
retrogametech Thank you! Glad you like them. Hello from Scotland :)
retrogametech In Russia mega drive x plays you!
retrogametech By the way thanks for your video. very interesting
retrogametech Always interesting to see clones.
retrogametech It had to be done! :P
retrogametech Mega Drives from Thailand? Sounds interesting...
retrogametech My only main issue with it is that the cartridge slot doors are bright red. Other than that, it looks pretty nice. Been considering getting a Model 3 because of the sleekness of it and the built in region mods are an excellent touch
retrogametech System on chip? Booo! Hisss!
retrogametech Have you ever seen a decent NES clone with similar 60hz, region switches. I love my NES  original pal games but they play super slow? Makes me sad.
retrogametech I know its weird. There must be a big market for them somewhere in the world. Id like to visit one of the stores that still sells all those crazy bootleg carts with bizarre ROM hacks.
retrogametech Are you subscribed because on my account the video popped up in What to watch and My Subscriptions.
retrogametech I actually like the Color Scheme
retrogametech please watch my rare console i found on dumpster. btw good video review
retrogametech Thanks! Ive been wanting to make vids but just havent had the time. Appreciate the support :)
retrogametech I have that Atgames Sega Genesis 80 games in one consoles. Its okay but the sound is off.
retrogametech Ill assume the 32X wasnt compatible lol!
retrogametech I dont know why that is. It might be because Sega never officially released or distributed the console in your region? Piracy and bootlegs seem to be most common in countries where the official product is hard to find or overpriced.
retrogametech Can it run Sega CD, or 32x?
retrogametech I dont know what they did but the whole site is messed up for me these days. My feed misses out loads of vids. And anything that does show up and I dont watch within 24hrs simply disappears! Plus, lots of vids are now plastered with those really freakn annoying little annotation box adverts. Google are totally killing the community aspect of the YouTube. Anyone with a smaller channel looking to increase their viewer baseshare content is basically screwed.
retrogametech I might take some photos and add them to the description for anyone whod like to read or translate the box and manual. Thanks for watching!
retrogametech Were the ribbon cables simply hot glued in place?? :
retrogametech Great video!,) In 1993 most Lithuanian gamers was never seen a original console. Now I collecting all these stuff.
retrogametech Haha, really? Ill need to check and see.
retrogametech Hah, I have this fake console in 2000 year! ) Russian fakes
retrogametech Thanks for that link! I just watched it. Really interesting and very funny documentary. Now Im on a mission to find myself an original Dendy for the collection! :) Thanks for watching!
retrogametech poor imbalanced console :D
retrogametech I did wonder about this clone, glad you investigated before I did!!
retrogametech LOL, the 32xSega Channel stack at the end.
retrogametech Yeah, the AtGames consoles are notoriously bad for getting the sound wrong.
retrogametech Its getting to be quite the annoying glitch now. Ive missed out on loads of peoples videos I subbed to recently .
retrogametech Thanks, dude. Good to see youre still active here on YouTube :)
retrogametech You could probably make a homemade Nomad out of an old GameGear and a cheap LCD screen :)
retrogametech what is the name of the song at the end ??
retrogametech Loved the ending , I wonder what else can fit on that clone machine .
retrogametech Thats dicing with death :P
retrogametech Yes, I have collection of clones. The video about NES clones is in montage now. A short teaser about it is in my channel)
retrogametech I was hoping this Mega Drive X would have Mega Man X. l
retrogametech I really enjoy your videos. Also your skills with doing everything one handed is pretty impressive.
retrogametech Do you make gaming videos im a big fan of your channel
retrogametech What is your eBay account?
retrogametech i have the same sky box
retrogametech Use HDTune to check your free hdd for errors and bad sectors , its free and it will tell you the health status of the hdd
retrogametech Are you going to picking up the 2ds?
retrogametech Where do you keep your games?
retrogametech I found a 2tb one in a tv recorder plus it is now used for my desktop that i built
retrogametech I didnt realize you could rip the HDD out of a sky box... Keep the videos coming!
retrogametech Was you grounded when playing with the sata hard drive ? I allways make sure I have my anti static wrist strap on
retrogametech haha, Thanks. Personally I cant stand it.
retrogametech why do you have 2 copy of  Resident Evil Revelations  are they different ?
retrogametech How about a games room tour Martin?
retrogametech Love a good waffle, great vid as always!
retrogametech whats wrong with you? no nostalgia for mario? how young are you?
retrogametech Those Sky boxes suffer from bad caps. If it powers up at all its likely just the caps faulty. HDD can be replaced with another SATA drive. Or you can just strip it down for spares as you suggest )
retrogametech how many DS games do you have? there are over 1700 north american releases!
retrogametech Your new subs must come from that Larry Bundy Jr chap :)
retrogametech well boys get your spears and pitchforks ready for his smb3
retrogametech using a computer with an atom processor... how do you survive?
retrogametech Ahh, that makes sense. I never even thought about the schools being out for summer. Btw, been really enjoying the NerdMasters vids. Keep those coming! :)
retrogametech Awesome teardown video.
retrogametech Awesome find on the Sat box,wish i found stuff like this : Did the box work..why did they throw it?
retrogametech Those are great for pulling hard drives for back up drives.
retrogametech I dont have a games room. But I do have some videos of my gaming setup on my channels main page :)
retrogametech Thanks for the update. I love your channel.
retrogametech Ive been on YouTube a few years and it always seems to happen around this time of year. Strange.
retrogametech It really depends on how many collectors are looking for them when you sell. Typically Id expect them to sell for about 10 each. 3 is a bargain.
retrogametech maybe you can use the Sky case to consolize that MVS project
retrogametech Well done grabbing the Sky box, the 500GB HDD alone was worth your effort. Im surprised Sky didnt take that with them if they were upgrading the neighbours sky box. Yeah I was a Sonic kid, Master System II was my first console, I never had much interest in Mario titles until Super Mario 64. Even then that was years after the N64 release, I picked system up used with Ocarina of Time, Goldeneye, Mario 64 I think for only 25 in a CashConverters (in 2000 or 2001) :)
retrogametech Well, the neighbour is really just a landlord and I think the last tenant did a runner without paying the rentbills. He was just gutting the property for the next guy I think. Sky would probably have like the box back :P 25 seems like a pretty sweet deal considering the games you got! GoldenEye splitscreen multiplayer was still being heavily played by me and my friends well into the 2000s.
retrogametech Nope, theyve 100 genuine. Ive been collecting GBA games for a few years now and can spot the bootlegs from a mile off :P. I only buy boots if theyre of weird ROM hacks or have interesting art. Anytime I make a vid featuring a fake cartsclones I make a point of talking about it.
retrogametech Is there any cheap route to backup Gameboy and Gameboy Advance game saves from an original cartridge and replace a battery for the cart and put the cart back in.
retrogametech I enjoy the odd random video. I find it much easier to make videos while my kids are in school and going to bed earlier.
retrogametech Can you do a video review on your multimedia box usb
retrogametech If your going for all the WayForward games on DS you still need Adventure Time.
retrogametech Thanks, glad it didnt put ya to sleep! haha
retrogametech I dont mind the art style, theyre just boring as all fuck. I dont want to repeat the same stage 1,000 times because I keep dying either. Platformers in general have never been my thing.
retrogametech Your videos are great :)
retrogametech As long as its not on private property then there is nothing illegal about it.
retrogametech Duck Amuck is such a great idea for a game and its done really well. Shame you can see pretty much everything it has to offer in an hour or so.
retrogametech Cool stuff! Ive been busy with Professor Layton games on DS lately. Amazing how much useful stuff you can extract from these junk electronic devices.
retrogametech Quality over quantity :)
retrogametech I wish nintendo would add a second analog stick and upgrade the resolution on both screens. Also they should increase the battery to 2000 mAh :D
retrogametech I hardly see these deals on ebay us, i guess ebay uk and ebay us dont intermingle at all in search results.
retrogametech are you going to be making a GBA games collection video sometime soon?
retrogametech Its not VGA. Its rs232 c
retrogametech Have to ask, what make soldering iron do you use?
retrogametech I think those GBA games are fake.
retrogametech Free Hard drive, sweet :D
retrogametech I cant remember. I think I got it on Amazon a while back. Probably about 1520.
retrogametech Yeah i agree, Whenever im off from school so now in the summer, non of my 300 people that i am subbed too hardly upload
retrogametech Yes but Im not sure how the best way to do it would be. Ideally Id like to show a little gameplay of each game as I show them but that seems like a lot of work. Suggestions are welcome :)
retrogametech I think theyre maybe a bit overrated because of nostalgia. The controls and gameplay are tight but I personally cant stand the art style. It really irritates me for some reason.
retrogametech Yeah that really does sound a bit weird! lol
retrogametech Can you use the hardrive in a ps3 or as a backup to a ps3 as I have three of these boxes. Didnt know I could do this. Where can I get one of them shark thingy me bobs
retrogametech the PAL games look alot different, may look fake, but they arent
retrogametech Lots of parts to harvest :)
retrogametech I have the same Kasumi figure!
retrogametech he mostly has some of the good ones, but mostly the Wayforward made games
retrogametech Ive been needing a new HDD for ages and after watching this I remembered I used to have Sky so Ive since took it apart and stuck the HDD in my PC. Thanks a lot for bringing this to light, even though its obvious I wouldnt have thought of it.
retrogametech i found a jail broken ps3 in a gamestop dumpster the ps3 start fucking up after a few weeks so i just took that hdd out and put it in my other ps3
retrogametech Some really cool stuff , learned some cool stuff aswell like the harddrive test box.stay cool dude peace
retrogametech Excellent find and nicely salvaged! I wanted to message you but I noticed that I cant. Should I just post my query in the comments instead? Thats if you dont mind either way of course.
retrogametech I thought it was illegal in the UK to dumpster dive?
retrogametech Sometimes its good to have a break. Im on hiatus at the mo.
retrogametech how about a tech parts bin tour video??? id like to compare our different parts... why does that sound so wrong? S
retrogametech Good idea but unfortunately I already junked the housing. But thanks for reminding me! I really need to get that CMVS project back on track! haha.
retrogametech Seagate, belongs in the bin.
retrogametech Well, a ramble is better than nothing! I see those sky boxes all the time and never think to harvest them for parts. Just goes to show, never throw anything out. Great work, keep it up!
retrogametech Have you seen like american dumpster dives at gamestops? Have you ever tried doing it like Game or something?
retrogametech I guess its all subjective. I would disagree. As platformers go, I found it very bland and tedious in comparison to other GBA titles from the same genre. To me even the modern Nintendo platformers are subpar when compared to the likes of what WayForward and smaller indie devs are producing these days. Im a big platformer and Nintendo fan btw. All personal opinion of course! :)
retrogametech I checked for a new video a few hours ago, and now you upload one, hehe.
retrogametech Well it kinda is just a simplfied PC. It runs its own OS, has most of the common inputs and outputs etc
retrogametech Yo, score on that hard drive!
retrogametech Thanks for the Hard drive idea, went to car boot today and picked up a Sky HD Box (Samsung) for 5 and got a 300GB HDD out of it :) Going to do it again next week, looking for a Amstrad as they have 2TB1TB HDDs
retrogametech Its hard to believe but there are some out there. My advice, stay away from American Dragon Jake Long on the DS. Just saying.. :P
retrogametech these videos are great dont stop making them!
retrogametech what an awesome find, I applaud you on that. I saw a similar HDD on Amazon for around 60 bucks.
retrogametech Are you bored of gaming???? Maybe time to get rid of it all like i did :(
retrogametech My Sky box is rocking 3TB.
retrogametech That game looks like so much fun!! Ill have to get it!! Also good score on the Sky plus box, I wish mine was sitting on the dustbin for you to take its such a slow and clunky box compared to the older Sky boxes no wonder they threw it out :D The free hard drive is certainly the best part! Not used a dock with IDE built in before, looks great!
retrogametech 500gb Seagate Hard Drives sitting in those Sky boxes :D Thats how my PC has got 2 of them in it. 1tb of extra storage, For free :D
retrogametech Did you check if that hdd is still in warranty? you could rma it fro a brand new one. Doubt it is though since it was bought by another company.
retrogametech Hey your cool Im subbed :)
retrogametech Retro Relics lol we have a pot shop called that
retrogametech man you got some good deals, i wish i could get deals like that, and its weird to hear someone say north american imports, mostly cause i live in north america lol
retrogametech i have the same kinda aqua blue tealish GBC. it was a gift from my brother. it needs alot of cleaning. still works though. but it was a gift from my bro (along with Mega Man: Dr. Wilys Revenge) so im not reselling it any time soon.
retrogametech This may sound creepy, but I love your voice.
retrogametech Every now and then they end up selling failed addon peripherals like the GH on Tour bundle and that Rock Band keyboard for Wii. I found some really nice Halo 4 figures in there the other day for 4.
retrogametech 99p for ICO!!!!! dies
retrogametech Cheers dude! I agree about spines. They just look nicer with the art. I dont know how you guys in Australia cope with the crazy pricing of some games. Do you import much stuff yourself?
retrogametech you like the sims you sad bastard
retrogametech I never had a PS2 so missed out on Ico and Shadow of the Colossus. I had planned on getting the 2 pack PS3 HD port, but ended up getting it free on PS. I still havent played Ico yet but have really enjoyed Shadow, Im about halfway through.
retrogametech I dont really have any PC games. I could actually list all of them right here in this comment! :P GTA Vice City, Super Meat Boy and now The Sims Complete Collection. And I use a really lowend Acer Revo R3700 PC running Windows 7 for pretty much everything. Haha, the pics are mostly of old friends from school. Nothing of interest :P
retrogametech I thought that yellow Game Boy was a prototype at first because of the missing lettering. :P
retrogametech Hey man, love the channel, keep it up. Hope to see a new video soon.
retrogametech you can adjust the strap on the guitar hero grip. fits my ginormous hands, so shouldnt be a problem for you as well.
retrogametech A lovely woman owning a game gear ? Marry Me ! :D
retrogametech What will be your next faulty pickup.
retrogametech Do you have a Gameboy Advance Micro? Could you do a disassembly of it? as i cant find any on Youtube
retrogametech Already sold by the time the vid went live, sorry.
retrogametech Yeah, good luck with that :P
retrogametech Hi Martin. Ive been following your channel for about a year and I never took the time to write a comment about how good it is. I really enjoy your repair videos and all the obscure clone console stuff. Ive bought a copy of Guitar Hero On Tour (not the Decades version) for really cheap recently. My fingers hurts but Ive been able to make it to the final area in expert mode (but I dont think Ill be able to finish it). I Hope youll keep making fun videos.
retrogametech OMG! A Pokmon Mini!!! Ive got 2: a green one (played and used, completely funtional) and a blue one (touched only once to check if its working). FINALLY someone who has one!
retrogametech Cheers! Not bad huh? :)
retrogametech Woah good job on the gameboy
retrogametech Ive got a Manchester United limited edition Game Boy. Is this worth anything?
retrogametech No problem! :D I love your videos (and your accent :D). Im almost tempted to send a Game Gear to you to see what you can do about the screen, but sending it might be too much trouble unfortunately. :( Anyway, you have a gift. :D
retrogametech RetroGameTech there is a RARE JAPANESE PSX CONSOLE FOR SALE ON EBAY LINK: ebay.comitmSONYPSXDESR7000CONSOLE250GBHDDRecorderPlayStation2XPS2JapanGameRare171087135857 CHECK IT OUT THE CONSOLE IS RARE.
retrogametech Whatever I find cheap :)
retrogametech Later PAL DS games come in the smaller NTSC cases, at least the Pokemons did. I never got why Nintendo uses different cases in different regions, the ones that weird me out are the Gamecube where the Gamecube logo on the spine is on the bottom of NTSC copies, and the Wii U where the spine is white rather than blue in the PAL copies.
retrogametech I really enjoy watching your videos. I do also dislike the PAL DS games, guess i have to switch them out. :P BTW: the XG Blast amzn DOT to16vgGTB
retrogametech Honestly nothing beats a nice clean DMG :) Funny fact actually, we get the same DS cases in Australia, but we also get the black cases. Many businesses here import UK copies and sell them here at Australian release prices. The DS section looks better with the spine art, great video as always bro!
retrogametech 49.5p for ico. WOW. Another great video thanks
retrogametech My brother has a gameboy, Its blue, has duct tape all around the back because he lost the battery thing and the screen protector fell off XD Still works completely fin though.
retrogametech I was quite surprised that the Uk DS covers are the same size as The NTSC ones. Tempted to put my games in US boxes to save space.
retrogametech It does look a bit odd, haha. Kinda reminds me of a custom aftermarket shell or something.
retrogametech My local game in Irvine was doing the same deal and i managed to pick up dmc and final fantasy 12 for 99p and a ps2 slim for 10
retrogametech If you ever find an NTSC copy let me know! :)
retrogametech ICO is actually the prequel to Shadow of the Colossus.
retrogametech hey i was wondering how to save data on games like super mario land and Go Go Tank
retrogametech I have the standard on tour version of guitar hero DS :)
retrogametech I watched some comparison vids on the original VS remake of Ico. Youre definitely much better off with the PS3 version. I might try and hunt down the HD version instead. Ico seems like a pretty chilled out game. Not tried Shadow yet. You cant complain getting them free on PS :)
retrogametech Surprisingly Guitar Hero: On Tour Decades is a good game.
retrogametech Alright thanks man! Ive been watching, just not commenting. I was thinking of getting all the variants for my collection but didnt have money at that time.
retrogametech If you ever find an NTSC copy let me know! :)
retrogametech ICO is actually the prequel to Shadow of the Colossus.
retrogametech Martin, Id love to see your retro PC game collection and what sort of system you use to play old games with. Also would like to see the pictures you pulled off the GB Camera (if theyre not personal).
retrogametech RetroGameTech im a photo student in the states. i was wondering who made the game programer you used to get the pics of of you gameboy camera (model number would be good to). I would love to do a project with it.

retrogametech Alright thanks man! Ive been watching, just not commenting. I was thinking of getting all the variants for my collection but didnt have money at that time.
retrogametech Can we see the pictures you retrieved?
retrogametech I thought the same when I saw it on the shelf for 99p. Then I saw the buy one get one sticker... yoink! :P
retrogametech Its for GBC not GBA. But yes, although only to and from the flashcart, not other games. The USB version has all the programming hardware directly on the cartridge along with a USB port on the top.
retrogametech Thanks! I appreciate the nice comment :)
retrogametech subscribed. first time! great deal on the ico.
retrogametech I really surprised you dont already have one with a bunch of the games! haha You can still find lots of the games sealed on ebay pretty cheap. Dont see the system very often though. Going to hold onto mine for now I think. But Ill let you know if I decide to sell it. Nice to hear from you btw!
retrogametech I just noticed the size of your hand.
retrogametech Ico for 50p! What a deal!
retrogametech The bigger cases for PAL games (PS1,Dreamcast,DS) is usually down to them needing to fit the big European multilingual manuals inside.
retrogametech I know ive never seen any, going to go check mine out tomorrow
retrogametech Its brilliant! One of the best on DS. The PSP version is slightly better but overall its a great game. :)
retrogametech dont think ive ever seen a yellow OG gamboy before.. i left a pikachu themed gameboy colour at a shop for 7 quid, cos it had the wrong battery cover.. probably should have picked it up tho.. doh! i had one of the first gen tamagochi eggs.. a white and blue one.. i thought it was fucking amazing at the time.. blew my tiny little mind, so it did. lol
retrogametech Ive always wanted a pokemon mini!
retrogametech But was it really? Was it an official US release or just imported PAL copies? Ive never been able to find any US sellers that have an NTSC version of it. I cant even find a photo of a US copy. But, if it does exist then Id love to get it! :)
retrogametech OH WOAH I forgot I had that GameBoy Camera, Ill have to go into the attic and try to hoak it out.
retrogametech Loving the dedication to own Ping Pals :D
retrogametech I never knew they even existed until recently!
retrogametech Thanks! Hope you like the vids :)
retrogametech Just picked up Metal Slug 7 last weekend.
retrogametech Personally I cant stand it, haha. Thanks, though!
retrogametech Thanks, man! Youre the reason I got my GB Advance SP! Keep up the good work!
retrogametech Also is it time for your 2013 entertainment setup video now hint hint lol
retrogametech According to RetroCollect. com, you can now get a flash cart for the Pokemon Mini called the Pokecard.
retrogametech Bummer that you didnt get enough footage for the Pokemon system. Even if you were unable to revive it, it would have been interesting to see what the insides looked like. I love it when you teardown and refurbish hardware. :D Nice pickups.
retrogametech I actually had guitar hero on tour, similar to the one you have, and I thought it was pretty fun to play I was addicted to it for like a month, but I had to sell it once I bought the dis
retrogametech Thank you. Im glad you like them!
retrogametech I do but no reason to bust it open at the moment. Ill keep an eye out for some faulty units to repair though :)
retrogametech XG Blast NTSC is available on the American Amazon, not sure if theyll ship to the UK though
retrogametech that GB transferer i want to buy it ....
retrogametech Dammit the Pokemon Mini is so awesome though! Get a working one and do the backlight mod on it!
retrogametech I have to get some of these for myself! I hope I can find some that work too. . (and find money to buy them as well)
retrogametech Help me, ObiWan Kenobi. Youre my only hope.
retrogametech They also came in dark gray.
retrogametech I used to have a silver SP which was backlit and I sold it for 50 AUD
retrogametech I saw your video some time ago and found it very interesting. Today I finally got myself an AGS101 second hand (Im in New Zealand) and mine is similar to yours (Pearl Blue with Aus code) but has some extra writing underneath Use only AGS002 which says Production Year: 2007 and also has a slightly different code: CAGTAUS(E4)2. Curious!
retrogametech I literally found my ags 101 when I was 7(5 years ago) in a clothing shop under a stack of blue jeans. It had a few scratches at the time and it was lucky I even found myself a free sp.
retrogametech Oh hey I have one of these, i was watching one of your previous vids and wondering why you were saying that sps werent backlit, when mine was
retrogametech Where did you get this SP? Im amazed youve found one in such mint condition, and an Aussie one at that. Im pretty sure I remember seeing these in Aus when I was younger.
retrogametech Very cool find indeed.
retrogametech My friend has a backlit AGS 101. It also has the AUS code.
retrogametech I have a us version. i got it as a present when it was new.
retrogametech It had the 2 brightness settings and i could see it in the dark.
retrogametech Man has a Australia wish I could found these. Great video
retrogametech Ive seen a few backlit Aussie SPs on Ebay but they dont show up very often at all. Best bet is still the US model.
retrogametech doubt it was the blacklit model...
retrogametech o3o i have one of these and i just found out that it is special
retrogametech Hey Martin, do you know a good place to buy a AGS101 model besides ebay?
retrogametech I prefer not to advertise it, sorry. In the past Ive had lots of problems with people sabotaging auctions and generally harassing me. As a seller, I now keep away from ebay as much as possible. I also keep my username as private as possible.
retrogametech Looks no different than the Silver one I had, just as painful to use too lol.
retrogametech Martin I have a aus 101 in pink so we no there definitely 2 colours
retrogametech It was also released in China as iQue GBA SP, its official and it had backlit screen. AFAIK in only was in silver and purple
retrogametech Oh neat! Thats good to know! Might keep my eyes peeled for one if theyre not too hard to find.
retrogametech we have the model 101 in canada too :)
retrogametech If you keep away from eBay as a seller, where do you sell things?
retrogametech a sweet find mate, didnt know they existed :)
retrogametech I had one of those before the ds, not only that my mum got my sister one too!
retrogametech Does anyone have any idea if AGS101 exists in Japan? I cant find any here. I have a couple of famicom color SPs but they are front lit. Front lit screens SPs are a nice upgrade from the regular GBAs but compared to a back lit screen, it looks pretty terrible because the colors look so faded.
retrogametech FYI, there was also an Asian version for sale in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.
retrogametech my friend boy got 3 of this and my other friend got one of this also and its in philippines
retrogametech Australian AGS101 GBA SP data was added to the Nintendex! Australian AGS101 GBA SP: A backlit version of the GBA SP released in Australia. Rare and hard to find. It seems to come in Pearl Blue and has no Shiny variant yet.
retrogametech I have the ags 101 and ags 001
retrogametech I want an AGS 101. One day maybe :)
retrogametech i already know this they sold them in nz also
retrogametech Had an AGS001 as a kid and I recently found it in my garage. Also found an AGS101 on the sidewalk near school, pocketed it. I also have a Micro. Just need to find that damn original GBA I used to own and Ill have the set.
retrogametech i have a backlin 101 model, how much does it go for on ebay?
retrogametech Its not rare at all unless it has the AGS101 model number on the back.
retrogametech Lol I have one of these.
retrogametech it came in a dark green, and dark blue
retrogametech I have an Arctic Blue AGS101 which says AGS001 on the back.
retrogametech Interesting to see the Australian variant ended up over here!
retrogametech im not sure why you find this so weird this was the normal console for kids in my day (yes in Australia)
retrogametech I remember my cousin having one too ) (Im Canadian as well P)
retrogametech Very cool! Definitely have to get me one of those 101s one day.
retrogametech i got two of these, the European surfblue that is.
retrogametech I had one of these and I gave it to my little cousin.... Ima go run to his house and take it back (x
retrogametech I have the axact same AUS model. Its the graphite color one with an EU charger lol. Bought from a guy from Singapore who bought it from ToysRuS back in 2005. :D
retrogametech My brother had one, tribal edition...
retrogametech Try amazon or or a store called the exchange if you have one.
retrogametech Hi I have a SP with this tribal black things over it. it says AUS on the back is it rare or super rare?
retrogametech I thought they all had a light plus all the newr ones just added another brightness
retrogametech So your saying these were quite rare? i had two when i was 7 and i live in the uk
retrogametech in small markets as Greece ebay is my friend.
retrogametech Whats your ebay username?
retrogametech What kind of flat screen is that where 4:3 is available?
retrogametech Enjoying watching these repair videos. I know you say you go to ebay to buy your broken console but have you even been to a Cash generator shop to buy their spare parts section items?
retrogametech I probably have ADHD but thats a Much better way to.. HEY! A Sega Master System.
retrogametech There is this pirated console called the xgame 360 which is a ripoff of the xbox 360, you should check it out
retrogametech Well done! Never hurts to have a parts devices for your consoles in case they develop issues later on.
retrogametech Love the vids, keep up the great work
retrogametech great job martin, i would have done the same thing, that first neogeo just didnt seems like it was worth repairing so using it for parts seems like a good idea )
retrogametech No, my PC is barely capable of rendering these videos! haha.
retrogametech Haha, well someone got a good deal :P
retrogametech I was like that isent damaged oh  it is
retrogametech This video is painful to watch. I was the other guy bidding on them, and the app on my phone decided not to tell me I was outbid.
retrogametech there is a reason why this type of work costs alot, you have to factor in the cost of parts, resources, shipping to and from aswell as labor, it takes alot of time to do mods where soldering is involved
retrogametech I will look into that. Thank you.
retrogametech PS: i love that megadrive switch on the neo, thats awesome dude :D
retrogametech Ive done a few vids on my setup in the past if youre interested :) . The main unit has a Bravia with SLG3000 for the retro gear. MVS gets hooked up to a Trinitron. I test all my repairs on the Bravia.
retrogametech Haha, thanks dude. It fit surprisingly well!
retrogametech what is your mane on ebay? and do you ship to denmark
retrogametech learn electronics aswell as soldering and desolder, check out eevblog on youtube for a really good soldering tutorial
retrogametech Im not entirely sure but I think the standard Unibios has a lot more features over the debug. The features of each should be listed on the website.
retrogametech hey what kind of tv are you using to play those games? looks like an lcd
retrogametech I have a whole closet full of to sell things and the pile keeps getting bigger and bigger.
retrogametech Is the unibios really worth the extra money compared to a debug bios? Debug20 uni40
retrogametech How long did it take to learn how to do this sort of work? I would like to learn how to work with my own consoles and Im about to start computer tech classes at a community college. Hopefully that will be a good start.
retrogametech Haha, that faulty Mega Drive from the shed has now fixed and helped me mod so many other systems. Good old SEGA! XD Thanks for watching and commenting :)
retrogametech I actually used to do a lot of modsrepairs for other people. But theres really no money in it. You have to factor in the time spent on each job. Forget about repairs, just diagnosing a fault can take hours! And even seemingly simple jobs canwill eat up the hours. Then of course theres the cost of parts, materials and shipping etc. In most cases just to earn the equivalent to the UKs legal hourly minimum wage, Id have to charge people far more than theyd be willing to pay. Not worth it IMO
retrogametech Is that picture run through an upscaler? It looks fantastic
retrogametech Nice but you have to work on getting an older TV D
retrogametech Nice. Interesting that the system had sound issues from that one pin as the last 2pins are ground pins in both sides and it should have had some sound but none the less the bios does take time to replace traces, did that once lol. The reason why one neo needed all those parts is because it was a 5v model which is missing components but will only run on 5v although you can modify them to work on 9v, Ive done that with quite a few but some people really love the 5v models for MS X MVS on on 5v
retrogametech Out of curiosity have you considered doing modsrepairs for other people? I know theres a few people who already do that professionally but usually ridiculously overpriced for the work involved for some things.
retrogametech Yay, at least you got one good one out of the two!
retrogametech I bought a modchipped xbox at the swapmeet maybe little under a year ago, Been a bitch to work with, I paid 10 but the parts ive put into it really kills it, and the harddrives pretty rotten from previous owner. 120gbs but its dying forsure, motherboard had grime and rust on it, entire inner metal shell was rust. Had to have been living outside or something.
retrogametech Haha cheaper aye!! Dont we all mate!! :p Thats why most of my neo geo games consist of MVS carts..
retrogametech Nice work mate! I did a similar fix on a damage AES I received a while ago and I still own it! Works a treat! :) btw you dont happen to be on the bordersdown forums do you?
retrogametech Your videos rock! I think the powerswitch modification should add to the value as now it has parts from the mighty Mega Drive! bows before his 4 Megadrives
retrogametech Yeah there was some sound but it was distorting and glitching out. I discovered that any time the cart was moved it caused issues. Putting pressure on that spot with the crack fixed stopped the distortion. Haha, there was no way I was going to spend a whole day reworking the mess under that BIOS chip. Yep, the other board was a 5V unit but had 1 bad transistor on the daughter board. The replacement part was going to cost me 10 with shipping! Easiercheaper just to convert the board to 9V :)
retrogametech The way I see it I got paid 40 for 2 hours work with a Unibios and parts board thrown in for free. :P The parts board will almost certainly be put to good use in future. :)
retrogametech nice work dude. yea, its surprising it didnt fetch more, but nice to see you do the auction, i prefer that method, to give buyers a chance at a bargain. with an AES, theres such expense involved with the game collecting, i guess there arent that many who are battling to get the machines in the first place.. maybe. or i could be talkin bollocks. lol
retrogametech I suppose one way to look at it is you will have a spares board full of working parts ifwhen you repair more of them.
retrogametech Nice to see that at least one of them will find a new home in fully working condition. I expected it to sell for a bit more though.
retrogametech I was watching this on ebay, i was really tempted to bid. But decided not to because of the price of the games.
retrogametech True. Might be able to use some parts off it to fix a faulty MVS board I have :) . Sadly the amount of hours it would have taken to get properly repaired wouldnt have been worth it in the end. Maybe if the cart slot hadnt been cracked it would have been a different story. Thanks for commenting as always! much appreciated :)
retrogametech I saw your AES on ebay and must admit being tempted cos I know youd have done a quality job fixing it up.
retrogametech Thanks, Ed. I think the damaged corner and ghetto power switch probably killed the value :P. I would have expected a little more for it too but the market seems really dead right now. Especially on expensive nonessential items like an AES. Considering what I paid for it I was kinda tempted just to keep it for myself. But need the cash and space more than a Neo Geo right now, haha. And I have a bad habit of buying stuff to sell then keeping it for my own collection! :P
retrogametech Wow who ever had that Geo before you really hurt it :( glad you got a nice profit in the end! I should blog the two xboxes I got and the out come :) nice video man!
retrogametech How much do these go for with no damage in fully working condition? I dont mean mint, but just all original parts and no chipped plastic.
retrogametech Typically an AES in working condition, no damage with all the bits, unboxed, sells upwards of 150. Boxed with some games and youre talking 250300
retrogametech Maybe, 90 to send it out to the guy in the UK, so I still need to think it over.
retrogametech In the end I actually just listed it as a buy it now with best offer. There wasnt much interest so I just discounted it to sell. Someone got a very nice deal though :) . I think the problem is, anyone dedicated enough to invest in the expense of Neo Geo AES collecting, is probably going to do it properly and buy themselves a really nice clean undamaged console. My refurb unit would only be good for straight up gamers or to someone as a secondary backup system.
retrogametech I saw this on ebay but was put off by the chip and the megadrive power switch, if i had known somebody as good as you repaired it i would of been in.
retrogametech Theyre really solid machines! :) I just wish the games were a bit cheaper! Not on the forums, nope.
retrogametech I still have mine that doesnt work lol.
retrogametech Thanks! Its always really cool to hear when someone enjoys the content and discovers something new because of it. :) Yes, mostly selftaught through trial and error and Googling anything I dont understand. Fixing the old consoles isnt very difficult :) Thanks for watching and taking the time to comment!
retrogametech Wouldve been more convenient to have a setting you can toggle instead of doing that each time
retrogametech I wonder if the power light will flicker when the 3DS is low on battery.
retrogametech I try it tomorrow lucky for me I got a gameboy color game maybe it could work for sega game gear game too.
retrogametech Wow, I didnt know about this! Thanks!
retrogametech Even works on dsi games and ds games. :)
retrogametech You dont actually need to press select if you only press start it works too
retrogametech Its not really an Easter egg. It says in the manual
retrogametech Exactly what I though when I found out about it.
retrogametech Its a brilliant game and probably one of the best 8bit platformers every made. The original is extremely rare and highly sought after so commands crazy prices )
retrogametech Hey RGT what ROM carts are you using? are they any good? i have been looking for a ROM cart for use with my GBA and i have not decided on what to use.
retrogametech Same. The 3D effect is serioulsy cool and a very nice little bonus. I think the same effect would work perfectly on arcade ports. Replace that GameBoy border with an arcade cab and it would be great! Just like a CRT with a perspex cover :) Yeah I think an XL would be the better option in all games. Im holding out for a good deal to upgrade :)
retrogametech Martin have u being getting my pms as msg u a few times
retrogametech Nice one I didnt know about this at all! Ill need to go back and try all my VC games :)
retrogametech its actually JUST start, its Start and Select to ALL DS and DSi ware games and makes them on their native resolutions, though on a regular 3DS, its WAY too small, looks OK on a XL
retrogametech Yeah, I was hoping you could too but sadly no option for that.
retrogametech Is would be so cool if you could choose color of the gameboycolor
retrogametech btw, you can do that trick by holding either start or select you dont have to hold both. And whats more is that on the 3DS XL, the 1:1 screen is the same physical size as a gameboy color! I put mine up to it to be sure! So with the 1:1 pixel ratio and at that size, it really is like looking at my actual GBC, but with a backlight. Also, I just have to know where did you get that flash cart thats in the GBA SP? If it can run Shantae perfectly, I would love to have one!
retrogametech I... have no clue really.
retrogametech Great little gen you discovered. Ive not bought any virtual console games. But thats pretty neat. I wouldnt have bothered researching it either so I doubt Id have come across the feature. Thanks! Btw have you heard about the Sega SMS classics being released on 3DS with their 3D depth added back again? Pretty cool!
retrogametech hey i just got a psp 2000 from ireland and im in the usa i was wondering if theres any advantage to having a pal psp considering i think its import friendly
retrogametech You own 2 copies of Shantae?
retrogametech just got a 3ds and downloaded Shantae its an amazing game. have you tried the game gear ports on the system they have that option in the menu for screen resolution.
retrogametech I bet that 3d feature looks great in person!
retrogametech For GBA you should definitely look into getting an EZFlash IV. I did a video on it a while back. But for GBGBC youll needwant GB USB smart card 64M. Hope that helps! :)
retrogametech The question, then, is why they couldnt just use the GBA emulator that the 3DS has. If that thing can play Wario Land 4 and Fire Emblem, why cant it play some GBA enhanced games?
retrogametech I used to own a gameboy color and a few others but I discontinued them
retrogametech Time to support WayForward with their Kickstarter for Shantae: HalfGenie Hero!!
retrogametech I went to go find Shantae in the eShop after watching this video and the promotional artwork in the shop for the game includes a giant screenshot of the game with the Gameboy Color border around it :D
retrogametech if you read the manual it will tell you on all GB VC games
retrogametech Thats an interesting accent you have there. What part of England are you from?
retrogametech hey, i can guess you backed the new gen of Shantae on Kickstarter, what level do you have? as in which level did you back as well, and what do you think of the redesign for that said game for Shantae?
retrogametech look at the where on the game boy color buttons
retrogametech Im not bother either way . Its written as Color on the console itself so not much point worrying about it. :P
retrogametech Get a faulty one and make a video about it :)
retrogametech Thats cool. I did not know that. it makes the game rather small though unless you have the 3DS with the larger top screen which sadly I do not. :( But its rather neat!
retrogametech Im guessing youre a big fan of WayForward. I dont blame, I love their games!
retrogametech Thanks for uploading this trick! Really cool easter egg! I actually just bought Shantae last night and this is definitely the way Ill be playing the rest of the game. I actually got into WayForward because of YOU! I heard the background music you were playing of Mighty Switch Force in one of your videos and it lead me all the way to Shantae. :) Keep the videos coming! Your channel is great!
retrogametech it is definately interesting but i would rather stretch the picture to full screen that make it even smaller, i dont like having these black bars, but yeah thats just me xD
retrogametech if you hold down select while selecting the game it will make the screen smaller sorting out the image problems
retrogametech I always enjoy watching your videos. I always learn new stuff about game consoles.
retrogametech Thats really neat with the 3D depth thing. Nintendo oneupped the PC emulation gurus by adding that, methinks.
retrogametech I just tried it with the Mario Kart Advance (from the ambassador program) and whilst it displays the game in the native resolution there isnt a GBA surround, just blackness :(
retrogametech I love how you scrutinize and really care about the resolution and aspect ratio!i dont have a 3ds but I will pretty soon, the one I purchased is faulty but a lil bit of work an iam sure it will be right as rain. Thanks for some insight on the systems properties :)
retrogametech Cheers. I only really buy from within the UKEurope so I dont get hit with any custom charges etc. I try to avoid selling on ebay these days due to high fees and zero support for sellers if things go wrong.
retrogametech Thats awesome thanks man.
retrogametech You are indeed a strange person! :P 4:3 FTW!
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Cool! The game also looks like a good one. :)
retrogametech I have demo this before as well and it is nice
retrogametech i didnt know about this game... just saw this price of it on ebay O
retrogametech Hey man , really enjoy your videos youre an inspiration for retro consoles collecting! I was wondering if the consoles you order from ebay or amazon come from the us or asia etc..how much do the UK charge you at customs for tax and all? also are you a seller on ebay?cheers
retrogametech yay befor 301 views love your videos
retrogametech I knew about the DS native resolution trick, but I had no idea you could also do it on the virtual console games. I imagine on a 3DSXL it would be a slightly better experience with the bigger screen.
retrogametech Cheers! Glad you like them :)
retrogametech actually you just need to hold start dude, select is unneeded
retrogametech Great tip,I wonder if nes virtual console games do anything special like GB colour games.
retrogametech Not sure if youre trolling me but Im Scottish.
retrogametech Excellent info! The blurred default setting also bothers me its great to know that theres this pixel perfect resolution that allows GBGBC games to look as they were originally. Thanks!
retrogametech Wouldnt you prefer colour spelled thus?
retrogametech Thanks for watching. Hope you get it running without too much work! :) Its a great console.
retrogametech The 3D feature is a very nice idea. I wonder why they dont do a better job of advertisingpromoting these features!
retrogametech So cool Nintendo included that hidden feature in 3DS :)
retrogametech please can u do a 3ds review video because Im thinking of getting one
retrogametech Glad I could help. It really bothers me too!
retrogametech Very cool and useful! Good video :D
retrogametech Haha, thats great! Another WayForward fan because of me. :D They make some really amazing games. Thanks for watching and supporting the channel! :)
retrogametech I appreciate the support! :)
retrogametech Unfortunately it would still be the wrong resolution and youd also lose the cool 3D effect. But I see what youre saying.
retrogametech Could you recommend some GB Cards? Any Names?
retrogametech Thats... actually a pretty dick move.
retrogametech Im guessing we can not get the Tinkerbat transformation in the 3DS Version huh?
retrogametech Haha, the biggest! I have most of their releases. Some of the best games Ive ever played.
retrogametech 3ds xl works so much better with this.
retrogametech That would be really cool to see! I hope they also release the Virtual Boy games. Its crazy they havent done it already!
retrogametech If youre asking whether or not the Virtual Console rerelease of Shantae is the GBA enhanced version, then sadly the answer is no. The only way to experience the game in its full original form is still to find an original cart (or flashcart P) and play it on a GBA. Reading a recent interview with Matt Bozon, I think it was possibly done intentionally to maintain the original releases desirability and value.
retrogametech Am I the only one who can hear that loud squealing? Sounds like a CRT going bad. Maybe Im just sensitive to the high pitched noise in my old age, but it made the video unwatchable. No thumbs down, though, probably just myself hearing it.
retrogametech Haha, well I appreciate you listeningwatching me ramble regardless. Tbh, half the time I dont really understand what Im talking about either. :P
retrogametech I ordered a 360 HDDVD drive the other day from CeX, inc 3 discs total cost delivered was 12.50 :) It arrived today, Im very happy with it. I couldnt get discs to play on my laptop (laptop is too old), but the films (Apollo 13, The Big Lebowski  The Thing) all work well when connected to the 360. I picked those 3 films as the bluray versions actually look worse (DNR issues). But I doubt Ill be stocking up on titles, unless I can find another HDDVD addon for backup (oos online now at CeX).
retrogametech 32X isnt that good, I know its the hip thing to say, but its is true, there are a few, very few good things on it. I dont like C.C., but DooM 32X and Star Wars Arcade, those are good.
retrogametech You try grounding the 32x on the ground spots? I know mine would have issues if I didnt install the gound plates that came with the 32x.
retrogametech this video has a really high ringing sound permeating it. its quite offputting.
retrogametech Thanks :) The wireless pads are great. Featured them in a pickups vid last year I think. About November time if youre interested.
retrogametech I really enjoy these videos but I really dont understand any of the technical stuff.. Im such a typical girl lol
retrogametech worth a try dude. great vid!
retrogametech Exactly my thoughts! lol.
retrogametech Thanks. I didnt permanently mod anything on the clone ) . Just soldered a few wires in place to grab RGB and disable the forced 50Hz video. After making the vid I reversed everything back to stock.
retrogametech Have you tried an every drive with it?
retrogametech When you said sonic three was too fast, you mean it was even faster than the north american version? Or was it only the first sonic game that had different playback speeds between regions?
retrogametech Another interesting video, i thought you wasnt going to modify that little piece of unusual gaming historical memorabilia? Im glad for the attempts though! Always a pleasure to watch these videos! I still cant believe Beaties sold that though! I remember going into it moderately often when I was young, never saw that though :(
retrogametech No, I dont know what that is.
retrogametech See my reply to Darius Davis below :)
retrogametech What!? No love for the 32X? Cosmic Carnage, dude! Haha
retrogametech What is that high pitched background sound in this video? It drives me nuts.
retrogametech Haha, not at all. :) I just find it interesting that you and a couple other viewers were able to hear something I wasnt even aware of. I must be getting old! :P Thanks for watching and taking the time to comment. I really appreciate it.
retrogametech So close! haha. Its a sync issue but I have no clue how to correct it. I also suspect the CPU in the clone might be clocked differently to a real MD and that is whats causing the issues. Who knows :P
retrogametech Have you managed to get in contact with Gary Smoke? Maybe he can somehow answer this problem, or at least direct you to the people who manufactured it and maybe they would know?
retrogametech Thanks dude. Apart from that video of the guy using his Scorpion with a 32X Ive not come across anyone else trying it. I think he mentioned his was modded back to NTSC. But it seems that without switching out componentshardware, the 32X and Scorpion are not compatible. Im probably just missing something really obvious though! :P
retrogametech I havent, no. Id guess he only dealt with translating the instructions to English for the company who made the console.
retrogametech awesome video, Ive wanted a scorpion ever since I seen one on a video game Television program years and years ago, Youre a ninja with the tech stuff, I always learn a ton from your videos!
retrogametech Will it work with both NTSC and PAL?
retrogametech I wonder why Sonic 3 didnt work?
retrogametech Great video Martin. Thinking the same about the sync. but the freezing shouldnt happen... Wonder if maybe the clock speeds arent matching up. Are the crystalsoscillators rated at the same speed Orig. MD  Scorpion)? Btw, (must have missed..)...what Country is the Scorpion from?
retrogametech I agree. Its looking like the Scorpions CPU clock is slightly mismatched with what the 32X can reliable work with. Ive seen someone else get it to work but have no details on how. Id guess the oscillator needs switched.
retrogametech Tried all of those. The last one usually works best :)
retrogametech I stumbled across this channel from Zero Wing music somehow... At any rate I love your technical videos! They are interesting to watch and they make me feel more intelligent that I really am, haha. Good work bud!
retrogametech It did, just forced through 60Hz making it a little too fast. Region protection prevents it from playing in NTSC mode.
retrogametech Not to sound dumb but it might be the fact that the system itself was intended to play at 50hz so thats why the 32x had complications. But what do i know.
retrogametech Great video, well you did get further than bad influnce ever did :) are you aware that here is also an 8 bit scorpion
retrogametech Well it half worked I guess :D nice to know she will be stock once more so you can appreciate her for the holy grail of clones she is :D
retrogametech Retrogametech!!! (Sorry, But i dont know your name), you are know about Super Retro trio ???
retrogametech Hey Martin. Cool little project mate. Have you tries to build a sync stripperseparator like the one built with the LM1881 like the one on mmmonkeys website?. That might get the the image to stabilise.
retrogametech love watching your videos have you got any videos or know how to get a ps2 net work adapter mod i dont want to pay 30 for a real network adapter lol is there such a mod?
retrogametech I thought everdrives regions didnt matter, anyways never stop making videos please.
retrogametech wow looks like your almost their,sonic 3 and streets of rage 3 had special lock out technology applied to them stoping them working on ntsc mega drives,my friend had a Japanese mega drive and he brought sonic 3 day of release and could not play it on his mega drive i think it was the blue line of pal mega drive games that had this lock out technology but definitely sonic 3 and streets of rage 3,keep up the good work.was gonna ask are the wireless md joy pads and good? could you do a video please
retrogametech Fun but a little infuriating at the same time. I was mostly just worried about damaging the 32X :P
retrogametech Haha, get used to it :P
retrogametech You cant make Sonic run too fast.. Dont be silly...
retrogametech Thanks. Due to the freezing I doubt it is a video sync issue. I think it is probably the CPU of the clone being clocked too fast or slow for the 32X.
retrogametech Haha, I suppose. It was fun trying :) Thanks for watching!
retrogametech good effort mate. never mind eh? have you come across anyone else on the internet whos tried to do this to a scorpion?
retrogametech I dont have one but I dont think it would make a difference. Ive tested games from all regions and get the same synctiming issues.
retrogametech Never thought Id hear you say it doesnt work!
retrogametech Getting even a vague form of life from the 32x on unofficial hardware is achievement enough! Good job!
retrogametech Well done mate, i think its the first video of yours i have seen without a 100 happy ending.
retrogametech Ahh! Too bad on that man. Interesting enough that it does somewhat play though. Well at least you own one of these in box :) Gary Smoke might be able to help in dot points lol awesome vid!
retrogametech Im impressed you got the 32X working at all on a clone machine. The 32X is EXTREMELY picky when it comes to signal quality from the MD. I had to modify my VA4 PAL MD to give cleaner data signals to the 32X from the MD, otherwise the 32X wouldnt run reliably.
retrogametech Damn that looks complicated the only complicated thing Ive ever done is backlight a gbc
retrogametech i cant finish watching its a great video but there is a loud white noise coming some the video. thought i might tell you in case anyone else found it but still great video man
retrogametech Close but not quite there. I bet it was quite fun to hack around in any case :)
retrogametech sorry if i offended you, it wasnt meant to come across like that, the noise wasnt annoying it just caught my attention, at first i thought it was my headphones or the connection between the headphones and the computer. which is why i asked, loving your vids man and keep up the good work!!! :) again, sorry for the over exaggeration :)
retrogametech You must be relatively young if CRT whine is audible enough for you to distinguish in this vid let alone be annoyed by it! haha I didnt notice it while making the recording and cant even hear it in the final video!
retrogametech Hey Thomas! I was thinking the same about the Scorpions CPU clock being slightly off and causing an issue with the 32X. As you said, the freezing shouldnt happen if it was just a video sync problem. The oscillator rating on the clone is indeed different to that of my original MD. Now Im tempted to switch it out and test! haha Regular MD games have the same issue while played via 32X on Scorpion. Personally I believe the Scorpion is a Taiwanese clone. But nothing concrete to back that up.
retrogametech Thats not a video sync issue imo. The game locking up and the background scrolling with glitches lends itself to the same conclusion. Id suggest the 32x is having problems communicating with the Scorpion.
retrogametech I love your accent.. I love how you say console. Consoooo haha Love your videos.
retrogametech Well, its the 32X so nothing of value has been lost lol.
retrogametech He got so lost on the keyboard Im surprised he found his way to the dislike button. Hope he got out ok.
retrogametech Try jiggling it about and turning it off and on again andor bang the tv and kick the PSU. I heard repeated shouting expletives work great too. :)
retrogametech why blend it if u cant make it smaller and why not blend sega cd uee just rewand all that make it hand hend or it a waste
retrogametech Cheers Jeff! Good to see you back on YT!
retrogametech aaaam watch?vWoX8odhoE
retrogametech Will It Blend that is the question
retrogametech See my reply to Darius Davis below :)
retrogametech Aye, exactly what I was thinking!..... Wait, what?
retrogametech i am a guy and dont understand that stuff so relax
retrogametech Great video! Probably need to get a scope or logic analyser onto the case here. (posted this before but it seems to have got deleted???).
retrogametech make it hand hend blend why not make hend hand made? then rewand why not potter man harry
retrogametech is it just me, or is there a horrible high pitch noise during the video??? great vid by the way
retrogametech but when blend hend blend why can make sega dreamblend 2! ur hend hand blend smaller cause if u cant make blend sega cd blender just rewand ur games from toaster scrambled blended eggs
retrogametech you should get driver for the wii was very fun :p
retrogametech resident evil 4 and speed racer is very good as they are very action arcade like games. metroid other m is bad. get target terror and just dance 1.
retrogametech That cover art for RE4 is amazing. So much cooler than the north american version.
retrogametech Suggestions: Sin  Punishment is a cant miss game. Mad World is another great game, Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World is pretty good for an RPG. Deadly Creatures isnt too bad either...Billy Bob Thornton and Dennis Hopper do the voice acting in it.I can also tell you a game not to get....Alone in the Dark. I dont care what anyone says about broken controls in a game, the driving controls in this game are the worst in gaming. Dont believe me, play the game and judge for yourself. In this game, you literally have to luck your way through a level. Youll spend hours wrecking a car that only response to you about 25 of the time, only to completely skip over a whole level at the end...yes that broken of a game...
retrogametech hi good day the red steel game . have you had a chance to use the motion plus controller compared to the old one .. and if you have is they any difference to the game play .
retrogametech Get Manhunt 2! The best! And Resident Evil Archives!
retrogametech No More Heroes is a good Wii game, not a quite sure it is a hidden gem but its defiantly worth checking out. I remember buying it for I think 2.50 a few years ago so it should be just as cheap now. I havent played the sequel but Ive heard thats good too.
retrogametech Hey Martin, I just started collecting the more obscure games or hidden gems for the ps3 and because I took your advice on a few of your hidden gem wii games I was wondering if you were collecting at all for the ps3? There are some games that are less known and great games. Thanks!
retrogametech Youve been watching Metal Jesus hidden gems video.
retrogametech Get House of the Dead Overkill, and Dead Space  both awesome! The Resident Evil ones are great as well  Unbrella Chronicles (theres another RE on rails shooter I forget the name of).
retrogametech RE4 wii edition is the ultimate edition of RE4, feature wise. Its got better graphics over the cube and ps2 version, motion control, and most importantly, all the extra modes the ps2 version got.
retrogametech Dead Space on the Wii is one of my favorite games. :) Ill have to check out the Neo compilations. Cheers!
retrogametech Got ps3 but I still love my wii. You should get xenoblade, its the best game for wii. I also love call of duty 4 for wii
retrogametech Also check out Metal Jesus Rocks. I think he has 3 Wii hidden gems vids that helped me out alot. Also the guys cool as fuck.
retrogametech Id say xenoblade, but finding a cheap copy will be pretty difficult.
retrogametech it wasnt as good as the original but was a great game
retrogametech Over here cheapest games i can find are 9,99  or sometimes 4,99  (If its sport game or game for 5 year old kids)
retrogametech Just to mention few: De Blob 2, Nights journey into dreams,Onechanbara,Okami,Project Zero2,Sin and Punishment,sonic sega allstars racing,Western Heroes. the Crash games are good ports too. So many to list :) I also quite like all the hunting games. Works really well with the wiimote controls. Just need to buy one of those gun holders.
retrogametech Thanks. Ill check it out :)
retrogametech Miss the older platforms now its all about DLC and screwing the gamers out of as much cash as possible.
retrogametech I actually like Red Steel, Red Steel 2 is a lot better though
retrogametech Sonic Colours is pretty great if you havent already played it, not exactly a hidden gem but it certainly gets my recommendation.
retrogametech no more heros is really good
retrogametech Bit.trip will do that to you, the rage quit LOL but it really does remind me of old school games in its difficulty. And yes, Fragile Dreams is the one that scared me, I was playing it in a dark candlelit room alone just to let my imagination run away (I watch horror movies the same way)
retrogametech I was exactly the same until just recently. Only had about 7 games for the longest time. Then I realised just how cheap the good games had become! :) Theres a few vids on YouTube highlighting the uncommon mustplay titles if youre looking for ideas. Users Metal Jesus and TVandLust spring to mind. I guess it just depends on what you like.
retrogametech Yeah, I live in Braizil too. Everything is expensive as fuck, and electronics even more.
retrogametech Had my Wii since its launch and have always struggled to find games for it. At any one time Ive only had up to 10 games for it, and currently have 5 games including Twilight Princess, Super Mario Galaxy (which if Im honest I became bored with quickly) Wii Sports and the two Pikmin Gamecube ports. Ill have to have a look around and see if I can find some cheap games to expand on my modest game library.
retrogametech xD Ive had mine done for ages too! Its so convenient!
retrogametech Xenoblade Chronicles is by far the best game on the system.
retrogametech Wow, nice selection of game to add to the list! cheers! Haha Onechanbara. I saw that the other day for 2 and didnt know if I should or not. I already have it on the 360 but the Wii controls are a ton of fun for that game! I kinda regret not getting it now. I love the lightgun shooters. Got myself an Overkill Hand Cannon a while back in one of the sales. I dont see so many hunting games here sadly. I dont think many got released in the UK for whatever reason.
retrogametech I have been currently playing Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of The Moon, and tbh seriously enjoying it. Also, take a look at No More Heroes 1 and 2 :D RedSteel 2 is also great but you will want the motion plus adapter for that one. If you want some difficult and very strange retro gameplay take a look at bit.trip complete. I have been doing the same, cruising the 2nd hand shops and picking up wii games for 15 dollars :) Perfect time to start collecting for the console :D
retrogametech Neo geo collection a must have mate....
retrogametech Is that a remake of the arcade game?
retrogametech true but a region free option is available via a softmod so we too can enjoy collecting ntsc (if that flaots your boat) :)
retrogametech The sims castaway, it is honestly such a great game!
retrogametech I didnt care much for dead space on the Wii. It was alright.
retrogametech My Wii turns on by itself, what should i do?
retrogametech even if you dont like mario, try out super mario galaxy its one of the best 3d platformers ive ever played, it doesnt play like classic mario
retrogametech Thanks for the suggestions! Im wondering the same thing about the prices. Will the better games start to become hard to find and expensive? It seems to be the trend with the Nintendo consoles. Just look at how popular GameCube has become.
retrogametech Try and pick up Disaster Day of Crisis  its really good..and can be picked up for a few quid. another great video
retrogametech Wii party, muramasa, and definitively super smash brothers brawl!!
retrogametech Ive played it but like I mentioned Im really not into Mario. I know theyre well made games but they hold no nostalgia for me and I actually really dislike the art style. Dont ask why, the wee guy just irritates me, haha.

retrogametech hi im a big fan. I have a question. What soldiering iron do you use. You inspired me to fix things and i need a good soldering iron
retrogametech also you should find sonic colors, super smash bros, mario kart, donkey kong country returns, and metroid prime 3( i got that game for 3 dollars)
retrogametech Cool pick ups man! Its really the time to go after Wii games right now, they can be had for next to nothing right now!
retrogametech Yes, before Nintendo started incorporating Wii MotionPlus into the Wiimote, it came as a separate sensor attachment that clips onto the controller.
retrogametech Yeah, Ive heard a few people say its good. Does it use the Wiimotes motion sensor to control the car?
retrogametech Bargaintastic!! Ghost squad can be picked up cheap and is a great gun game, BUT just read that you already have it :))
retrogametech Dokapon Kingdom is really good if you can manage to find 3 friends to play with!
retrogametech So Ive heard. It seems to be very highly regarded.
retrogametech would you be up for doing a swap for EPIC MICKEY 3 AND BLOB FOR EITHER HALO 4 OR GOLDEN AXE 2 AND SONIC 1 UNBOXED
retrogametech Thanks! Well technically its no longer the current gen system from Nintendo and theyve been dropping support for it so yeah I guess its now classed retro. But in saying that, Ive never claimed this channel was about or limited to one specific topic or genre. Maybe tomorrow Ill review some TV shows or do some gardening tutorials :P
retrogametech If you have your wii softmodded id suggest trying the ScummVM interpreter if youre into point and click adventures. I found the Wii mote to be a perfect controller for these type of games. There is also a compilation of the Bit Trip Wiiware games called Bit Trip Collection on disc. Its a very addictive Atari 2600 era influenced PongDefender hybrid and you control the paddle by holding the wiimite horizontal and tilting it forwards and backwards.
retrogametech wow... I can only dream of paying 0.99 for a game in Brazil, even an used game is pretty expensive
retrogametech Ive been on the look out for Sin and Punishment for a while :) . Its not so easy to find in the wild and goes for quite a lot on ebay. It looks really good. Cheers for the suggestions!
retrogametech the first is so much better
retrogametech Got it and love it! The House of the Dead games are reason enough to buy a Wii :)
retrogametech by the way since u said in one of your videos that you are gonna backlit everything you can, what you think about the new trend backlighting original GBA, I think its kinda overpriced, ill wait a few for a price drop, but its just maybe only one person is offering the kits
retrogametech Well unless your going to pick up the vita version, You totally need Muramasa The Demon Blade
retrogametech Any cheap 30W iron with a fine tip from ebay gets most jobs done.
retrogametech Sin  Punishment, Muramasa, Okami, Kirbys Epic Yarn, No More Heroes 1 and 2, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption (way better than Other M), definitely Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Super Paper Mario .... There are so many really good games for Wii that are really inexpensive! Nows a great time to pick em up!
retrogametech If you DO get Red Steel 2, you will need the Wii Motion Plus addon in order to play it, just a headsup for you
retrogametech Yeah, in fragile dreams, you are a kid... and out of everything, I got ripped apart by a pack of wild dogs while trying to walk through a subway. The story really drew me in, sort of like watching a movie. Not sure about the replay value, but for a first go the game is pretty good :)
retrogametech red steel 2 is amazing
retrogametech Never came out over here, Excite trucks almost as good though I guess (also really cheap)
retrogametech I loved de Blob, but but some reason I didnt find the second game as engaging, even though the controls were better and there were more things to do. I cant quite glean your overall opinion of platformers from this video but I think Wario Land: The Shake Dimension is one of the best. I also thought A Boy and his Blob was excellent, but that was probably equal parts good puzzle platforming and nostalgia.
retrogametech Nice pickups Martin u gotta get dead space
retrogametech Metal Slug Anthology is great. No More Heroes is fun, Mad World is great. Zak  Wiki is a good puzzler, Tatsunoko Vs Capcom is an amazing fighter, House Of the Dead Overkill is hilarious and brilliant.
retrogametech Zak and Wiki is a must buy for the Wii. Also Spectrobes: Origins is pretty good. House of the Dead: Overkill is funny as hell. And that is pretty much all the Wii I own.
retrogametech Normally this is where I would recomend okami but the hd remake on ps3 just blows it away...
retrogametech Need for Speed Nitro isnt the best game on the system, but worth it if you find it cheap.
retrogametech Thanks, dude. Already got it and thoroughly enjoyed it! Cheers :)
retrogametech Ive heard thats good. Will put it on the list. Cheers! :)
retrogametech Smash Bros. Brawl using a Gamecube controller is great fun.
retrogametech De Blob is a pretty decent game, just with a few dodgy controls :( I have the sequel on PS3 and would recommend it, especially at its relatively low price!
retrogametech If you are in racing, you should totally buy Trackmania Wii! Its one of the best arcade racers on Wii! :D
retrogametech A definite hidden gen is Mario Football, you could definately lose a few hours to that one! I would also obviously recommend Zelda Twlight Princess  Im not a massive fan of Zelda at all, but bloody hell is Twlight Princess a good game! Its starts a bit slow, but by the end youll be stunned and left breathless! The game seriously stands on its own two legs.
retrogametech That sound really interesting. Ill go watch some vids on it. Cheers!
retrogametech Cheers Seb! Yeah, seems nobody wants their Wii games anymore. Perfect time for thrifty games like me to pickup up some really good games on the cheap! Nintendo games have a habit of suddenly increasing in value. Thought Id give my collection a head start. :P
retrogametech Resident Evil games, Animal Crossing, Klonoa, Monster HUnter Tri, Tenchu: Shadow Asssassins  Sin and Punishment
retrogametech Is Fragile Dreams the one that scared you? haha. It looks cool. No More Heroes 2 and RedSteel 2 have been added to the list. :) I have one of the DLC bit.trip mini games installed on the system. I think its called Run? I kept falling at the same point everytime and nearly rage quit, haha. The compilation does look good though. Perfect match for the Wii controller. Yeah great time to build a nice little collection. So many weirdinteresting games to choose from and all very cheap.
retrogametech Tis quite nice, but since Ive got a R4 card for my DS I wont be needing one any time soon.Although, its interesting that it can play MP3s with, I assume, its built in sound chip.
retrogametech any chance to use this as a flash cart?
retrogametech Thats cool, didnt know this existed.
retrogametech I have one since just after launch. Cost me  14.99 back then
retrogametech Which HMV did you find this in Martin? Wouldnt mind trying this out myself.
retrogametech Ive had one of these for a long time and the box and everything, its pretty cool and especially the retro menus.
retrogametech I dont believe Ive ever heard of this accessory before, it must have come out very late in the life of the GBA, possibly 2005 or 2006. It wouldnt support SDHC cards because that standard wasnt really developed until late 2006some time in 2007. Interesting product, I know there were third party MP3 players for the GBA.
retrogametech Its definitely a quirky little addon. Thanks for watching!
retrogametech I wish i had a store near me that sold these types of gaming memorabilia!
retrogametech Is it pretty much an MP3 player that just borrows the GBA battery, controls and LCD for its UI? Also I never even knew my 3DS could play music, pretty cool!!
retrogametech 3:57 far cry 3 blood dragon soundtrack
retrogametech Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon! )
retrogametech I had no idea this existed... Thats strange. xD
retrogametech Well you know what I mean.
retrogametech Question: What is with the Moonshell folder on the SD card? Was that just left over from a flash cart, or does this thing actually use Moonshell? Surely I wouldnt think it would, but it wouldnt completely surprise me.
retrogametech Wow thats cool! I wonder if that was released in America
retrogametech Whats with the moonshell? Was you trying to see if other things would run? Or maybe just used an SD card from a backup cart you had music on already? Pretty cool though, wish I got one that cheap.
retrogametech Couldnt just leave it there at that price! :P
retrogametech Haha, thats a kinda neat addon.
retrogametech Best soundtrack ever! Power Glove are awesome.
retrogametech how is the sound quality?
retrogametech The SP has a proprietary headphone jack at the back of the console but the cart has a built in 3.5mm audio jack anyway.
retrogametech Yeah I think it used a compact flash card, he showed me it connected to his original model DS. Hed got one early, imported a Japanese DS. It must have made an impression, as I ordered a Japanese DS from a UK ebay seller a couple of weeks later. I ended up getting a DS lite later, but I traded that in against my 3DS and I still own my original chunky Japanese system :) Those were the good olf days when Nintendo were still releasing region free handhelds...
retrogametech Did you test it out on a DSDS Lite at all? Im curious as to how the layout changes when you switch from a GBA to a DS
retrogametech Could this be used as a flashcart?
retrogametech No, you dingus. This is photoshop.
retrogametech You didnt know the 3DS played music!? It has some pretty sweet 3D interactive visualizations to mess about with. Theres some really trippy stuff to mess around with while you listen. Its great :)
retrogametech Moonshl is just one of the folders on that SD card. Same card I use in my R4.
retrogametech Sweet little add on  they go for 1525 on eBay!
retrogametech I remember when it came out, that and the DS internet browser
retrogametech I love when shops are desperate to get rid of older hardware! :)
retrogametech Ive seen those on ebay. They use the big old flash memory cards if I recall?
retrogametech Funny enough I did mention to my friend about this when I was in. So instead of going home with some gaming goodies my son got his wish for Minecraft junk instead lol
retrogametech If nintendo made a decent phone out of the ds (With android) I would so buy it
retrogametech Very cool device! Cant complain specially with that price :)
retrogametech Looks better than Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix.
retrogametech Pretty awesome dude. Would love to get a hold of one of these. Its just pants that the nearest HMV these days is Glasgow or Edinburgh, and probably not likely to find one now
retrogametech I would of grabbed it for 98p, i have never heard of these before. Very random, but worth having.
retrogametech Great, very clear and louder than the GBAs default output. On par with any other modern MP3 player.
retrogametech Really glad to see you posting more videos! Missed seeing you in my feed! :)
retrogametech I remember wanting this with a Micro back in the day. Until the iPod Nano came out.
retrogametech The AES repair? Ill be doing a followup on that in the next couple of weeks :)
retrogametech It should do yes. I havent tested that though.
retrogametech Haaaa. Thats the Playyan. Never knew the released outside of Japan. Envious now...
retrogametech I wonder why they say it isnt compatible with the older GBA models. Thats strange. Cool video man!
retrogametech A great little novelty for 98p:)
retrogametech its a good find ive thrown more change away
retrogametech the cart itself has a headphone jack. he showed it in the video.
retrogametech That sounds cool! I havent seen one of those before.
retrogametech never seen this before.
retrogametech Cool piece of tech, maybe a bit pointless.
retrogametech That box has a similar desing to the webbrowser addon. I saw those when I was in France 4 years ago.
retrogametech No, I havent tested that yet. Id guess it just switches the DS into GBA mode and looks the same. Will test later though.
retrogametech Ive never even heard of it before, Im surprised Nintendo didnt promote it more in the day. BTW Martin, not seen you on any of my videos for ages, are you still subbed to me dude?
retrogametech I just used the card from my R4. )
retrogametech Not bad for 98p, eh? :)
retrogametech so they made an mp3 player for the gameboy sp which has no headphone jack
retrogametech Well worth 98p, I remember my friend used to have a third party one that could play videos etc.
retrogametech Can the 3ds play movies?
retrogametech Telecom Power Glove is the band
retrogametech nice1, didnt know this even existed! :)
retrogametech Hey man. I would like to see the part 2 of that neo geo video. Will you be doing one soon? Thanks man
retrogametech nice find boxed you will get 20. for that in five ten years i reckon
retrogametech Yeah the AES. awesome!!! thanks man
retrogametech I forgot that the 3DS could play music.
retrogametech I went back to check, and it was a different animal altogether when I took it out of the box. The thing was massive.
retrogametech You can find non sdhc cards about. I have some 4GB (fat16) ones. 4GB was the switch over to SDHC. Check out Amazon 5
retrogametech Was that one of the ones that also play videos? Sometimes they sell quite well on ebay.
retrogametech Its just the same SD card I use in my DS R4 )
retrogametech Reminds me of those dodgy Chinese media player carts that you could flash with an alternate firmware, and then run backup roms off the SD card. ... is that what the moonshl entry was?
retrogametech It was the only one and in the preowned tradein section so your best bet is maybe ebay or an indie game store. I dont think HMV themselves ever sold these. If they did it would have been many years ago.
retrogametech Awesome for 98p ! evan 2p left over from a pound !! i love a bargain ! :)
retrogametech Would it work with the Gamecubes GBA player?
retrogametech That looks awesome! Ive never seen anything like that over here in the US, though. Id buy one if they sold em in stores here...
retrogametech It was probably only released in limited numbers to get a feel for interest. It looks like a variant of the Playyan from Japan. Haha, an odd question, but ok. To be honest I dont think I ever was. I was subbed to your old channel I believe.
retrogametech HMV seem to be ditching all their video game stock at the moment so youre not missing out on much. They dont even have new released games these days.
retrogametech It would be cool if they made this for the original gameboy
retrogametech I didnt actually look that close, but Ill have to check the next time Im there.
retrogametech Way cool! I would permanently install rocket knight adventures on it! Best game, best music EVER!
retrogametech Whats the master system compatibility on this like? Have you tested any MS games on an everdrive as the real Megadrive had Master system hardware compatibility built in.
retrogametech Can you mod this to output RGB?
retrogametech it was maid in taiwan
retrogametech Andy crane...blast from the past
retrogametech I might make a portable (so original) GameCube. Using the classic folding screen top, and a laptop battery. Maybe even shorter cord lengths for the controllers. Probably never gonna do it, but its just an idea I had.
retrogametech Nice Video cover of the system, can you not use the audio out out on the MEGA CD ?
retrogametech SE93 is pin and function compatible VDP to original chip. SE94 is the IO and bus management chip, also pin and funciton compatible with real Sega chip found in later MD1 boards.The Oscillator is NTSC based which is why its not exactly the same.These superclones are total awesome !
retrogametech I like the music. specially the main riff beginning
retrogametech This was great. I remember some shady dudes selling the scorpion in Northampton shopping centre back in the day. And I never forgot it. Glad to hear its actually a good system. Thanks for the video, it was very informative and I loved all the tech stuff.
retrogametech I loved that shop. They had so many types of Micro Machines! Id have spend hours in there if Id been allowed, haha.
retrogametech That would be cool. Maybe he could answer some questions about the system. He might not know much about it, or even remember it at all, but who knows... he might be able to shed some light on things. In any case it never hurts to ask, and he would probably be happy to know his name turned up on a scrap of paper from 20 years ago. Let us know in a follow up video what he says. :)
retrogametech Sadly theres no details on what was done to achieve compatibility. Ive got mine partially compatible but I think I might need to switch out the Xtal or find a NTSC 32X.
retrogametech The worst thing you can do is play the Wing Fortress level of Sonic 2, its just so bad.
retrogametech It is ok somebody buying a Mega CD or a CDi today and saying how bad the systems are, you need to had had them on release to really under stand them and that they were good for their time and are still good for people who have the memories to go with them
retrogametech Its a weird one for sure. Ive now managed to get it running at 60Hz and built a RGB connector for it :) . Dare I say the video quality is slightly better than the Mega Drive!
retrogametech Magic2 means there was a Magic1 clone of the Sega Master System or just the first revision of the Genesis clone? This was very cool, Ive never seen this before.
retrogametech I think the controllers are just generic. Ive seen loads of them in the past. They are really bad! haha
retrogametech Theres a picture of a Colecovision on the RF switch
retrogametech Haha, yeah the sound on those AtGames clones can be a little wonky to say the least! There are lots of original Mega Drives on ebay very cheap these days though. Makes it a great console to collect for :)
retrogametech That RF switch is an original ColecoVision RFswitch... Odd
retrogametech Thanks for watching and taking the time to comment! :) I find the bootleg and clone systems interesting, too.
retrogametech I know your called RetroGameTech but are you going to be buying the android gaming console OUYA?
retrogametech There was a add on for it that lets you play Nintendo games can you find one?
retrogametech Love that show back in the day :)
retrogametech Yeah it would be nice to find one with the second slot.
retrogametech Supercool looking! Has a nice formshape. Thanks for the share :)
retrogametech Bloody hell I remember that haha
retrogametech Did you mean to say the Master System converter? If so I hadnt even thought of that! :P I dont own one but it would be cool to test. Id guess it would work.
retrogametech Also, hes on Twitter. He looks to be about the same sort of age to have been able to do the instructions 20 years ago, and he lives in Taiwan where this thing was probably manufactured... get this, he teaches English there, so he would have been perfect for the task of coming up with English instructions. twitter(dot)comTELtaiwan
retrogametech It crazy to think that it was even cheaper than the real deal!
retrogametech Ideally you need to get a scope and logic analyser onto the job and compare signals to working MD and 32x. Could be a noisy  different sync signal or something. Also possible timing difference somewhere else on the scorp  maybe that jumper on its own for 60hz isnt enough? Presumably youve tried 50hz with 32x? Great vids btw!
retrogametech Dangerous stuff!! Watch one episode and before you know it youre 2 seasons in and trapped in a YouTube vortex!! :P
retrogametech You have anything cool you been working on lately? if not... go build some shit.
retrogametech Thanks for watching! Yeah Bad Influence was great :)
retrogametech Haha, I doubt youd see anyone get away with that nowadays!
retrogametech Cool vid. Beatties was an awesome shop. Bought my first RC car (van) from there Lunchbox.
retrogametech Probably. Ive seen variants of this console posted in forums by US collectors.
retrogametech I think it looks kinda cool too! But thats just me :P
retrogametech The sega 32X compatibility fix with this clone has been done, can be seen here: vKbW2pN6mk
retrogametech Made in Taiwan!. All those Megadrive clones was made in Taiwan!!!!
retrogametech You can still watch it on YouTube :P And its weirdly even more enjoyable to watch now! haha
retrogametech i might be wrong, but i think that the reason it is locked to PAL is a feature of the console as many Tvs back in the 90s where not compatible with 60hz NTSC, the reason for the main oscillator on the board is that the chipset and cpu (68k), sound (z80) will have its own clock divided by the custom Chips, to be compatible with other regions the clock are changed but the final video output will stay at 50hz pal, very clever for a 90s clone, i wonder if the 32x can be made to work?

retrogametech also wonder if the jumper wire has anything to do with it being stuck in 50hz
retrogametech I doubt there really was a Magic 1. I think they were just trying to make it look more like a Model 2 Mega Drive by calling it a Magic 2 and using the same font :P.
retrogametech where can you buy one of these?
retrogametech how much cost one of these and where can we find one?
retrogametech I used to love bad infulence I also used to rush home from school I used to like the guy namrood who did the cheats lol stuck then on his head firtlers lol
retrogametech Wow, that was an amazing break down that machine. I seem to recall Scorpion being a name in the Clone machines from that time period. I recall seeing a black Famicom looking device earlier in the year, also bearing the name Scorpion.
retrogametech Damn, now I have another clone console I want... thanks a lot! lol
retrogametech Interesting clone system, and funny that the gaming show thought it was appropriate to advertise a clone system :)
retrogametech Youre no doubt correct. Ive since managed to switch the console back to 60Hz mode to remove the borders and slowdown :)
retrogametech Haha, no worries. Its definitely nice to see a higher quality bootleg for a change! :)
retrogametech Please use a mic... could barely understand you!
retrogametech Brings back memories of that Bad Influence episode all them years ago seeing this clone console. When I first started watching this video I was saying to myself I have seen this clone somewhere before and trying to think where before you had mentioned the Bad Influence episode they showed it on.
retrogametech I remember watching that episode of Bad Influence! At the time I couldnt understand why you would want to tear apart a cartridge!
retrogametech If you like 1:1 clones check out the gb boy colour console, its a gameboycolor system that plays exactly like a proper gameboy but with a proper lit up lcd screen. i did a review on one
retrogametech That is amazing! I cant believe you found one and gave us such an up close view of it!! I remember watching the episode and being fascinated by the machine when I was maybe 7 or 8!! It couldnt have found a better owner! I bet it has another 20 years in it!
retrogametech Ha! Im surprised youve not found one at a carboot by now! :P The Scorpion branded version seems uber rare. The thing with the extra cart slot is strange. If you look carefully, even the one shown on Bad Influence is missing the extra connector. Theres another Scorpion console review on YT and it doesnt even have the hatch at all. Andy Crane also tried to plug that review cart in the wrong end! :P Beatties was awesome as a kid! Mine had a running model railway suspended from the ceiling!
retrogametech What, no love for the bootleg, Luke? haha Youd strip it for parts? Do you know how long Ive been looking for one of these Scorpion clones :P Was the Mega Drive successful over in Japan? Or was it not that popular? Here in the UK theyre all over ebay and carboot sales. There are so many of them that you can pick one up for next to nothing. SNES on the other hand is the complete opposite.
retrogametech very cool piece of kit, especially for being region free, its probably locked to 50hz as not many pal TVs would have been capable of 60hz back then. so outputting 60hz wouldnt have been very useful at the time.
retrogametech where did you find that cool clone
retrogametech Without looking  cheating the on web, i think that was called Midnight Pumpkin. Certainly good timescarefree.I used to race my pal who had a Grasshopper (i think it was called).Mine wast good around cornershis was! : Keep up the good work on the vids, its all good stuff.
retrogametech I remember that episode of bad influence that and games master witch was my favourite gaming show.
retrogametech As always thanks for watching :)
retrogametech Cool video! My genesis model 1 has cxa1145p video encoder so you should get rgb. However I wouldnt suggest it because when I modded mine for s video it had lined artifacts that wouldnt go away. When I modded my model 2 with a Fujitsu encoder the lines werent there.
retrogametech I certainly hope Sega hired the guys who bootlegged this.
retrogametech i remember watching that on bad influence, I thought it was neat and wanted one never did manage to find one back in the day
retrogametech Shame they only fitted 2 mod switches. What you have there is region lock and language, I have a clone called Mega Drive X that has 3 switches. Region, language and 5060Hz.
retrogametech I measured the points with a multimeter and they were all the same so I dont know. Ill have to take a closer look at it this week.
retrogametech Very likely the same guy. All the other bits included with the console are marked as manufactured in Taiwan. He probably workedworks as a translator and proofreader as well. Maybe Ill drop him a PM to see if he remembers.
retrogametech That thing is rather cool looking. Great video!
retrogametech Whats the story with that tiny Japanese Batman Mega Drive case? Ive never seen those before.
retrogametech Add me as a contact, i cant send you a message :(
retrogametech Nice video. Ive wanted one of these for years. (Yes, Bad Influence). But Im generally obsessed with clones and knock offs. Must have about 20 Famiclones alone.
retrogametech Still got mine and it still works fine (though using a replacement PSU). (Mines a Scorpion XVI by the way)
retrogametech I see Megamix at the start. Nice!
retrogametech The problem I had with sound just happened when I played that game all my another games worked perfectly
retrogametech Hey I think the problem with sound is the game try another game cos I had the same problem with the sound and a mate ungraded the sound chip on my neogeo and had no problems with it since.
retrogametech I would buy one off u if you where able to give us a price iv been looking all over eBay for a project and I cant find any
retrogametech Wow. Thats got to be the deal of the decade. You almost never see NeoGeo AESs on ebay or heck, anywhere. Awesome stuff, and I hope you fixed them. :)
retrogametech harry,the lcd screen is for the modchip thats in the xbox,its a optional purchase when you buy the chip
retrogametech I was bidding on that aswell lol
retrogametech Once theyre fully reworked and cleaned up theyll definitely be worth a little more than what I paid for them, thats for sure! :P
retrogametech Love these videos mate, my favourite YouTube channel by a mile. Please keep them coming.
retrogametech I was hell bent on bidding on this and bloody missed it!! However now I know you got it, it eases the pain!! Im just realy glad no spotty little scrote with a butane soldering iron and a burning desire to fix the world got hold of it!
retrogametech This is the best bargain i have seen!! Well done mate. I think the unibios chips are different for the MVS, depending on the motherboard they just plug straight in (socket type) and i dont think you need to solder wires?? Or am i wrong
retrogametech But I dont have those parts. Those are some of the bits I need! :P
retrogametech This is awesome. How much do you think you can get for them?
retrogametech Cheers! :) The prices for some AES games is obscene! Very cool console but prohibitively expensive :( MVS FTW! :)
retrogametech Cant be having that! :P
retrogametech Bloomin great pick up, you lucky bugger! o)
retrogametech How ridiculous was that?! What an amazing bargain, youll make a pretty penny out of those, I kind of ignored my AES after picking up most of the cheap games, MVS is so much more convenient :) As always, an impressive video of your skills :D
retrogametech Hey mate ever find a cheap one pm me i would like to get one of these.
retrogametech Those are definitely the best types of deal. You can sometimes just tell from someones auction listing that they either dont care or have no idea how to properly test something :P This occasion was just a very nice surprise. I thought I was only buying faulty parts boards! XD
retrogametech Haha yes, it looks like I might have try and fashion an alternative.
retrogametech Nice Video!!! Greetings from Germany!
retrogametech thats fuckin terrible about the broken box. and its got fragile stickers on and everything! man, they put their prices up, take the piss, then treat packages like shit.. GRRRR!! dude, you are a tech legend. what a result.
retrogametech Hey Martin, I always enjoy your vids about more exotic (at least here in europe) consoles. What happened to your TurboGrafx? Even a short vid about your experience with it and your opinion would be really appreciated!
retrogametech Hope you made a recent markup on them?
retrogametech Lol noticed your name right away haha
retrogametech I just got lucky... again :P. On closer inspection that UniBios console will actually need a fair amount of reworking to put 100 right. But the other console with the bad PSU just needs one component replaced! :) Do you know exactly whats wrong with yours? Does it turn on at all?
retrogametech hey martin i am trying to message you but it wont let me as you need to have me as a contact apparently now. i have added you to my address book. cheers
retrogametech You need to be checking ebay multiple times a day to find the good stuff )
retrogametech Yup, but its not the greatest, 2mbps only, but for now at least its good enough to what the youtubers I like, will do a update video soon though :)
retrogametech haaaaaaaaaaa hell naw your on my ps3 friends list bro
retrogametech super jelous. but very happy for tyou!
retrogametech Thanks dude. Pretty happy with the outcome :)
retrogametech As usual, you managed to bag yourself a bargain!
retrogametech The monkeys at royal mail did a good job with that box!
retrogametech Thanks. Just luck :P. I still need to put a few hours work into each console to get them 100. Otherwise Im pretty happy :)
retrogametech What a bargain! 2 almost (and now fully) working AES for that price is awesome!
retrogametech Can anyone please tell me why there seems to be an LCD display built in to the front of his Xbox?
retrogametech Great price and great ending. As Hannibal Smith used to say I love it when a plan comes together!!
retrogametech thanks. lets give it a try then. now the only problem is finding a connector then.
retrogametech lol, yes i would. let me know when you want got get rid of them and the price you want. would love to take one of these bad boys of ya hands.
retrogametech tried to PM and failed. Hi I just want to ask you something technical... I have got an extra NES console... And I want to convert it to a famicom. I disabled the NEs10 chip. Other than soldering a 60 pin connector to main board, do I need to do any thing else? Because I have seen some converters from old NES carts and they all have a chip on it. And I dont know if a direct solderin would work?

retrogametech Not sure. But once theyre fully functional again they should be worth a lot more than what I paid. Theyll be a bare bones unitreplacement board.
retrogametech Nice buys there, I was going to ask, if you would consider selling the big on button and the slider (I found an AES at a car boot sales a few years ago, it was in pieces but as I found out it worked but was missing the two switches), no problem if you want to keep them, I also have a few ngage goodies I could trade if you prefer. Anyway, keep up the good work.
retrogametech I have a long video I can give you the link to about it if you are interested.
retrogametech Hi, Recently i picked up used GBA console. Unfortunately when I turn it on screen is black with white GAME BOY text insted of white background and dark letters, sadly games are also in inverted, negative colors. Tried to strip down console and check ribbon cable, but it seems ok, adjusting potentiometer didnt work either. Any ideas what could be broken?
retrogametech I went to the pawn shops today, all offered 10 with controller and cables. They sell them for 60 : so Ill sell them on eBay Ill still come out on top anyway since I paid 23 for both :) Then after that if I cant sell both, I have some parts machines, so no biggie. Im not on many sites actually, is XS  XtremeSystems? If so Ive never been a member there.
retrogametech excellent vid, subscribed! miss my neo geo
retrogametech love watching your videos  your such a thrithy bastard lol
retrogametech Can you teach how these things?
retrogametech Gyromites in PAL region doesnt have that converter.
retrogametech Well Id hope youd be willing to pay a bit more than just the postage! haha :P
retrogametech Wow man. Nice surprise video.
retrogametech Very well done mate, you have done it again!!
retrogametech u lucky bastard :D. Ive always wanted a Neo Geo, but they still go for a decent price
retrogametech Very well done, hope the profit on them helps you with other projects, or something boring like bills )
retrogametech Sorry, recently Ive been getting loads of people PMing me with technical queries looking for help. As a result I sadly had to disable PMs altogether on my account. Therere literally not enough hours in the day for me to sit down, read, work out a solution then write out a detailed response to everyones questions. I tried to in the past but many people were either outright rude to me or didnt even say thanks. Its nothing personal. Keeping up with video comments is hard enough! :P
retrogametech The noise is make by the fan. Disconnect it is not an option, an ATX power supply is powerful an needs to be cooled. You can find an official Nintendo Wii AC adapter for less than 25 euro easily (try Play  Asia) )
retrogametech Neo Geo best fighting game console ever!
retrogametech Will you be buying Ouya?
retrogametech Great job, man! Its always good to know that another original SNK beast was saved from the death!
retrogametech Awesome fix, Martin! I might be able to buy one of those consoles off of you.
retrogametech Thanks, dude! They still need a bit of work but still a good deal. I see you have internet again? :)
retrogametech That was a nice surprise. Will there be a repair video for the other AES?
retrogametech I thought the same :P . I really only bought them for the parts and that UniBios chip to put in my MVS. I was surprised it went for such a low bid. Even more surprised the consoles arent completely dead! :P Win some lose some I guess :)
retrogametech I see the post is everywhere the same.
retrogametech Have you check the cable? If the cable is ok you have to check for leaking capacitor in the sound area of the mainboard.
retrogametech Wow, excellent work. What a deal! You could easily make like 150 quid if you resold them, right? Looking forward to your update video.
retrogametech Im going to try a similar set up, Wii component  VGA scaler  scan line generator  a VGA to HDMI converter because my new tv doesnt have a VGA input. Still waiting for it all to arrive but Im curious to see the results with my own eyes.
retrogametech Is there anything I could use in place of the VGA scaler for a Good antialiasing effect? Like a HDMI transcoder or something?
retrogametech Why do you have the scan lines
retrogametech The problem I have with the whole scanline thing is they seem to always make the picture darker than it should be no matter what I put the intensity on.
retrogametech Amazing job. Gonna copycat this.
retrogametech I think scan lines have an unexplainable charm to them. I guess its the retro look, I dont know, but they make everything look better in my eyes lol.
retrogametech The wires are a lot tidier than mine.
retrogametech Awesome setup homie,all you need is to paint the broom stick handle the same as the other legs,na its just this my ocd,by the way did you know that wayforward is remastering the nes ducktales...
retrogametech The GBA emulator on the Wii is pretty impressive! You probably enjoy messing around with that.
retrogametech I totally get what youre saying and on paper what Im doing with the Wii in this setup technically doesnt make sense. But in practice, and more so to the naked eye, the perceived image is greatly improved. Ive personally always found the Wiis video output particularly fuzzy, washed out and poor quality in comparison to other consoles. For whatever reason the scaler and SLG just seem to have an anti aliasing effect which overall I really like. Its not perfect but its a good improvement :)
retrogametech I dont understand if you have the same option setup any chance of doing a small video to help me as yours might be a different option set up to mine then i can follow your video step by step then i will reply if i see anything different in my options compared to yours.
retrogametech Where did you get these? Ebay?
retrogametech Router right next to the heater?
retrogametech The clean and uniform presentation of your setup makes my eyes tingle with delight. Also the consoles all being black is really cool.
retrogametech Who says you cant? :P
retrogametech I wish our TVs had SCART inputs :( 2:07
retrogametech Humans are naturally curious. If we can learn something from it we generally enjoy it, a lot. :)
retrogametech Ah, that makes sense. Thanks for your response! :)
retrogametech I have one of those Wii HDMI things you stick up the Wiis butt, and it works pretty well. I only really have issues playing NES virtual console titles on it. My Metal Gear Solid: TTS LP was recorded with it.
retrogametech Why tell me to fuck off I meant!
retrogametech I really need to pick up some component cables for my Wii, Ive made use of composite as Ive really not played it all that much over the last few years. But I imagine something like Wind Waker would look amazing through component, especially in comparison to the woeful composite... And theres really no excuse, considering how cheap the cables are. Its not like trying to source Gamecube component cables O0
retrogametech Haha, Ive felt the same about the system for a while. The image quality always put me off. Totally love the console now, though. Games are dirt cheap and its extremely easy to softmod :)
retrogametech I love this behind the TV episode! Maybe its a quirk of retrogamers. Keep them coming!
retrogametech ArcadeForge for the SLG and ebay for the scaler. What system to collect for is really down to what you enjoy playing. Theres not much point in buyingcollecting stuff simply for the sake of it. Personally Id just buy the games that interest you. Softmodding a Wii allows you to run homebrew, emulators and play your games from an external HDD without needing the disc.
retrogametech As far as Emulation is there a big difference between the SLG and the emulation scan line filter?
retrogametech Most Wii games are optimised for 4:3. And overall the console just looks better in that ratio.
retrogametech Hey Martin, very nice cable management. Not messy at all. Also, lov da Outrun passing Breeze track playn n bkround
retrogametech play an older console that wasnt meant for HDTVs , on your HDTV and you will see. IMO, games that werent made for hdtvs, look like complete crap on hdtvs, so a lot of people will buy the older tvs to play them on, or you can get one of these scan line generators and get the same effect, and not have to have 2 tvs.
retrogametech As your TV has LAN input the secret door might be the door to the Tron World! Or simply CR2032 battery backup for the clock?
retrogametech Haha, and that wasnt a slip of the tongue. Ive always called it either Xbox 1 or teh original Xbox. What were Microsoft thinking when they came up with that stupid new name. What a great way to confuse customers.
retrogametech Well tell me too fuck off? Only asked a question... I was hoping he would reply not you...I have seen a lot of his videos but obviously not that one.. Chill out mate!
retrogametech I got a headache just from see ing the mess of wires you got there. Must have been a lot of trouble organizing all that nice job man
retrogametech 480p is Standard Res and 240p is Low res. 720p is Hi res 1080p is Hi Definition 2k is Hidefinition 4k is UHD 8k is UHD. Shhhh...
retrogametech Very brave moving that unit!! Cable hell. Tried this set up mate, tho it was ok, Ive since brought a crt tv for my wii. Far better results for me and cheaper than all scalers etc.
retrogametech arff i just realized even your avatar has scanlines
retrogametech I wish you would ome around my house and sort my cabling out, its a nightmare
retrogametech No idea why but I always prefer playing GBA games on the Gameboy Player vs anything else.
retrogametech Your setup is so perfectly put together. I plan on using a similar model when I move in a bit to get my wires under control and properly tied off. :)
retrogametech Thanks. I think stuff like this is pretty niche. I doubt many people want to listen to me talk about whats behind my TV :P
retrogametech Not sure about GC titles but mine is softmodded and plays games Wii games from any region (from an external HDD).
retrogametech tried that already thats why i trying to get ahold of him
retrogametech What was that game in the Dreamcast? I wonder if its something I would be interested in. Anyway, this was a cool little home project. I hope to do something like this myself when I finally have my own place.
retrogametech I dont really plan my vids, just make them as I feel like it :). You should totally do a tour! Its always cool to see other peoples setups. Thanks for taking the time to watch and comment :)
retrogametech I dont really plan my vids, just make them as I feel like it :). You should totally do a tour! Its always cool to see other peoples setups. Thanks for taking the time to watch and comment :)
retrogametech Really love watching your videos, plus this kind of made an updated entertainment setup tour of sorts! great cable management, I need to sort my cables out, theyre hidden well enough. Do you have any planned fix it videos in the works? Also are you still accepting room tours on your last video? I recently got my roomsetup into a condition Im content with. Wouldnt mind sharing it with you, seeing what you thought of it. Thanks for all the videos again btw, always entertaininginteresting.
retrogametech Why do you prefer a 4:3 aspect ratio over a 16:9 ratio?
retrogametech he must have explained himself in all of his videos talking about scan lines... fuck off and look for yourself.
retrogametech I think its probably one of the best :)
retrogametech Aw yeah Passing Breeze Euromix
retrogametech I dont use an SLG in the box but I guess the hardware here is near enough identical. I believe the manufacturers state theres something like a 1ms display lag when running the signal through this scaler. Not enough to be noticeable and personally I cant detect any difference between running it with or without.
retrogametech DoA 2 Japanese limited edition :). Awesome game!
retrogametech That 60Hz must be wonderful to have! I could never stand playing things in 50Hz.
retrogametech I designed it so it can be moved very easily as one complete unit. All the cabling is either bolted, screwed or fastened directly to the unit and cannot be moved or fall off. All I need to do is disconnectremove the TV and systems. All the wires and PSUs stay exactly where they are. I place the consoles in storage crates then secure the entire entertainment unit in wrapping film. Whole process takes about 20min max. Ive done it a few times now while redecorating. Huzzah! :)
retrogametech Great video as always, although (personally) I generally have an issue with adding scanline emulation to a game that was actually meant (originally coded and designed) for either a 480i (fake hires) or 480p (hires). Scanline emulation should be really left for 240p original content, that has been transferred to a 480ip encode. Saying all of though...... it can look rather pleasant when overlaying a progressive image, especially from a console with duboius quality output like the Wii. :D
retrogametech It makes a massive improvement to older systems on LCD Tvs. Check out a YouTuber called faginrs500. He has detailed vids on the subject with examples.
retrogametech Theres no point in putting the Dreamcast through the scaler. It outputs a very nice 480p VGA signal natively so putting it through extra hardware would just end up degrading the image.
retrogametech It gives better detail in older games. On HDTV 16 bit games look really blocky and colors blend together. With scan lines it gives better separation to make them look really sharp.
retrogametech When I get into A more permanent location Id like to have A setup like that. Also makes me wanna get one of those for my Gamecube games  I wanna see what it would look like on the GameBoy Player And Shiren The Wanderer.
retrogametech Can you not put the Dreamcast VGA into the gonbes 8220 scalers input? Or does it only accept CGA resolutions there?
retrogametech On the original Wii, its easy, you just install the Homebrew Channel(If you do it right, and dont install BootMii(Which bricks your Wii), it has no drawbacks, but adds a bunch of positives). On the Wii U, Im not sure if there is any way to install any Homebrew yet. Im sure a way will be found eventually, though(If there isnt already). :)
retrogametech whats usb media box do you use and would you recommend it
retrogametech Amazing! Truly an inspiration for my and my plans to resurrect my gaming room. Thanks for the great post!
retrogametech Hey, I wanted to ask you what can I do to use my consoles with a VGA monitor. Maybe via component or SCART.
retrogametech Definitely get yourself a set of component cables for the Wii. Dirt cheap and totally worth it :) . And yeah, its a very nice way to get around the GameCubes expensive and rare cables :)
retrogametech Just the confusion that will now ensue most of the time nowadays lolol
retrogametech no warranty, ms i loathe ms custmer support and i dont wanna pay over 100 to fix it
retrogametech beautiful, isnt it? :P
retrogametech Yep had it since 2005 :P
retrogametech Why are the scan lines good?
retrogametech I love that Outrun Remix. What is it called?
retrogametech Why dont you have the Wii in 16:9?
retrogametech Thanks. Im never quite satisfied with it though. Theres always something else that could be streamlinedimproved :P
retrogametech OMG! Hes got a Xbox ONE! )
retrogametech No, the only systems in my setup that benefit from that particular scaler and SLG are the Wii and Dreamcast. The rest I prefer TO directly hookup via RGB SCART :) . Maybe if I had something like an XRGBMini but I doubt Id invest that much money into one piece of hardware :P
retrogametech Ah. I see. Also, how do you hook up so many systems without causing electrical hazards? And why do you use those SCART switchers?
retrogametech your set up makes me want to touch myself in forbidden places.. like area 52..
retrogametech Do what you gotta do, buddy. We wont judge you :P
retrogametech How do you get a sega genesis emulator on the wii u?
retrogametech could you fix my 360 for me? it red ring on me and i dont wanna deal with ms again
retrogametech U have more games than me
retrogametech Nice :) I need to get an SLG. How well does the cheapy scaler work when it actually scales the image up to 720p? In essence you are just using it as a pass through to the slg3000 right?
retrogametech I think a lot of Wii and GC games were originally coded for that ratio. 16:9 is just a bit much for something like the Wii to handle well. 4:3 looks much better IMO.
retrogametech What is the television stand you have?
retrogametech Wii has some of the best games Ive ever played (DKCR being my favourite). Such a great system.
retrogametech How much was the MV1C? You can buy good used ones for about US120150.
retrogametech This Video is currently unavailable if live in North Wales! I live 250 miles away from fucking Glasgow my farts are audible further than that fucking distance why is youtube unable to make a video available for that distance!
retrogametech Great deal on the 360 and the controllers, if the nephews get bored of ODST you could picked them up a copy of Crackdown andor Crackdown 2. Great games to play coop.
retrogametech Liking the scan lines! Looks great on 2D games, how does it look for 3D ones? Kind of interested in this now.
retrogametech i flashed my wii to get the black menu.
retrogametech Thanks. Couldnt believe it when I got the confirmation email on the controllers. I thought it was a mistake :P
retrogametech Ah I understand the scan lines now! They make it look like a crt tv right?
retrogametech Haha, Im done with the challenges for now :P . Not too familiar with old Ataris so not sure what to suggest.
retrogametech Got to love the WII lightgun games.
retrogametech game was closing in a shopping center next to me . My friend got about 20 ds games 1 2 pounds each .i missed out :C as i went the next day and it was fully closed
retrogametech Not really but it still looked interesting and my Wii collection is small. 3 games I think.
retrogametech Can I ask, where do you get those brackets you use to mount things under the desk? Been hunting for these from BQ as they would be ideal for me to mount things under shelfs etc but they dont seem to have those long ones you have??? Cheers
retrogametech Thanks, I appreciate the nice feedback! There are plenty of other YouTubers with content well worth a watch. Got a few listed on my main page channels list :)
retrogametech The 360 and controllers were a steal. Great job.
retrogametech I still need to complete 12! :P
retrogametech I always find it so hard to find good deals of faulty consoles online any tips?
retrogametech If I had to guess he probably likes putting things together, he seems handy with tools.
retrogametech I like how you store your game boy color games. I have started a collection of the GB cartridges and I got some good deals from uk online store gamerascal. Check out my video if you wish.
retrogametech Id love to do some vids on the weird games Ive found for the system :) . A GBA CIB collection? youve got balls! haha.
retrogametech can you send me a link on the scaler and scan line generator?
retrogametech Get a cheap scaler off ebay and plug in a SLG. Its like a completely different console! :)
retrogametech Three things mate: (If you dont mind!) 1. What is the difference of PAL cases? Never noticed! 2. If you still have a love for GBA  Micros, check out Rose Colored Gaming (Best to google it.) They do faceplates, which you might like. 3. Fantastic videos as always, and great finds! :) Seth
retrogametech Yes, I did one a while back about fitting battery holders in GBC carts :)
retrogametech Thanks. I remember hearing talk of a 3rd party circle pad pro that had a built in battery for extending the playtime of the console. Not sure if that ever got made though.
retrogametech See you got seamamm for dreamcast heard so much about it never seen anyone play it though is it good?
retrogametech Nice stuff man, love the Kasumi statue, I have the same one next to me right now haha. Since youre a massive DOA fan like myself, are you interested in a Kasumi Blue XBOX? I can help get one for you :)  That iPhone cover I believe was a prize Team Ninja were giving away so amazing score on that! Look forward to your upcoming videos man.
retrogametech great video! dead or alive has to be the only series of fighting games i cant get into : ive been trying to play it on the vita but i just cant figure it out for some reason, maybe its because im so used to capcom fighters like umvc3, and the main 3D game i play is tekken. i might get doa5 on the ps3 so i can play on my stick and maybe thatll help but its kinda hard to get used to the counter system...you should do a beginners guide video!
retrogametech Sure, Ill show them when I get round to doing my GBAGBC vids :)
retrogametech You always seems to get lucky on eBay pickups! some mega cheap stuff there.
retrogametech Ah well nice to know :) I have been a fan of your videos for a while now. First one I saw was a couple of years ago on the wiring on your jtag. Keep up the good work :P
retrogametech Looks great on everything I tried :) Even 3D onrails shooters look much better!
retrogametech halo ODST was the first halo game to give me a headache while playing it. Every Halo after the original halo 3 gives me a headache when playing through the campaign. dont know weather its just me or not.(probably is). but from memory halo ODST is a good halo to get, the campaign is responsibly good (confusing at times, ie the snipe on the power lines takes a while to figure out where it is) and the multiplayer comes with all the DLC maps for halo 3 and it also has the firefight mode.
retrogametech Excellent video thanks for sharing! Have you had any problems with your PS3? Ive been told at GameStop that those older, bigger models are more likely to have issues then the newer, slimmer PS3s. But, they are cheaper, so Ive thought about getting one.
retrogametech haha just when i have nothing to watch the best tech man brings out a video woop some nice pickups there and my god the wii looks epic when you get chance play madworld its only a 6 hour game but my god is it fun! :)
retrogametech Soft mod and firmware hack :)
retrogametech gameboy multicarts! I wantz :(
retrogametech That wasnt WWF Mayhem it was WCW mayhem
retrogametech Not yet but when the next gen of consoles comes I probably will be :)
retrogametech PS4 ,,,,or,,,, Xbox one?
retrogametech we have the same tv stand
retrogametech I do enjoy this style of video! Cant beat a good waffle.
retrogametech Thanks for watching :)
retrogametech we have the same tv stand
retrogametech I do enjoy this style of video! Cant beat a good waffle.
retrogametech with what are you recording?
retrogametech Thanks for watching :)
retrogametech I really like how only Batmans cape is moving on that title screen.
retrogametech Its an HDDVD player. Its an old format used to store movies in high definition. Years ago there was a struggle between HDDVDVideo and BDVideo format for conquest the new HD home video market. Sony won the battle mainly thanks to the PlayStation 3 and its integrated Blu Ray Disc drive, and Toshiba, Microsoft and the others companies on the HDDVD side stopped the production and switch to BD.
retrogametech ahh i loved world of goo. very good ending.
retrogametech The reason the Wii benefits (or any system really)  scan lines are anti aliasing for the brain ). Did a bit about that in my Dreamcast tear down vid. Keep up the great work )
retrogametech Keep up the great work. Love the vids
retrogametech Lol you love the scan lines dude
retrogametech Scanlines make the Wii look better cause it breaks up the horrible lack of antialiasing. Im guessing it would make the xbox look better too if Im honest.
retrogametech We all love your videos dude ! we can all send martin some red bull to give you energy to keep them up ! great pick ups love the wii shooters too ! your right now is a great time for some wii bargains !! pick up epic mickey despite a few flaws its a great platformer ! )
retrogametech Complete your first Neo Geo and keep the other one boxed up as a replacement
retrogametech No, the menu on all Wiis is white by default. I modded mine when I got it a few years back :) . From what I remember its really easy to do. Theres a file you download and install which switches the colour for you.
retrogametech Hi Martin, great vid as always. Quick question. What are the model numbers of the component to vga scaler and the scan line generator so I can buy one? I have a scaler made by Mayflash but the output is crap.
retrogametech It works surprisingly well with the Wii. You should definitely check it out. :) DIY scanline generator?, sounds cool! What tut did you follow?
retrogametech Haha, thanks. Glad you like this type of vid. Some people hate when a video lasts for more than 10 minutes :P
retrogametech That is a lot if consoles
retrogametech Its what it does best IMO :) . It great to still be able to play stuff like HOTD even though I no longer have a CRT set up. Have you ever played Dead Space Extraction? Its probably my favourite onrails shooter ever :)
retrogametech Thanks for the suggestion. Ill keep a look out for a copy. I was playing some ODST myself the other day. Id forgotten how many Firefly cast and references are in that game! :)
retrogametech you should try and find Metroid Prime Trilogy, you should be able to get it for 10 to 20 pounds, its 3 games in one and if you NEVER played the first 2, its the bast way to play
retrogametech so its just an xbox branded hd dvd player. Or is it have the hardware to play xbox games as well. Since xbox games are on hd dvd, correct?
retrogametech Thanks. Haha, its a cool little game, you should check it out :)
retrogametech Id love to see a DOA collection video, as well as GBA and Ngage stuff. I totally get the lack of motivation thing. You can try getting around it by arguing with yourself and hopefully wind up convincing yourself to make a video :P.
retrogametech Reasons why I play the Wii on a CRT :D. I just bought a Wii. A lot of Cheap games. Picked up Zelda: Skyward sword for 19AU, metroid for 15AU and a couple of others for 4AU
retrogametech Please read the message i sent you retrogametech please .
retrogametech Id love to see a video of you going over all the flash carts you have. I find them just so intresting.
retrogametech Hey Ive got a challenge for you! Ive got an xbox, I brought it off of a guy with the description flashed in brilliant condition It has e74 and Everything has been tried to recover it. I will send this to you and I want to see if you can repair it! The guy I brought it from has tried everything...
retrogametech I actually tried it with the Xbox and it didnt look very good at all. The original Xbox looks nice in 720p using the component cables anyway. But the Wii for whatever reason looks bad hooking it up directly using either component or RGB SCART. Running it at 480p in 4:3 ratio through the scaler and SLG make a big difference :)
retrogametech Totally addicted to your videos Martin, had a look around for more channels like this but cant seem to find any with quite the same quality. Keep up the good work mate )
retrogametech Those controllers arent Datel controllers, are they? Unless you got a WildfireTurbofire Evo, they may break soon. Judging from watching for about 5 secs and looking at a thumbnail, I may be wrong and if so just ignore me.
retrogametech make the old mvs in the wood case and use the new mvs some times
retrogametech Can you do a video showing everything you have faming related
retrogametech DS cases? DS PAL cases are white plastic, much thicker, have no spine art and normally just plain title text. Theyre very bland looking. Thanks for the tip and thanks for watching :)
retrogametech is that a led mod in the wii sensor bar or does it help with how well it reads the wiimote?
retrogametech Love the scanlines :) You should install Wiiflow on your wii then you can just load all your games on a USB hard drive and play them without discs.
retrogametech Thats funny because its one of the only fighting games I can actually get into :P . DOA and Breakers on the MVS are about the only ones Im any good at. I dont know what to suggest. Ive always just found DOA very intuitive, fun and easy to play. Other popular fighters generally seem complicated and too technical for my tastes. Overall Im not all that great with the genre. I just play for fun :)
retrogametech Retro, are you a PC Gamer as well?
retrogametech have you done a video replacing the battery on a gameboy cart?
retrogametech Thanks. Anytime I pull my MVS boards out to work on I just end up playing them. Nothing ever gets done! :P
retrogametech Hey Great video! I was wondering if you knew how to make the 3DS battery last longer that what it usually does
retrogametech Damn, i wished i had such an Ability to repair broken stuff like you..
retrogametech Your a very clever man and I respect that. Good job.
retrogametech Make more videos of fixing defected consoles. Its just fun and interesting to watch.
retrogametech Passion to revive console games. nice!
retrogametech Would I be able to send you my genisis and see if you could fix it?
retrogametech You Sir, are the fricken Ganesh of console repair!!
retrogametech wow well done wish was gifted at repairs like you man
retrogametech Great effort you made, great job!
retrogametech Wow man, absolutely wonderful!
retrogametech Whats going on martin. Hope your ik not seen any vids for a while. Hopefully your ok mate.
retrogametech So good to see, that theese good old consoles are getting this good treatment. I doubt, somebody in 20 years or so, will be fixing Xbox or PS3 as efficiently, as this.
retrogametech Haha, well if I hadnt been under challenge conditions with my reputation on the line.... :P
retrogametech wow, that shows amazing dedication and patience! nice job.
retrogametech Would not know where to start lol maybe we can pm and see if u have time to help me out. Thank u
retrogametech This was just a bit of a one off, sorry. I dont normally do repairs on other peoples hardware. Im also not too familiar with the Famicom so probably wouldnt be much help to you :P
retrogametech Not only is it awesome that youre able to fix these but youre showing other people its possible to save some of these so dont throw them away so hastily!
retrogametech great job saving the mega drive man, was a good watch! )
retrogametech WHOA !! DUDE !! You are amazing ! Great job !
retrogametech Thats some good work. Fair play. Always good to watch.
retrogametech skills mandid you learn circuitry etc at college?...
retrogametech Wow great job, enjoyed watching it
retrogametech Awesome repair mate, another old classic get resurrected from the console graveyard.
retrogametech Thanks. It probably looked worse than it was. Luckily the traces and components on a MD mobo are pretty big and easy to work with :)
retrogametech Its on its way back to you right now :)
retrogametech After the nuclear fallout there the world will be populated by cockroaches and Mega Drives
retrogametech Siik vid as always :)
retrogametech EPIC rescue Martin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
retrogametech I havent had the time to check out the Super Cobra board yet, but I did try to degauss the monitor with an electric drill. It helped with the picture, but was not totally successful. I gave my MAME PC to a friend after his computer died, so that is on hold until he can afford to replace it.
retrogametech I sent you a personal message retrogametech pls read it. Thanks
retrogametech Haha, I have no idea but at least its fixed :)
retrogametech You are amazing!! Its so damn good to know there are people out there that can keep these old systems from dying out. Greetings from all the way over here in California.
retrogametech Brilliant fix mate..... Hummmmm let me have a look through my bits of stuff to send to you to fix lol. I gotta Pc Engine that have been badly RGB modded if your up for it
retrogametech unbelievable patience and skill! does anyone know where I can get a game gear fixed? there used to be an ebay ad for fixing them but it doesnt exist anymore. any help would be appreciated! I know nothing about them or how to do the type of work retrogametech does.
retrogametech I think it shows how determined he was in fixing it more than how resilient the console was. :p
retrogametech Talented fella ! .. Love your vids.
retrogametech You should do more of these videos.
retrogametech Good lord get the funk on with that BG music!
retrogametech jesus that conversion mod hackjob looked nasty! ive never seen a solder point that bad, even when i started out and thats sad lol
retrogametech Astounding work, well done !!
retrogametech Astounding work, well done !!
retrogametech Haha, when I turned the board over for the first time and saw all the damage I did consider emailing Daz to say it was dead :P
retrogametech Your like a console doctor mate well impressed I have a dreamcast that is a tad messed up been trying to get it going for a while managed to get it to run for about 15 mins at a time and it conks out. Respect to a fellow scotsman lol
retrogametech Same here bro, i moved from uk to morrinsville, nz, a couple years back and the market is non existent here. Where I use to live I was 10 minutes away from two shops which specialised in nother but retro games. eBay and trademe are my options now. When i can i also look for car boot sales in the hope theres some things there aswell.
retrogametech they dont have a word for craftsmanship, do they?
retrogametech Amazing work! Are you an experienced electrician or some sort? How did you learn to fix and mod items?
retrogametech I have a Marshall Amp that has a bad PCB like this, thanks for the tips. Hopefully I can repair it )
retrogametech Haha, not quite, but thanks! :)
retrogametech I was watching some random videos, stumbled upon your channel, and 3 hours later, still loving them. What I wanted to ask, was that, Im newly out of high school, love video games, but also wanted to get into the dirty side, the repairs as you do in some of your recent videos. What exact college courses would they be under, and info and help would be greatly appreciated, keep up the good work!!
retrogametech 6:03 SWEET JESUS THROW IT AWAY 9:55 very nice :) another blow against entropy :P
retrogametech its both. the sound doesnt work at all the and screen comes on but its really weird looking. I actually have a blue one and a black one. if someone could get just one of them working i would give the other in trade and pay for the parts and shipping. do you know someone? i recently tried my luck with a soldering iron and destroyed my headphones. i really dont want to take that risk.
retrogametech Its not too difficult. Just reconnect the traces that were severed and solder on some new components :) . No formal training, just learn as I go and watching vidsreading tuts online.
retrogametech Your skills are amazing...I watch all your videos and you help me improving my fixing skills...Keep on the good job...
retrogametech Thanks. Fixing stuff is fun :)
retrogametech damn finally man i actually missed you puttin vids up its been a while you narrate pretty nicely vids are interesting and all... keep puttin them up... you shud fix my original xbox needs a new PSU i guess
retrogametech Its probably a dodgy PSU. Pretty easy to replace :)
retrogametech OMG!! cant believe you have rescued this Martin, thank you so much for your time and skill, EPIC!!
retrogametech Amazing mate, so impressed!
retrogametech Great job,youre obviously very skilled in console repairs. Watching this video reminded me of a memory from my childhood.I went to an independent games shop in Leeds with my mum back in the early 90s and the shop was packed.Everyone was buying Japanese megadrives in boxes.But I just didnt understand why there was so much interest in the funny looking megadrives at the time. Now looking back I wonder if the shop had modified the megadrives internally to operate with PAL TVs.
retrogametech Wow thanks! You have some skills there! I mean I tried to fix a PS2 controller, a PSP and a PS1.. All of them are not working : But I wont give up. Thanks for responding and keep posting these videos!
retrogametech Ive been watching your vids for the past few weeks and you have inspired me to start fixing faulty consoles again. Just love it how you able to bring retro consoles back from the dead just superb.
retrogametech think wire glue (or any conductive glue) placed over the traces would have fixed it? Minus the capacitor that will obviously need a little work.
retrogametech Wow, youre lucky these boards were only double layered and didnt have any traces between the top and bottom sections otherwise that would be a dead board! Great work
retrogametech Wicked, absolutely wicked! I have a dreamcast if your interested lmao
retrogametech I got to fix my Genesis after watching this. The sound works, but there is no video. I also have the 32x and Sega CD.
retrogametech Hey Rtg fancy having a look at my Famicom? I live in Glasgow to and will pay for it of course
retrogametech Not seen to many of those but Id guess a lot of them just have dirtycorroded battery terminals.
retrogametech Yep, the conversion looked like it was done in a hurry by someone who really didnt care.
retrogametech So many repair places wouldnt of bothered with that repair, but it shows just how skilled this repair was! Great stuff man, really looked like toast with those large cracks.
retrogametech Haha, no more repairs from me for a while! :P
retrogametech Do u JTAG consoles locally?
retrogametech Great work my friend, your just like me bringing things back to life. Awesome repair 1010 keep the good work up I love watching your vids .
retrogametech Btw there is no need for background music in your vids :) its nice without
retrogametech Excellent job on the repair Martin! well impressed :)
retrogametech Great video man and a great repair from a fellow Scot. Really been enjoying your stuff. If you dont mind me asking, where did you learn your electronic wizardry?
retrogametech wow I think I posted on his original vid how difficult that would be to fix  impressive!
retrogametech Awesome! I love the Lets Repair Series, Keep it up!
retrogametech Does anyone else hear a faint high pitched noise in the background? If not it might just be my speakers.
retrogametech you can replace those microswitches with the pushbuttons you showed ! look over at mmmonkey, he has done it before, its no big deal.
retrogametech this is a great video, thanks man
retrogametech I love your repair vids, they are so pleasant and interesting to watch!
retrogametech Probably half and half to be honest, but if I play MS I usually only use the NGCD controller for some reason. Once, if I can ever find one that is, I get a AES controller that will be all I use pretty much.
retrogametech It kinda is the trickiest part on the controller to clean and rebuild but its really pretty easy :P . Thanks for watching and commenting! :)
retrogametech I have one, got it from JammaNationX, for cheap too and works great, they deep clean and test everything, but if I ever have a problem I know where to go now :)
retrogametech This was a huge help!! Ive been agonizing trying to cut out those little white discs.
retrogametech Hey buddy ! Great Vid ! your just like the king of repairs ! anyways i wanted ask how much if you dont mind saying, you got your neogeo console for ? plus what were the games you were playing in the vid ? Thanks man !
retrogametech Yes another repair video soo cool thanks!!!
retrogametech Thanks. Even if it was beyond repair I would have used it for spares or another project. Appreciate the support :)
retrogametech Thanks Luke. I couldnt find that tut you mentioned. Where abouts on the site is it and Ill throw a link into the description along with the others. Love these controllers! They have a really satisfying click to them and are perfectly shaped.
retrogametech Brilliant mate. I love what you do :)
retrogametech Could you mod the NeoGeo CD controller to work with a Mega Drive?
retrogametech I miss my Neo Geo CDZ....
retrogametech Ahhh.. I see what you did there! Yes it is indeed a joy to use. If only the Mega Drive had had something like this! Better yet, get rid of that crappy dpad on the 360 controller and replace it with one like this! :)
retrogametech Thanks. Very true! Its so frustrating when I heard someone say they junked a whole systemcontroller just because it developed a small fault. So many useful parts wasted! :( Im just really glad I managed to remember where Id stored those little contact discs! :P
retrogametech How would you approach the repair if you did not have any spare parts? Still possible?
retrogametech Martin, watching you fix an old controller is better than an network T V tat!
retrogametech Thanks for your videos.I like them a lot.Do you use regular cleaning material for the plastic parts like liquid soap or an industrial cleaner?
retrogametech i swear i find the the dpad from neo geo Cd controllers the best dpad ever made, shame it breaks a lot :(
retrogametech Do you think that ds xl ones will fit well too? I have one that my son broke in pieces...
retrogametech Awesome, heres a request if you can, There is a controller for Wii U you have probaly heard of called the Controller Pro U by inerworks. The Dpad doesnt work so well on alot of them and the reset button isnt big enough, you need a pin to reset it. Can you do a video showing how to fix the dpad if posible and how to make the reset button a bit bigger or easyer to press. It would help ALOT of people including my self. Thank you
retrogametech good to know in case mine ever breaks
retrogametech Breakers. Its a very basic but fun fighter :)
retrogametech Do you use your much? Or do you prefer the arcade stick?
retrogametech im looking for this controller so if someone has spare one to sell drop me msg thx
retrogametech You seem to have very very much knowledge about retro consoles, nice fix again!
retrogametech your from ayrshire or there abouts right? do i win a cookie
retrogametech Just regular cleaning items, nothing fancy. I normally just mix some shampoo into very hot water. Throw all the parts in and leave them to sit for 5min. After that I use an old tooth brush to scrub all the dirtgrim off. Works great! :)
retrogametech clic clic clic clic clic clic clic clic clic clic clic clic how people can play whit these controller ? its a torture .
retrogametech I wish the PS2 controller was as easy to fix as this. Your main problem here seemed to be a massive accumulation of shite inside the controller and a couple of distorted micro switch discs. A very informative video, good stuff.
retrogametech what did you search to find this
retrogametech Its definitely one of the best! :)
retrogametech Just needed a clean and reseat. Nothing worth showing )
retrogametech You can buy replacement switches, I think allelectronics or digikey has some that are the same size. what are the dimensions of the switches in mm?
retrogametech Another great video Martin. You seem to be some sort of retro gaming wizard with the eBay finds and repairs. Look forward to the next video!
retrogametech Awesome, 2 videos in such A short time!
retrogametech Glad you like them :)
retrogametech Same as with the last controller. Id just find a faulty GBA SP and harvest those discs from its mobo :)
retrogametech There is nothing this man cant repair! Great video!
retrogametech Although I will never own one of these controllers I still find it entertaining watching you fix it. Looking forward to more repair videos
retrogametech Thanks. Theres a mod to do something similar to this but its a lot of work and Id imagine youd lose that original feel.
retrogametech I absolutely love these videos.
retrogametech How do you still play them games?
retrogametech Thanks dude! Haha, its funny because I actually had considered that. The charity shop where I got the little Sony had another identical model for sale. It was gone buy the time I went back but it would have mad a cool little mini cab project :) . I have zero room for even a mini cab though so probably for the best! :P
retrogametech i noticed on alot of your videos you say you sell stuff on ebay i was just wondering if it would be possible to get a link so i can see what you have for sale? thanks :)
retrogametech Thanks! Sometimes I wonder if making these vids will actually just bore the crap outta people, haha. Its really nice to hear when someone says they enjoyed watching. Cheers!
retrogametech Hell yeah! Fucking awsome bro...hope you get a high score useing this controller! You really did a fine job ! Peace and happy gameing
retrogametech When the convex button becomes concave it makes constant contact with the other plate hence registering the button as always on. This repair was first introduced by Xian Xi and can be found on the Jammanationx website. You can use regular microswitches but it requires more work. Nice little fix there Martin
retrogametech You have good taste in controllers and PC monitors. You should put the new smaller microswitches inside the hollowed out proprietary switches )
retrogametech Theres plenty! I just dont make vids about it! :P
retrogametech Haha, yeah what a surprise, another ebay seller sending out filthy items. Maybe I should invest in a box of disposable latex gloves for these vids :P.
retrogametech Thanks! Im never quite sure if anyone will be too interested in watching me repair stuff like this.
retrogametech What was wrong with the sunken select button?
retrogametech Hey Martin, I checked the site and couldnt find it either but I found his video on here. I cant add the video link but if you want to do so you will have to just put in the title and you can find it. Its Titled: How to Fix a Broken NeoGeo CD Pad Controller :) Hopefully that will help out a bit. The controllers are great and very nice to use for sure. I wish they werent going up in price all over the place recently, just unreal.
retrogametech Nothing, it just needed cleaned and reseated. Sticky buttons, a common issue with all controllers if theyre not kept clean. :)
retrogametech they are fairly cheep and aslong as you have a wii it will work with that, its just made for compatability with wii u. anyways, i love your videos so i understand if you cant do it!
retrogametech Nice, you should do a tutorial where you clean a console or a controller (for example the product that you use, something like that), heres my advice. :)
retrogametech Excellent repair Martin!! I love to see something broken Fixed, theres just something special about it. Cheers Martin
retrogametech I dont think u could ever find deals like that here in the states. Too bad.
retrogametech Lazy i understand, I enjoy watching been watching since 2010 when I started using YouTube and this is still my favorite channel. I also wanted to throw out, these videos are definitely not boring! I love to see people fixing videogame related stuff that otherwise would be thrown away. These things arent made anymore, we have to save as many as we can and only resort to cannibalizing them if theyre beyond repair.
retrogametech I doubt you shorted it. Its probably just got dirty contacts somewhere or maybe a worn cable.
retrogametech First comment. Another great video!
retrogametech Time for a rebuild! A lot of the time those discs can just be refurbished instead of completely replaced. But GBA SPs contain the parts if you need them.
retrogametech Cheers for watching and taking the time to comment! :)
retrogametech Haha, thanks. I appreciate you watching. Id post more if I wasnt so lazy!
retrogametech Why didnt you spray it with compressed air?
retrogametech Thanks. Ebay deals are mostly just luck and knowing when to look :P
retrogametech Its amazing what can be fixed if you just know how. Thanks for another great video as always.
retrogametech Thanks. Ive got a couple of working Neo Geo MVS boards at the moment. I paid around or just under 50 for each. The price really depends on the version you go for and condition. I see a lot of older working MVS boards sell for around 40. The games I was playing were Breakers and Robo Army. Breakers is probably my favourite fighting game on the system :)
retrogametech Pretty sure you cant. I wish you could though. They appear to be proprietary SNK and designed specifically to fit inside that black plastic housing.
retrogametech Cool project. Glad you got it working. Neo Geo Rocks!
retrogametech great job fixing it dude! you should make arcade out of that tv and your neo geo, that would be soo cool dude :)
retrogametech Looks much better now, at the start it looked like it would be safer to handle with rubber gloves.
retrogametech yeah I love buying broken controllers and fixing them real fast
retrogametech Thats cool, but I personally think it would be complete with the original Ubisoft logo... And used the commodore or something instead of the Sega Megadrive... But yeah, thats me...
retrogametech Awesome cover! However, even though its not the way it should be, wouldnt it be cooler if you inverted the colors of the barcode on the back of the color? Black background with white stripes? And... please make more of these covers?
retrogametech I checked this game out cuz of this vid and omg its amazing! As an 80s kid I thoroughly enjoyed it so thanks dude. Also good job on the case cover...very convincing :)
retrogametech I checked this game out cuz of this vid and omg its amazing! As an 80s kid I thoroughly enjoyed it so thanks dude. Also good job on the case cover...very convincing :)
retrogametech Yeah, maybe in future theyll release a full blown sequel with the original on disc :)
retrogametech Now find someone to make a demake for it for the mega drive.... Probably would have been a side scroller run and gun.
retrogametech Ive been enjoying this game immensely and this has just added to it. Awesome idea and it turned out well.
retrogametech Thanks, looking forward to having a physical version
retrogametech Looks amazing and it was made in Scotland :) you can not get better than that
retrogametech One of my friends says that blood dragon sucks and that first your trying to survive on a island and then your on some stupid techno island. Fucking kids these days.
retrogametech damn it looks so legit. what printer do you use? ive wanted to print a few gba covers and a gameboy player disc custom cover
retrogametech Sounds like your friend is mixin up far cry 3 and blood dragon. Far cry 3 youre surviving on island and in blood dragon youre on intentionally stupid techno island. In my opinion its the best shooter ive played for time. I recommend it for eightiesearly ninities or before born ppl just so youll get the idea.
retrogametech Looks good as shit imitation beat you get people asking you to make them now
retrogametech You should send a pic of this to the Bloodragon developers and say Hey, I bought the game, but the box was empty! :D
retrogametech Thanks for the video :)
retrogametech I have a JTAG hacked console but you can do that on a normal 360 anyway :P. Id really just like to see an official disc release :)
retrogametech LOL, you make bootleggers(that do it as a business) look like amateurs.
retrogametech Awesome artwork. Subbed.
retrogametech Thanks. Yeah Id love to see a proper disc release for PS3360 :)
retrogametech Thanks for inspiring. I decided to make my own version for the Genesis. Check it out at my Deviant site: JoeyV104
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech I sometimes make my own cases for downloadable games (Like the Walking Dead, Journey e.t.c) since I need to have a tangible asset for my collection. This though, this is genious, defo printing one of these off tomorrow and sticking it on my shelf. Badass. Powerglove FTW.
retrogametech Great effort. Great idea and a great game.
retrogametech Thanks. The game is tons of fun. Great sense of humour and brilliant soundtrack!
retrogametech Almost.. :P What ever happened to that 360 you picked up a while back? Did you manage to fix it? 360PS3 wont be modern for too much longer :P
retrogametech It would be pretty awesome to modify the case of a Sega Megadrive and put new hardware inside. Then make a cardridge with some USB stick inside which contains the actual installed game :P Then you basicly have your own next gen retro console for which you can make these bootlegs XD Atleast it would do more than sit at your shelf. Ive seen people do that with a NES so it should be doable with a Megadrive though its kinda small and tricky to get everything fitting. New project idea for you? :)
retrogametech Download, print, cut, insert in box, done! :)
retrogametech Thanks. I have the design for a cart worked out in my head. Just need to get the time to make it :)
retrogametech I know you can buy the disc version for PC but a console release would be awesome. Preferably Mega Drive ).
retrogametech Im a noob at photoshop so I found it fun and frustrating all at the same time :P.
retrogametech Pretty cool work there man, who knows, they made Halo 2600 right, this could happen too if the demand is high enough
retrogametech Now that would be awesome! haha
retrogametech somebody should make this game a homebrew sidescroller shooter and release it for the genesismegadrive. i remember halo came out for the atari. and angry birds has a homebrew genesis cartridge too.
retrogametech my suggestion? copy the dlc onto a usb memory stick formated by the xbox and stick it in there with a nice label on it. a cf card would look better but eh you cant use them with an xbox
retrogametech A nice idea. Executed well. Good stuff Martin
retrogametech Now that would be awesome! haha
retrogametech somebody should make this game a homebrew sidescroller shooter and release it for the genesismegadrive. i remember halo came out for the atari. and angry birds has a homebrew genesis cartridge too.
retrogametech my suggestion? copy the dlc onto a usb memory stick formated by the xbox and stick it in there with a nice label on it. a cf card would look better but eh you cant use them with an xbox
retrogametech Haha, I think a ROM hack is in order :P
retrogametech Sweeet, i wouldnt mind playing a 16 bit version of this game.
retrogametech I have yet to play this game :( Im a massive sega fan too :) you can buy this on pc at the shops. but I think your custom sega case looks so much better
retrogametech Pitch that idea to Ubisoft and dont forget to tell them to pay you )
retrogametech That box is amazing. 1010.
retrogametech Looks awesome, adding a cart would be nice touch. Have you thought about doing any others?
retrogametech that is god damn cool. id like to do the same for apple jack.. my favourite xbox live game and one thats also quite retro..
retrogametech The question remains: Will you go as far as to port this game to the megadrive?
retrogametech Talk about a missed promotional opportunity. Id pay extra money just to get a code in a box like that
retrogametech nice job ! i dl the game today on psn ,i hope i enjoy it
retrogametech Awesome work and thanks for sharing! Totally looks like the real deal!
retrogametech actually, thats still a Physical release
retrogametech Sure, why not! But I think the 32X addon will be required for full 1080p :P
retrogametech Its loads of fun. Ive been burnt out on first person shooters for a while now. Stopped playing COD a few games back and found Halo 4BioShock Infinite really dull. Blood Dragon on the other hand has a very OTT pisstake, Duke Nukem, oldschool attitude and feel to it. Its a total blast to play :). The sound and art design are brilliant as well! Ive not played any of the Farcry games since the original one on Xbox. Never been a big fan.
retrogametech Mint mate, looks cracking :)
retrogametech Its going to such when things go DL only :( .
retrogametech did you put it the install on a cd and place it inside?
retrogametech Brilliant stuff, i printed this out and made one myself earlier. Showed it off in my latest video. youl have to let me know if you ever do more as you did a bloody fantastic job!
retrogametech Haha, they should release it in the style of an old game like this or maybe in a VHS box. Its a great game :)
retrogametech Im slowly working through my list of projects, but that one is still about 10th on the list. My goal is to wait until it is considered retro.
retrogametech The Pc version has a physical version here in Austria
retrogametech Nice work, love your videos and projects mate :)
retrogametech Thats some excellent work there going to download the image.
retrogametech I need to finish this game!
retrogametech Just out of curiosity could you make a tutorial video of how you made this because I would like to make Pal blue box art for my copy of vectorman 2 so that it fits in my collection nicely :)
retrogametech Haha, cool idea! Dont think Id have the skillpatience for that though :P
retrogametech Thats awesome man. They released a hard copy of it on PC here in Australia. I must say im loving both the game and the soundtrack.
retrogametech What do you have in front of the Mega Drive? at 6:30 (in the bottom, a semicircle that says SEGA) where it should have the cable cords for the controllers? Or Genesis had a Wireless version?How do you modded it for having PAL  NTSC? I want to do it with mine (and all my consoles but SNES and NES because I like the look of both... And TurboGrafxPCEngine)
retrogametech So THATS what the little hole on the back of my Genesis is for. Not the extension port, the little hole to the left of it. The model 2 has a small hole in the back too though, and I still have no idea what thats for.
retrogametech i like sega because if they say their gonna release periferals they do unlike nintendo.
retrogametech love how people spelled NET WORK SYSTEM back then.
retrogametech I always thought that little hole was made for something else
retrogametech if you look on YouTube some guys got the rom for this and rebuild the server so you can play like it is 1994 , i think emu only :( , Snes has this to it did games shows sat radio and more , you could even get Zelda link to the past 2 , 3ds one is not 2
retrogametech HAHAHA. The number he put in upsidedown spells boobies
retrogametech How much did this set you back? If I pick one up myself will you be up for a game of cyberball? :)
retrogametech With this modem, you can call at 1990
retrogametech great review man, never saw this. I knew the DC had the first one built in and I knew about xband and the famicon one with the lottery ticket fiasco too LOL. but this is just great!
retrogametech The Dreamcast must be the first home console could play online out of the box. That apparently was one of the features they refused to remove despite being suggested to save manufacturing costs.
retrogametech Pretty crazy for a 1990 console game! :)
retrogametech this device plus someone who is enterprising enough to do a custom ROM to take advantage of this (the MDGenesis Everdrive would do it) could do some interesting things with it )
retrogametech wow who knew that there was a Sega Modem before the Sega Channel? I learned something new today.
retrogametech Hey Martin sorry to bother you but I have been watching your videos for some time now, and you seem fairly knowledgeable about video game consoles, So if you wouldnt mind answer a question for me. I have a sega master system first gen. that has been sitting up for some time now almost 2 years, Recently I hooked it up and it works its just when i play games the colors change on every game. I have cleaned them and everything so if you have an idea please help.
retrogametech Not all Dreamcasts came bundled with the modem. Some of the Asian SKUs didnt. Instead they had a detachable dummy modem in its place. Ive got a couple of those sitting in my cupboard somewhere. The Euro and American units all came with modems though I think.
retrogametech Good, now add the Karaoke machine and put a 4 controller tap on there and fill all the slots! HAHA! Make the Mega drive suffer!
retrogametech 7:33 anyone notice he typed boobies LOL
retrogametech That is extremely cool! I wish it had made its way to the U.S.
retrogametech Its definitely disappointing the way things are headed. Soon youll only be able to digitally rent games. And when the publisher decides its no longer profitable to support it, youll loose all access :( . But as a retro gamer my backlog will take more than a lifetime to play through :P
retrogametech Sega was ahead of its time. If only they are still around, no doubt would bring out a beast of a console for todays market.
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Is this like the Sega Saturn where you can still play online without lag or did these run on servers?
retrogametech Thanks! I appreciate that. Thanks for watching the vids! :)
retrogametech As he said its peer to peer, which means it doesnt need any outside service. For example if me and you wanted to play Cyberball online we would have to arrange a time to start then Id dial your home telephone number using the on screen phone in the game. It would then connect with your Megadrive (using typical modem sounds you used to hear on dialup) and wed start playing. It would just cost you the price of the call.
retrogametech It might just need its capacitors replaced. Its a pretty common fault with GameGears and not too difficult to fix. You can buy kits with all the parts you need online and there are a few tuts on youtube showing you how to do it. Maybe give it a shot yourself and make a project out of it? :P Id like to help but I dont do repairs on anything other than my own stuff these days, sorry. Also, the postage alone would probably cost as much as the console anyway! :P Thanks for watching btw! :)
retrogametech Wow, thats the most stuff Ive ever seen plugged into Genesis as one time!
retrogametech that is so fucking cool that it still works.
retrogametech Wow, talk about ahead of its time. I had no idea about this modem or pack. I feel even more sorry that Sega is out of the hardware business. Hope they will be back someday...
retrogametech Not much. Under 40? Cant remember off the top of my head. You can usually get them loose for around 2030.
retrogametech Wow that Cyberball game is awesome not only because of the game but because it had p2p multiplayer :D
retrogametech Ive heard of it but didnt know they supported it until 2000. Thats pretty crazy! Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Nice i see you have the official wireless controller box on your model one thats nice i should get a modem and try it out.
retrogametech dude u got one sick mega drive!!
retrogametech so THATS whats that hole was for!!!!!!
retrogametech Great video Martin! Didnt know they had a modem for the Mega Drive  have you ever heard about the Satellaview for the old Super Famicom? Really interesting way that Nintendo provided a sort of DLC for subscribers, the service ran until about 2000.
retrogametech Thanks for watching. Glad you found it interesting :)
retrogametech Its great that the modem still works today. I wanna track down a broadband adapter for my Dreamcast and play some Phantasy Star Online :P
retrogametech I find it a bit strange that they remove the rear ext port on later revisions of the hardware as they still could have used it with other peripherals thou personally have no idea what. Just that this was basicly way to ahead of its time I suppose   nobody really wanted to play a game with someone in separate houses in those days.
retrogametech its sad that sega left the console market considering how groundbreaking and innovative they were, way ahead of the game. sad thing is, if they just lagged behind 6 years like nintendo, maybe they would still be alive today.
retrogametech I thought the dreamcast was the first to start this but damn I miss sega counsels ),: we should have a kickstart for another sega counsel
retrogametech Haha, Technically we still can. xD Just need to gather a community of people with modems and copies of CyberBall organised. :P But it would be cool if the SEGA servers were still up and you could download the games etc )
retrogametech Wow I never knew the megadrive had its own modem that is pretty cool. Too bad its kinda useless nowadays. Still a pretty cool thing to have for collectors. I own the sega dreamcast and I cant even get it online cause all we have are ethernet cables. :(
retrogametech awesome vid mate just got a mega drive 1 with the expansion port and was wandering what it was for. now i know :)
retrogametech Damn that genesis is getting gang banged in literally every port at once.
retrogametech I wish Sega was still in the console business.
retrogametech lol that would be awesome if we could play online with that beast :D
retrogametech Really informative video martin. Im a big fan of the mega drive too. As a kid it was one of my favourite consoles.
retrogametech because they had real experience making arcades from long time ago...
retrogametech Im sure you guys know, but the Snes had one also, called Satellaview, a satellite modem that had a very similar interface to what is now on the Wii U, with the little online area you walk around.
retrogametech I remember seeing a advert for in the mean machines magazine back in the 90s. Pretty cool you tracked one down today. Awesome vid.
retrogametech Thank you for bringing it to our attention! I would never have known about it otherwise.
retrogametech Great vid, i never knew they done this for the mega drive, thanks for sharing it!!
retrogametech I wonder how hard it would be to code an emulation for these modems. Would love to experience it, or maybe even do the hardware mods to make it work on our phone lines.
retrogametech PlayStation 2 is the reason why SEGA faild
retrogametech Great video review Martin. Sega was sure way ahead of its time.
retrogametech This is so awsome! Cant wait too get one of these. Your Genesis megadrive is fucking solid bro..makes this old man smile! Peace and happy gameing
retrogametech Redonkulous isnt it? :P Online banking in the 90s using a Mega Drive!? Google the pics for Sega Mega Answer if you havent seen it already, haha. Funny you mention the MS 3D. Was messing around with that the other day on the little Sony CRT. The phrase holy shitballs! springs to mind! It works perfectly! Really surprising future consoles didnt adopt the tech and run with it.
retrogametech WOW great video, shocking that Sega had this for its system in 1990! The U.S. was left out such an advancement. If the modem sales did better in Japan, makes you wonder if it could have been released in the U.S.?
retrogametech What a neat piece of hardware. Its amazing how many things Japan got that we never did. Even if it didnt succeed, it would have been nice to have a chance at it. Its like the Nintendos FDS never seeing light in America. Its a shame they didnt give it a chance.
retrogametech Awesome stuff, can you do a similar video on the Saturn modem?
retrogametech I would if I had one :P
retrogametech I want one of these but Im not sure why lol Probably just to check out its insides :)
retrogametech Didnt the modem have the sonic Eraser?
retrogametech Thats insane! Who knew mega drive had a modem!
retrogametech Do you have any consoles you are waiting to selltrade because i just got an old channel F and i have no idea what to do with it
retrogametech im very jealous, you have the full sega power tower combo plus infrared controllers, cdx and now the megamodem. congratulations for show us this piece of history...finally know the reason of a hole in the back of Genesis. Regards!
retrogametech You can do your shopping at home or play Mortal Kombat with a friend in Vietnam
retrogametech How much have you paid for your boxed set?
retrogametech Way cool it still works! Cant say same thing with some of the newer discontinued online games.
retrogametech Thanks! Glad you enjoyed it :)
retrogametech basically a sega genesis could go online? wow
retrogametech How do you know we arent already? Maybe right now youre actually playing a Dreamcast 2 game! )
retrogametech Nice little collection piece.
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech I live in the land of RGB SCART :P . Watch my previous vid if youre interested to know more ). My SLG3000 vid and cable management vids also cover more details.
retrogametech Do you know if the modem would work on a Genesis in North America? I have the Sega Channel adapter and I love the old Sega peripherals. Thanks!
retrogametech So the internets has been lying to me? i feel violated.
retrogametech That is awesome thanks for sharing. I have a PAL Hong Kong system and on the back of the box there is a picture of the modem that was the first of me hearing of the device. This is the first video I have seen an it all makes sense the connections in the back even the screw hole lol. Great vid
retrogametech Been a while since the last vid. Missed you man!!
retrogametech Thats a can of worms Im staying well clear of! coughcoughWiiUcoughcough :P
retrogametech Awsome..i have been wanting too see you show this since your first video. This was even better than I anticipated thank you so much Bro.And keep up the great  interesting videos!
retrogametech smaller tvs has smaller or no gaps between the scanlines.
retrogametech ok so i get the collecting part. i do. i really really do. so collect them. but why dont people play the games on emulators more? it works so well now.. and its so simple...
retrogametech I LOVE CRTs, they are an absolute must for gaming, retro especially.Ive had nothing but problems going HD, with LCDLEDs and plasmas which both share a slew of problems(Motion blur, ABL, input lag, frame doubling for 30fps videogames ect) I keep falling back on my 27 Sony wega CRT SDTV. I had the 32 since the earlier 2000s and i absolutely loved it, but i switched to a 60 plasma as of late for my living room, but im not exactly too thrilled with its dim picture. IMy 27 Wega CRT however is super bright, black levels are great, no lag, a super crispsharp picture(using component cables) no ABL, no viewing angle issues, perfect crt motion, its a fantastic set.
retrogametech Lmao I get crts for nuffin...
retrogametech Soooo.... how do you access that hidden service menu? Would love to fix my Trinitron screen!
retrogametech Where did you buy your NG multicart from? If you dont mind me asking.
retrogametech What shop did you get the tv from Martin?
retrogametech Indeed, I was gonna say that the tv is too small for the scanlines to be visible but faginrs beat me to it. You shouldnt really be LOOKING for scanlines on a display screen rather than the actual visible effect the 15khz signal gives which you are getting perfectly fine on that tiny screen of yours )
retrogametech I see less and less of them already. Ebay used to be flooded with nice CRTs but not so much these days. Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech I think the best thing about CRT is the colour vibrancy :)
retrogametech Got the MVS running in attract mode and can stop looking at itdrooling :P
retrogametech Since SCART doesnt exist here, youd have to order them for each console at around 1520 USD each, which can add up up rather quickly for large collections since no one has any laying around. Component is close in quality, but the signal is more related to Svideo than RGB, and nothing older than a PS2 can do that natively. Not only is Svideo disappearing, but sets here are already starting to remove dedicated composite inputs, wanting you to put it through one of the component lines. Cheap.
retrogametech Not done anything like that but the Saturn is good for its arcade ports and 2D shooters. And the original Xbox has a pretty broad range of good games to choose from :)
retrogametech wasnt me. sorry i dont like or dislike videos usually. rgb and component can do 1080p? dont really think there is much different between them.
retrogametech very cool. i needs me some CRT action.. hadnt thought about gettin a wee one, that could be easily stored away when not in use.. hmm... decisions decisions..
retrogametech Sure is. I thought Id have to live with some of the picture missing.
retrogametech Hey, I have got exactly the same Little guy. :)
retrogametech Theres only a few reasons to be jealous of European gamers over US, like Shenmue 2, but SCART Tvs has to be the 1 reason, you guys have had quality RGB gaming for decades! I have a Sony PVM with RGB and a scartPVM adapter, Im never giving it up. :D
retrogametech Martin, if you pull the back off the telly youll usually find some pots on the rear of the PCB, focus, vhold hhold and more often than not pots for changing how much overscan is present, if theyre on adjustment sticks just put a couple holes above them in the back of the case to access via screwdriver when you need to, failing that just adjust to what you need and slap the back on again. The focus pot is a great way to fix fuzzy crts too
retrogametech This channel is awesome as fuck.
retrogametech As european I can say that our RGB TVs are and was the only salvation in the 90s and early 2000s. Thanks to his magic we was able to play NTSC consoles and games at the maximum quality. Discovered with the first Playstation, SCARTRGB was always my choice when possible. Too bad that SNES and N64 didnt have an RGB output...
retrogametech Like ghosting? Are your cables good qualitywell shielded? Dodgy cables can cause that type of effect. It might be something very simple to put right.
retrogametech Im pretty sure all Trinitrons have RGB input.
retrogametech When we gonna get to see a complete MVS consolized shell up and running.
retrogametech Put the ugly sticker off. Lovely set! :)
retrogametech Ive got one of these tvs. it was my mums bedroom telly, she never used it so its like brand new. The picture quality on it is so so sharp and clear it blows my 14 pvm away for clarity. The scanline issue (lack of) confuses me too. Ive tried pal and ntsc consoles and no lines. But its a great tv for retro like you say. Cheers for the service menu tip. Ill try it and see how much tube times been used, Id be amazed if its over 300 hours.
retrogametech Haha, perfect size to stash away in a cupboard when I need the space. Although it looks so good I now dont want to do that! :) Thanks for the tip. I wasnt sure at the time and didnt want to risk it. Ill remember that for future. I was thinking the TV was maybe upscaling the image or something? I thought theyd be a lot more predominant by default like with my other Trinitron. It looks beautiful all the same :)
retrogametech Great video. Ive not got a Sony CRT (currently have a Samsung) but Im now interested in finding out if mines RGB and if it has a hidden service menu too. Didnt realise Scart output could differ or CRTs had service menus. Thanks for bringing this to my attention.
retrogametech I have the Nintendo consoles hidden away in storage. The Wii can play my GameCube games and emulates everything else so thats good enough for me :). The typical Nintendo games like Zelda and Mario never appealed much to me as a kid and werent very popular in my part of the world. So I dont have any nostalgia for Nintendo. I grew up playing stuff like Streets of Rage, Golden Axe, After Burner, Road Rash and Sonic :) . Love my Sega and Arcade stuff :)
retrogametech Thats the same TV I have in the bedroom, got it back when I stayed in Holland i 2000. Still working great and picture still holds up!
retrogametech Im waiting for my RGB SCARTComponent converter since thats the only way to do it here. Plan to hook my MDMCD32x up via it. Cant wait to get rid of composite.
retrogametech imo same as this generations... last gen xbox vs ps2 xbox still had halo forza etc and some others but hes right on the saturn its the perfect 2d console overall its just it was wedged between past gen and next gen i think it would be 45th gen systems so it didnt work out so well and a pain to make games for it
retrogametech It usually depends on the console itself. For older consoles(Like the NES, SNES, MDG, and others) its probably only displaying at about 240i, with the only PALNTSC difference being that PAL consoles at the time ran at 50Hz, with NTSC at 60Hz. Although, for later consoles(Not sure when), PAL gets 576i, and NTSC gets 480i, with both displaying at about 60Hz. So, look up your consoles, and see what the resolution and Hz is. As for 25FPS Vs. 24, all it really does is create a problem in some DVDs
retrogametech In any case, im back over in Japan, you after any rare obscure stuff i can keep an eye out for? :)
retrogametech Only because you usually cant give them away these days. Most people just want CRTs out of their house!
retrogametech I gotta Sony PVM, Phillips CM8833 II, Phillips CM8833 mk1  the same Sony Telly as yours. Just cannot decide which one I prefer ahhhhhhhh
retrogametech why have everything going through 1 plug and not being able to use others for other stuff then have separate plugs for everything? WTF? Do you like plugging different devices into the same composite input or something?
retrogametech Do you have the model number?
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Interesting stuff. I didnt know that. Maybe building your own cables would be cheaper?
retrogametech You make a valid argument for modern televisions, but I still think youre crazy )
retrogametech Do you have the model number?
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Interesting stuff. I didnt know that. Maybe building your own cables would be cheaper?
retrogametech It would be awesome if you got that thing mounted on your wall
retrogametech Great vid mate. Cheers
retrogametech Hey Martin  I originally went for sony trinitron 15inch but found the screen a bit too small, then i went for BO 21inch it makes a huge difference, the scan lines are absolutely beautiful and much more defined due to the extra size, mainly use it with RGB connection for (snesmegadrive) but even the later consoles such as the PS2 also look really good,
retrogametech You can make MegadriveGenny cables since they use standard sockets, PCETG16 you can build a connector, but pretty much everything else needs a different proprietary connector, and they usually dont have all the pins populated so youd probably have to cut up an actual RGB cable to make a homemade RGB cable. You can pretty easily add a SCART socket to those arcade scaler boards, for the silly price of entry on just cables. Time to try undercutting and exporting boot sale SCART cable sets?
retrogametech Really? The last couple of TVs Ive owned produced scanlines on lowres inputs from the likes of my Mega DriveMaster System. The other Sony Trinitron I still own produces scanlines by default when hooked up to the MVS or any other retro console. Theyre supposed to be there and I think they look beautiful :)
retrogametech For a complete Sony CRT of this quality and condition with the remote? 15 is less than the cost of most video games! Are you mad? :P You should see the pixel perfect picture quality this thing produces now I have it fully optimised. Id put money on you drooling.
retrogametech So would you recommend me switching out my composite cable for an RGB? Im assuming you need an adapter to put the red, green and blue cables into so you can plug it into your SCART connection aye? Cheers for the help man.
retrogametech They are definitely great little tellys. Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Youre totally correct! You definitely still dont get it, lol :P Most TVs have 2 SCART sockets on the back as well as all those other inputs you mention. This TV even has 2 composite inputs on the front if youre crazy enough to want to use them. And you could buy a switcher if you need more than 2 SCART inputs. Basically our TVs are the same as yours but with the extra option of RGB SCART. Whats not to like? I notice this vid got its first dislike just when you commented,  coincidence? )
retrogametech I wish we stayed on CRT instead of LCDs, we could have a light weight flat CRT tvs and monitors.
retrogametech I used to take stuff from my local tip all the time :). Id regularly take home the PCs, consoles and monitors Id see sitting in the skips. But one day an attendant clocked me putting an old PC monitor in my car and he went ape shit! Demanded I put it back and claimed it was council property!! I tried to explain I was planning to use it for a project and it would end up in landfill otherwise. He was having none of it and told me to leave! lol. They dont let people take stuff anymore :(
retrogametech Charity shop called DebRA.
retrogametech I remember wanting a Sony Trinitron TV when I was younger for my SNES and PS1. I begged my parents one time when we were looking for a new TV, but they refused because the Trinitrons carried a significantly higher price than regular CRT televisions. Funny how its just so much cheaper now. Hey Martin, by the way, will you be doing a pickups video soon? Or a progress update on your cMVS? Just wondering.
retrogametech Almost every TV has a hidden service menu, google your TV make and model and service menu.
retrogametech The point of SCART is that it would have replaced all those other formats (SVideo, Composite, etc), and is much better quality to boot. Its not just those other types of cables in 1 wire, its an entirely different format. Kamen is wishing wed started with that from the beginning, so we wouldnt have Component or any of that other stuff, as there is literally no reason to use it over SCART. Its like how we should have switched to Metric, instead of Imperial. :)
retrogametech Its crazy that only a few years back people were paying a premium for these sets. Now you finds them for free or dirt cheap! :) CMVS update in the next few weeks hopefully :) . Not been buying much lately so no pickups to show :P
retrogametech Wow. Ive got a black one of that exact model haha only difference is i found mine next to a bin with the remote on top lol and it worked!
retrogametech D: Never had a original Xbox? OH NOES!!!
retrogametech I dont imagine I will be. If it looks even half as good as what you showed Ill be amazed :)
retrogametech I love these Sony trinitrons. Great quality TVs and perfect for retro gaming :)
retrogametech Do you get the same full SCART effect with the scart adapters that go on composite cables which were common in UK and here in Ireland?
retrogametech Thanks. I thought so too :)
retrogametech and does it matter what model playstation you have, will it pick up rgb trhough an rgb scart no matter what playstation? talking about the ps1. please write back. thanks
retrogametech That looks like a TV...... only smaller! :D :D The THREE dots on the SCART socket means its RGB (for your future reference). Each dot mean the R, G  B lines. I could see the scanlines when you zoomed in.... the size of the screen will make them less visible. If you turn the contrast down, they should become more prominant.
retrogametech PAL N64 (except for model NUS001(FRA) ) doesnt have an RGB output. Only composite. Its crap in terms of quality but still you can connect to any PAL TV. SCART connection (and cables) always carry composite video and stereo audio alongside optional svideo and RGB video.
retrogametech wish scart had picked up in the US, it makes so much more sense then the craziness we got p but we are all mostly HDMI now so I guess we all came together finally.
retrogametech It blew my geeky mind :P . Full control over my CRT? Yes please!
retrogametech Dont forget that the standard PAL resolution(576p576i) and framerate(25 FPS) is slightly higher than the standard NTSC resolution(480p480i) and framerate(24 FPS).
retrogametech I was going to mention that asking 15 for this seems a bit cheeky. In my local recycling tip people chuck TVs like this out all the time and they just leave them in a big container for anyone to take. Ive gotten quite a few nice little CRTs from there for my retro consoles.
retrogametech If you find your TVs model number type it into google with the words service menu. You should find what you need. All Trinitrons have a hidden service menu :)
retrogametech Thats very true. Here in Aberdeen, Scotland I didnt have any pals who owned a Nintendo. Everyone had the Master System or the Megadrive. If your parents had the money you were lucky enough to have both. Strange that it wasnt as popular here considering in the states that it was massive.
retrogametech what brand is your rgb scart? im trying to look for the best possible, is that a top 1 that youve got? please write back to me. thanks
retrogametech I found on of these in my apartments bin. Was in good working condition.
retrogametech So mine hidden menu is I, 5 volume the tv button Now Areo Fighter fits perfectly. :D
retrogametech I picked one these Tvs for 4 on a boot sale last year and its great for my gamecube and I use it for coin ops on Xbox and I prefer it to my LCD because these sound has a arcade feel to it. Also never knew about the service menu so thanks for that
retrogametech Yeah, exactly, no RGB...
retrogametech I love this sort of dedication. And I never knew how much I needed scanlines in my life. Wonderful!
retrogametech You should have just got the Hanzo. Its a VGA adapter with a scanline generator.
retrogametech Well its good you are happy.I cant imagine paying for such a device, especially considering I could just hook up my PC to a TV and use an emulator with filters that look way better than the unfiltered raw picture you showed. (the one without scanlines)
retrogametech If you are using the SLG, Scaler and Sync Strike for another console (such as your Megadrive) do you need to run a separate audio lead for the sound? I dont have a Dreamcast (yet) but Id like to try this with a few other old consoles I have. Thanks.
retrogametech : oh man I wish the america had scart
retrogametech This was very interesting and I do agree that it looks better with scanlines, thanks for the video.
retrogametech Do you think that scanline is the best option to play Dreamcast on a HDTV only for classic or arcade videogames? Or also for other videogames like Shenmue or Resident Evil Code Veronica?Im doubting whether buy a vga box with scanline or a vga scaler to HD for my currently vga box. Thanks
retrogametech Most oldschool consoles didnt support true interlaced video  they tricked the video system into displaying ONLY one field of video instead of the normal alternating video (evenodd lines)  resulting in true 60HZ play (and the reason for the warning about projection TVs  which often couldnt handle the increased actual frame rate). This is the normal reason for these black scan lines on many TVs
retrogametech Just imagine how this would look with a quality vga mod installed into the Dc instead of the box.
retrogametech A device dedicated to black lines is silly !
retrogametech sorry but is there any way to use some sort of scanline generator for normal composite RCA connections? I have all these consoles and they all look like garbage, having two tvs in my living room just makes it looks silly and cluttered.
retrogametech Thanks :) . A quality Sony PVM looks like the optimum solution for getting the most out of these old systems :) . Imagine a wall of stacked PVMs! One for each console :P
retrogametech Do you know anything that replicates the blur effect that the arcade games from the 80s  earlymid 90s using CRT monitors had? I have a supergun that I use to play my arcade boards on my CRT TV but the blur effect seen on arcade monitors is of course missing. The SLG 3000 would help with the scanlines, but my TV only has composite inputs. Still I would love to get that blur effect.
retrogametech Great vid man, I bought one for my arcade machine since I replaced my monitor with 24inch led screen and slg3000 works awesome and picture is 10X better then before, slg3000 rocks
retrogametech The dreamcast port of SFA3 looks pretty good.
retrogametech RetroGameTech, all youre missing is the scaler and the syncstrike. Cheers!
retrogametech Yeah games like DoA arent as noticeable. I generally turn the scanlines down so they arent as intense for those games. It does however add a little extra depth and the menustext really benefit from it.
retrogametech Haha, its great you can now pick up quality devices like a BO telly for so cheap. I got myself a really nice late model CRT Sony Trinitron for 25 a few years back. I still use it for hooking up my MVS board. Lovely! :)
retrogametech I just use my old TV for my retro gaming D
retrogametech Positive about that. I tested many times on my tv set 40 Sony LCD and the result in my opinion is very good, light scanline effect, very nice and smooth.
retrogametech That is a nice device. You cant beat scanlines. :)
retrogametech In my opinion, the picture on a CRT computer monitor looks better than this. I understand the convenience of having all of your consoles hooked up to one TV, but for me, it makes more sense to have an HDTV for modern consoles and a nice CRT for retro games. I dont see any reason to buy a device that simulates the real thing when I could just use the real thing itself.
retrogametech Thanks. I got mine direct from Arcade Forge in Germany. Im not sure where else sells them.
retrogametech Nice video, would this work between a vga box to a vga2hdmi scaler box or would the hdmi scaler get rid of the scanlines. ?? Thanks
retrogametech you might want to have a look at SLGinaBox and put a scart multiplicator on it.
retrogametech looks like a great bit of kit. you cant beat some scanlines :)
retrogametech I dont get it. Non of my old consoles on old TVs had black scan lines. It looks interesting and all, but I dont see the appeal.
retrogametech Im Lazy And UnSkilled, I Might Try One For The WiiGamecube If I Can Figure it Out. (I Was Thinking It Was Those Horizontal lines That Travel Up Or Down The TV) I Put My Piece Of Shit Laptop Out Of Commission, Gonna Spend My Next Paycheck getting My Trusty Ol PC Working.... Yet Again.
retrogametech It really varies game to game. Some look better without it, and some with. One thing Ive noticed is text clarity always seems to benefit from scanlines. Ive never seen the official DC VGA box either. I assume it must be pretty rare. Its odd because SEGA went to the trouble of marking VGA Compatible on the back of many games. Youd think theyd have promoted the peripheral itself a little harder.
retrogametech RGB makes a really big difference IMO. Its so nice to be able to clearly see each individual pixel in a sprite. And the added colour vibrancy is stunning :) . Haha, I shot, edited and uploaded this vid twice before I was happy with it. It was really tricky to accurately capture and give a sense of what is seen with the naked eye. Its good to hear people like what they see. Cheers, Luke!
retrogametech but SLGinabox cost 170 EUROS!!!! the heart of this system its a chinese PCB with GBS8220 signalupscaler processor, this PCB cost 40USD, the quality is just acceptable, but the price fot SLG.i.a.B its a bad joke. Regards!
retrogametech Silly me! Ive watched it when you released the video and today I remembered to comment and didnt remembered that you had the full kit! Is it possible to connect an NES using composite ( Scart NES are somewhat rare and expensive!) to the scaler and get image? I plan to connect all of my consoles to the Kit and I dont know if Im able to connect the NES. I use an HP W2408H monitor for my recent consoles. Cheers!
retrogametech Thats maybe got more to do with my cameras white balance compensating for the switching. If it looks too dark with scalines then you can just adjust your TVs backlight, contrast and brightness settings.
retrogametech you might want to have a look at SLGinaBox and put a scart multiplicator on it. thats how i run my consoles on modern tv. its awesome. i also have to agree: rgb is the best you can get. on genesis, master system and saturn its no issue to get an rgb signal...sega ftw
retrogametech Nice explanation of the SLG3000.. I have one and am really pleased with it. Got it mainly for garou mark of the wolves and sonic CD on the 360 and anything else retro for that matter :) I was also really wanting to use it for PS3 but pal PS3s dont even do a 640x480 signal! the lowest it goes is 576ip (50hz to boot!!) how silly is that? :(
retrogametech Thanks :) . There are other devices like the XRGBmini that do a better job  are an allinone solution. But those can get pretty damn expensive. The SLG is a very nice little low budget alternative :) . I definitely think everyone who has a Dreamcast should own a VGA box! Makes games looks amazing :)
retrogametech In the not too distant future sourcing good quality, working, CRTs is going to get pretty challenging. Ive noticed it becoming much less common to find them discarded at the side of the road or cheap on ebay. It seems like many of them have already found their way to landfill.
retrogametech It really gives 2D games a nice arcady look :D . Thanks for watching!
retrogametech Retrogametech, just bought a dreamcast and loving every minute. It makes a fair noise when reading discs. I assume that if I opened it up and greased its cogs and lazer running track it might help, but what grease would you advise?

retrogametech I always play retro games on a small 14 inch crt tv, so i dont really see the scanline spaces, the beam is too thick to leave gaps. on a bigger tv on the other hand, like 20 inches or if you stand really close to the action like with an arcade cabinet its more distinct. i have never seen scanlines as the biggest difference between crt and lcd tvs, its something else. for me maybe its more about the colors, lack of lag, that theres no native resolutions and the analog feel of it.
retrogametech Retrogametech, just bought a dreamcast and loving every minute. It makes a fair noise when reading discs. I assume that if I opened it up and greased its cogs and lazer running track it might help, but what grease would you advise?
retrogametech Thanks. I actually bought the scaler, SLG and Sync Strike after seeing your vids, haha. I linked to your channel in the description so anyone looking for more in depth explanation can check out your vids. You do a much better job of explaining the technical side of things when it comes to these devices. The console I was really surprised with was the Wii. In a 4:3 ratio at 480p  scanlines it looks great! Games like HOTD Overkill, Mario Kart and A Boy And His Blob seem to benefit nicely.
retrogametech Do whatever it takes to get RGB out of your systems! :) You wont regret it xD
retrogametech Sounds cool. On some consoles and games I like the clean blocky look better. On others I prefer the scanlines. Its all down to personal preference I suppose. Its nice to have the option though :)
retrogametech If you use this would a lightgun work with a lcd?
retrogametech Thanks for the video, didnt know there was a product like this will definitely be updating my Mame cabinet with this.
retrogametech where can this be bought from, which site?
retrogametech Does the scanline generator only work with a 640x480 feed?
retrogametech lol, I search SLG 3000 on Ebay and Amazon, and all I get is fire trucks..
retrogametech I didnt think that 480p games would benefit from scanlines but it does provide a kind of fake antialiasing effect that works surprisingly well.
retrogametech i wouldnt have expected the scan lines to make such a difference on jet set radio
retrogametech I didnt know that about the PS3, thats kinda surprising. I have the VGA cable for 360 but havent got around to testing it with the SLG yet. I hear its very good for shooters like Deathsmiles and retro ports like you mentioned.
retrogametech Very nice explanation of what is now a legendary retro device. :) Its probably worth underlining that this device is best suited to games that were natively designed for 240p output, which is predominantly 2D stuff. Most 3D (480i and 480p) video is best displayed at either 480i or 480p. Proper hires stuff (480p) shouldnt really have scanlines, but some people may prefer this effect. Personally I try to recreate the original look.
retrogametech Thanks xD . It was a nightmare trying to shoot this video without it looking like ass! :P
retrogametech Very cool! I would definitely pick one of these up, if I didnt still use CRT televisions for gaming. This would also be great for a MAME cabinet utilizing an LCD monitor.
retrogametech Youre new to the Dreamcast, so it may appear to be noisy to you. But to me, hearing the noise of the DC disc drive certainly has a Pavlovian effect of awesomeness. Everytime I hear a Dreamcast fire up, whether in the same room, or on a video, it makes me want to get my Dreamcast fix on. Someday Tom... you will know what I mean.
retrogametech no frame drops, no jerkiness, no weird upscaling that adds things to the picture that the artists didnt draw. lcds are too perfect and the low resolution becomes really apparent and like a mosaic, especially on the 50 inch monsters we have today. but one thing about this black lines is that it makes our brain handle the scaling and fill in those gaps and it does a much better job than any software scaler ever will do.
retrogametech I am trying to get rid of those scanlines on my crt . With 60Hz rgb you get those on a pal TV.
retrogametech I never thought anybody would want the lines on their TV, then again it does add that Nostalgic feeling.
retrogametech Very easy. The scaler isnt needed for the DC, though :)
retrogametech A VGA box is a must have !
retrogametech Itll definitely help but the DC is well known for having a very distinct sounding and noisy drive regardless. I use a good quality bike grease on mine. But any light mechanical grease is fine :) . Just dont use too much :P
retrogametech is that vga box you have there from Consolegoods? it looks very similar to theres if it is is it any good? i got one of there mega drive rgb cables for my lcd tv and it works great and look amazing just wanna know so i dont waste any money
retrogametech Yea if you have the space.. then a bulky crt is the more sensible road.. u could probably get a nice crt for cheaper than the actual SLG3000 btw :p
retrogametech Was there an official SEGA VGA box? Ive never seen one.
retrogametech awesome video. that looks to be well worth it. whats the best place to get one?
retrogametech Just fired up my Dreamcast through RGB with a scanline generator for the first time a few minutes ago.. bloody hell, lol. Very pretty.
retrogametech i have a bunch of xbox 360 video games
retrogametech Second, Jokin, Never been this early on A video though.
retrogametech i dont like it. it darkens the image too much.
retrogametech Great video! I like how you show everything closeup and demonstrate the results handson.
retrogametech It looks great on 15kHz 240p stuff, but highresolution 480P games like DOA never had visible scanlines (and neither do Naomi arcade monitors) so the gadget is making it less defined. Look at the bottom of the white garment on DOA (10:02). Theres a 4 pixel slant on the normal VGA output, theres only 2 pixels with the scaline generator as its overwritten every other line of genuine detail with a black line. So the illusion of more detail is actually a reduction in detail by 50.
retrogametech This video kinda kicked me into gear to improve the look of my retro consoles on my flat panel! Ive got an RGBVGA upscaler, and am working on getting a scanline generator. All that remains is for me to figure out how to get RGB out of my NTSC consoles. I see a lot of expensive RGB SCART cable importing in the coming weeks lol
retrogametech Id do the same if I had room for a cab! :P SLG has been one of the best investments in my setup so far! :). Im amazed how good the Wii looks running through one. Its like a different console. Great for the emus!
retrogametech 13:44 Yeah, watch those boobs bounce...WITH MORE DEFINITION! D
retrogametech Looks great. If my Trinitron ever kicks the bucket, Im picking one up.
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech The effect comes across quite well on YouTube. Its encouraging that we will be able to preserve the arcade look long after the CRTs have all died.
retrogametech Agreed. The traditional 2D games like Street Fighter or shooters like Giga Wing definitely benefit.
retrogametech So...what happens if another retro enthusiast has a modem? Could you theoretically have a peer to peer game if someone else had the working hardware?
retrogametech Mega drive MODEM? What in the world do you DO with a modem on the megadrive? I mean what games supported its use?
retrogametech Id also like to know where you got the black QD case?
retrogametech Prank calls on a Mega Drive hell yes.
retrogametech Screw the smart phones! You should use the NGage as you main mobile phone :D I bet it has better batterylife too. Loved those modem dial up sounds. Brings back a lot of memories from the good old BBS days :)
retrogametech So what happens if you answer the phone?
retrogametech dont forget the pencil sharpner and coffee maker attachments complete with there own sega branded power supplies :D
retrogametech The sega mega looks like such a load of crap with all that stuff piled on it. I swear its like sega just couldnt stop piling shit on it.
retrogametech Back in 1990! Crazy :P
retrogametech Mega Modem i remember seeing this on the back of the box from my Jap genesis The Mega Drive looks hideous with all that shit plugged into it though lol
retrogametech It would do that horrible Dial Up screeching sound that used to happen back before broadband.
retrogametech RetroGameTech I know this is off topic and I hope Im not bugging you. I have a 32x that every time I put a genesis game in it it freezes. Im pretty sure its due to the fact the carts dont sit right in the 32x. They have a fair bit of play and can move real easy. Do you know how to fix this?
retrogametech Lol, Im going to pick up a copy of CyberBall and see if I can track down someone who can play a bit of MP xD . Should be fun :)
retrogametech you need fiberoptic mate lol
retrogametech HAHA that is awesome.
retrogametech Now order pizza via GenesisMegaDrive
retrogametech pure AWESOME !! I never new that was around for a mega drive! well dine finding it bro! :)
retrogametech Commercial failure but excellent console and smartphone. Ive just finished collecting a full set of the games. Many of which are excellent and system exclusives. The NGage was aimed at a very different market than that of GBA.
retrogametech pretty crazy, huh? :)
retrogametech Just wondering, did the Mega Drive even have a microphone attachment? I know it was just for fun, but if there was no microphone for it how would it work xD Keep up the good vids!
retrogametech Martin...that is beautiful :) How does the cart work in conjunction with the modem? More info please! Just fantastic too get to see this in action. Thank you and have a great weekend
retrogametech I was hoping a voice would tell you the location of the Dreamcast 2 :D
retrogametech Ill do a full reviewunboxing in the next few weeks :)
retrogametech Sega was ahead of its time. They brought the technology to our living rooms to enjoy the worlds first 16Bit Technology
retrogametech Wow!! Ur megadrive looks like a beast with all those assesorys on it...awsome
retrogametech Excellent response! I lold. If I gave you my number, would you call me via the MD? :D
retrogametech omg the megadrive could go online????
retrogametech What does it do if pick up?
retrogametech No, it was a DREAMCAST in the skip! With Sonic adventure in the drive too!!!
retrogametech wow that megadrive is seriously hooked up. could you plug anything else into it?
retrogametech Youd think there would be anymore addons for the system but Ive still to track down the karaoke attachment!! Best.Console.EVER! :)
retrogametech Thats pretty neat :D Dreamcast was the first to come with a online modem though (EUUS)
retrogametech NGage it an excellent console. You should check it out.
retrogametech :D nice, is there anything the mega drive cannot do?
retrogametech If I call that number I will have called a number the legendary Megadrive called it will be like a celebrity! I am not going to though!
retrogametech Try calling an iPhone with that thing!
retrogametech Maybe. Worth a try. But at a guess (although I have never opened one so I cannot know) I think the megadrive modem would likely have some sort of pain in the arse sega only ROM telling it to take over part of the functionality that would normally be written into a game (like would be written into a PC game). However, after that, in the modem, I bet thered be some standard modem chipset, at which point youd solder in a cable. And then emulate the modem with your pc. In fact, either way do that.
retrogametech awesome dude, greetings from NYC
retrogametech Madness???? This... is... SEGA!
retrogametech Try calling an iPhone with that thing!

retrogametech Nice :) But you might want to block out the number at 1:37
retrogametech awesome dude, greetings from NYC
retrogametech Incredible that you managed to make the Genesis modem work! I cant even manage to get my Dreamcast online for Phantasy Star Online...how can you tell if you have a phone line in your house?
retrogametech Madness???? This... is... SEGA!
retrogametech That would be awesome. There can only be a few titles that are compatable with the MD modem though. I dont know.
retrogametech I was thinking about this a few weeks back. The 9pin serial (EXT) socket on the Megadrive is female unlike the male socket which is typically found on a PC. With a gender changer I wonder if a standard modem or serial to TCPIP connection could be used with games like cyberball.
retrogametech Ive never heard of this module before... do you plan on making a video about it. I would be curious to see what it really was in the day. Seems pretty inovative for the time.
retrogametech Ill do what I can to demo how it would have worked in my review. But basically gameplay would look just the same as if you were playing the CPU with some lag in the menus. Many games that used the modem were of the turnbased type.
retrogametech I would very much like to see you do an unboxing and review of that modem, it looks awesome.
retrogametech Nice, I wonder if you could get the saturn modem working over here in the UK? Ive always wanted to try Duke Nukem  Sega Rally online with the saturn.
retrogametech That would be really cool. I had no idea this even existed I knew about Sega Channel but this is the first time Ive ever seen this modem!
retrogametech Netlink for Saturn still works too. Do you have a Netlink around that you could mess with on camera? Still regret selling it.
retrogametech you must have been bored as hell to come up with this video lol
retrogametech I was going to get one for one of my Mega Drives, just because its a neat lil thing to have. Your Mega Drive needs more addons... like a built in microwave :O
retrogametech I bet it could be done.
retrogametech Yeah it was banned in america because it was a choking hazard.
retrogametech Haha, I actually did use the NGage as my phone until quite recently :P . The battery life is actually really good! Lasts about 67 days in standby as a phone and about 56 hours as console! Haha, lots of memories from when the internet was dialup and pages took minutes to load. When a single MP3 took 1015min to download :P
retrogametech thats just a hoot lol
retrogametech call Microsoft support then just let the magic happen
retrogametech there is a singularity and all sega products are sucked into the black hole left
retrogametech omg that is the most monstrous Mega Drive ive ever seen! lol
retrogametech Yeaa its always good to have some spare SIMs hanging around though my new 02 ones have an expiry date slaps 02 :( I am guessing they will still bring NGages to life after that though :) Is your NGage the one where you talk to the mobile sideways or is that the other version?
retrogametech Now you just need the karaoke add on. :)
retrogametech What happens if you answer?
retrogametech I beleive the saturn had a modem also. I dreamcast was the first to come standard with the console. I was looking to get one of those, is there anything usefull that it can do?
retrogametech hey thanks for uplloading the vids on console repair it gave me the courage to say whats the worst that could happen hurt the plastic and i went and repaired 1 of my ps2s i could nt bring my self to chuck away because it was my first on and it works a charm
retrogametech What phone you have other then the N Gage?
retrogametech it look like your sega is getting gang raped
retrogametech Hehe, whod have though, eh? :P
retrogametech That thing is uber rare! haha. One day maybe. Will also need a bigger entertainment unit to store it all :P
retrogametech HAHahahaha. Calling MEGA DRIVE funniest thing Ive ever seen calling :p nice stuff man.
retrogametech Haha that is absolutely amazing!!!
retrogametech Well that escalated quickly
retrogametech Wow you found a practical use for the NGage. Can the modem be used on the Sega cdx?
retrogametech Did you switch out the lamp that you had in the left for another?
retrogametech Haha, its just an old SIM that came with one of my bundles a while back. It now lives in my NGage since the console cannot be used with a SIM inserted :P
retrogametech Nice vid, very effective :) What car are you driving?
retrogametech DUDE YOURE DRIVING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD!
retrogametech I do not inow for certin but I live in  and we have over 200 cm this year in certain spots.
retrogametech Arrgh, weathers been crappy, it never usually snows this late in the year...
retrogametech Yeah you guys dont classify it as having even snowed unless its several feet deep! :P
retrogametech In the central west we dont really get much. Its a bit too mild down here. It can get heavy at times but then its usually gone again within a day or 2. Compared to the north or colder countries its nothing. Its rare to get genuinely snowed in here :P
retrogametech Reminds me of a track on Richard Burns Rally, very nice roads.
retrogametech dont lie am from glasgow thats summer
retrogametech Beautiful sceenery...thanks for the ride!
retrogametech What a great video. I love all these videos showing off the beauty of Scotland.
retrogametech not because of the roads, lol, because of the snow on the roads
retrogametech What if this road was in england it would have potholes everywhere :)
retrogametech Haha, werent the ice caps supposed to have melted by now? Dont worry, around here the slightest hint of snow and everyone starts driving at 5mph :P .
retrogametech Thats the nice thing about rural roads, no traffic! :)
retrogametech Those damn United Kingdom people driving left P
retrogametech Beautiful sights man! I just moved to New Hampshire from the west of Ireland, and I thought that in the rare occurrence ( ..cuz we normally get fuck all!) that it did snow there, that it was heavy, but its a different world in NH! pure snowed in! how much snow do you get typically in central Scotland?
retrogametech Where is this , I know its Scotland ( Im from strathaven) so ill probably known where this is.
retrogametech Curious... What ya driving in this?
retrogametech Its beautiful out there, also nice driving.
retrogametech Oh, wow, that is beautiful. I could drive around there for hours, Im sure. I was uncomfortable throughout the video though, hahah, because in the back of my mind I was sure youd die at any moment. Im really not used to seeing things from that side of the road.
retrogametech Great vid, great road :)
retrogametech Ive never been but the Peak District looks great for driving. Twisty roads and dramatic scenery FTW!
retrogametech I really enjoy these videos of yours. What mount do you use for the Flip cam, and would you recommend it?
retrogametech is this sped up? or are you hauling ass
retrogametech Funny... The last few days in winter where great!
retrogametech How is that, sir, risky? Try roads in Latvia for example...
retrogametech Thanks for the reply man! For a geezer thats from UK  Ireland I dont know much about Scotland lol! Love the Vids man, epic stuff
retrogametech I could do it ) Martins Outrun 2013.....
retrogametech ha should of seen the weather in mold flintshire wales that week
retrogametech Where are the check points lol
retrogametech Not the one Im using, no. The suction mount does a nice job of keeping the camera steady although it still suffers from some vibration. I found that speeding up footage 2x and rendering at 60fps does a good job of disguising camera shake :)
retrogametech Nice, Looked a bit faster than the National speed limit.
retrogametech We are still having snow in Norway too.
retrogametech easy left, easy right, jump Sega Rally Championship:)
retrogametech Its meant to snow here tonight  tomorrow (Liverpool), it has been getting colder over the past few days
retrogametech In Ayrshire its just grey and no snow..
retrogametech Eyup, its March and I cant always get to Dundee because of the roads :(
retrogametech Ahh good old Scotish weather, pretty much the same over here too LOL. Cool video matey :)
retrogametech You should have had Magical SNOW Shower playing on the vid.
retrogametech The footage was pretty steady during this, does the flip have image stabilization?
retrogametech Sod getting in a car with you, I dont like being on that road when its dry and sunny!!
retrogametech Looks like most of my early morning drives to work. I use both sides of the road.
retrogametech Love the music. Compared to Rhode Island, Scotland looks like a cool place to live.
retrogametech The music is from the 2006 version of OutRun Coast 2 Coast :) . Its OK living here but 80 of the time the weather is uninspiring and miserable.
retrogametech Time for me to turn on my xbox live and play a outrun playthrough now
retrogametech Its a lot of fun to drive out there. Even better in the snow :)
retrogametech Thats a lovely drive youve got there. Even in the US, we are getting crazy weather like that. Supposedly snowed somewhere here in Arkansas the other day.
retrogametech Haha, good to hear from you, sir! :) I suppose it at least makes a nice change from the constant rain!
retrogametech LOL. Your driving on the wrong side of the road :D
retrogametech Someone should edit it with a Out Run hud and sounds. we need Checkpoints!!111 ,)
retrogametech Instead of doing a mute footage you could coment while driving or afterwards in the edition, nonetheless cool video showing us the beatifull Scotland. Greetings from Portugal!
retrogametech Ugh... Your country has bad draw distance.
retrogametech Why cant there be an outrun game like this. Ill buy it ). As always great video.
retrogametech getting snow in march, you sound shocked we live in scotland its always snowingraininghailwindy basically everything except sunny lol
retrogametech The snow was hellish bad up here in Stonehaven also, nice vid
retrogametech Movie maker can double a cars engine and handling performance )
retrogametech I might do something like this in future for video responsestalkies etc :)
retrogametech RetroGameTech If only! Ive got plenty of assignments to keep me busy :(
retrogametech Great vid! Here in Toronto, just when we thought winter was over we got a few centimeters of snow.
retrogametech Know this road well, think you must live near to me.
retrogametech Man Im so jealous of people who get snow. Looks like an amazing drive.
retrogametech The forest drive at the beginning reminded me of northern Ontario. Not as much forest where live. Great video!
retrogametech Why have you speeded the footage up?
retrogametech My in Scotland thats bad try Montana )
retrogametech Cool vid. It looked you were diving in some of the corners Mansell ) What car were you driving may I ask?
retrogametech PEI just got hit with a big snowstorm, schools cancelled and everything
retrogametech What a brilliant road. I have to get out into the Peak District to find anything like that, which is quite a trip.
retrogametech Misses the Ferrari car sound to add more excitement :)
retrogametech Its not. The title is a play on words. The track featured in the video is called Risky Ride. Its from the driving game OutRun 2006.
retrogametech How much snow do you guys typically get around this time of year?
retrogametech He would have made a killing back in the RROD days.
retrogametech It usually always that same top ribbon cable, Fix quite a few of them, just by reseating the cables .
retrogametech Hah you fixed it then traded it in at GAME!
retrogametech wow you must really no what your doing to try this lucky all three of my 3dss work fine wow good on you
retrogametech Holy crap, this is BRILLIANT! I should try this one day.
retrogametech dude u sound exactly like Timothy V. Murphy :D
retrogametech And it does not even turn on is it just the ribbon cables and am I just being a complete fucking moron
retrogametech Hi RetroGameTech, I would like to ask if it is possible to reseat the ribbon cables just by unscrewing the top screen? I dont wish to mess with the motherboard at the bottom screen
retrogametech Can you make a video of fixing this problem?Both my 3ds have the same problem and I really need to learn how to fix.
retrogametech this lime green ds is beautifull
retrogametech Ha I won a Broken Xbox off eBay, for 10 AUD and it actually worked! Bit of a sticky drive, but it came complete with 20GB hard drive, WiFi adapter and power supply. It was a 2009 model so it came with HDMI and because it was Arcade there was an extra 500MB built in  the 20GB hard drive included. Found a spare HDMI lead lying around and boom I had a 2nd 360 in my house, now lives in my study and is mostly used for Chat and FIFA and my other one is a 20072011 (2007 model RRODd in early 2012 so on its age must check) model and is used for all my media and the occasional Spit Screen party with mates. SCORE
retrogametech The ebay seller was from doncaster near me :) great vids
retrogametech I got a metalic blue for chrismis (Forgot how to spell) And the whole thing inside was smashed and i just got it. Atleast i got a metalic red for a free refund.
retrogametech My screen sometimes goes darker sometimes though what is it
retrogametech RetroGameTech Was kindly donated a red 3DS in reasonable condition minus the fact the touch screen is broken, I was curious though what is the average price they sell for on AmazonEbay?
retrogametech XD THANKS FOR TELLING ME U ROCK but I cant take it apart! (
retrogametech My buttons and my touch screen wont respond. And I have never spilled any liquids on my 3ds XL and I have a case to prevent damage if it fell. Anyone know what the problem could be?
retrogametech My son spilt milk on hes 3ds the A button doesnt any ideas I took it apart and cleaned the contacts but same result?? The button still feels stiffer than usual
retrogametech i got a 3ds with a faulty charger port, replaced that and its good as new....was going to sell it but cant stop playing it now :( btw have you heard of a gb boy colour?
retrogametech Please god help me fix my R trigger :(
retrogametech It might be where you are. Around here(still in the USA), all the game stores will offer cash. Of course, the trade in value they offer is higher since they arent exactly handing you real money.
retrogametech Thanks. Theyre great little consoles. You can pick them up reasonably cheap now :)
retrogametech Im going to start listing all of my values in pesos from now on.
retrogametech He didnt get a refund, he traded it in, or sold it to the game store.
retrogametech i have a canon ixus 220 hs, i bought it for either 150 or 250 but i was shooting an outdoor scene i tripped and fell on the grass and the lens is bent, ill sell it to you if you want. it has a great slow motion feature. used it goes for around 80  90 so if you do get it itd be a great deal on your part. interested?
retrogametech Can you make a video on how to replace a 3DS shell? I plan on doing a replacement but, Im not sure how to do so
retrogametech Ah so you Scottsmen have different notes to us Englishmen I assumed we all had the same notes because we all use GBP. Learn something new everyday :D
retrogametech The last question sorry ihave capacitor new one same the old but new can i change the exploding one with the new
retrogametech I need to know... Youve called this your hobby, but it seems like you make a lot of cash doing it. Are you one of those supersellers on eBay or do you have a day job?
retrogametech the backlight of my touch screen is not working on my 3ds, it works perfectly fine if you apply pressure to the bottom left of the screen. any suggestions?
retrogametech It can be a bit of a gamble with the cosmetic condition of these systems but sometimes you get lucky and it pays off :)
retrogametech If I had your skill...
retrogametech I wish! haha Right now Im just trying to keep my overdraft in check :P Same here. Not many of the new games have interested me. There are a few on the eShop that look cool but I cant justify Nintendos asking prices. That new Luigis Mansion game looks cool, though! Do you think youll ever upgrade to the XL?
retrogametech Thats a pretty nice profit! Good find :)
retrogametech get a rubber band put it on the stripped screw and twist that bitch!
retrogametech Absolutely love the show, keep up the great work.
retrogametech My friend sold a brandnew 3DS at gamestop and he got 40 back  your gamestop sounds like heaven!
retrogametech where did you learn how to repair stuff?
retrogametech can i buy one of the ds lites?
retrogametech Well I kinda got lucky on this one I think :P . Normally they sell for a bit more.
retrogametech Absolutely love the show, keep up the great work.
retrogametech My friend sold a brandnew 3DS at gamestop and he got 40 back  your gamestop sounds like heaven!
retrogametech where did you learn how to repair stuff?
retrogametech can i buy one of the ds lites?
retrogametech well done for keeping it out of landfill
retrogametech These videos are like forensics with game consoles.
retrogametech You are fully of surprises lol.
retrogametech Which cable was it actually?
retrogametech Buy some faulty old systems to mess around with and learn as you go :) . Most of what youll need to know can be found here on YouTube or on forums.
retrogametech lmao how did it fall in the sea hahahahaha?
retrogametech i have the same problem can you tell me which ribbon you moved because i replaced the top screen and the speakers, still having the same problem
retrogametech Excellent easy repair! I bet it took a while to diagnose it though.
retrogametech oh and i got the 3ds for 30 delivered :D
retrogametech Another great video man. Got me thinking though, I bought a Legend of Zelda 3DS a while back but it was missing the interior box (the cardboard tray everything sits in), any idea where on Earth Id find a replacement?
retrogametech you done an amazing job to all the consoles you have fixed i am impressed :) i subscribed :D
retrogametech how much for the ds lites?
retrogametech Oh god, the gymnastics required to handle the two in the DSi XL was enough to drive me nuts. I have a few DS Lite repairs coming up and I was relieved to find that they also have one ribbon and a bit more room to route it.
retrogametech Dat profile picture...
retrogametech Heya, Anyone heard about the Rapid Cash Fortune? (do a Google Search) Ive found out quite a few wonderful stuff about it and my uncle made loads of money with it!
retrogametech I hate taking apart the 3DS. Those ribbon cables are such a pain to get seated properly. Managed to make a working one from 2 broken ones from ebay (one had been dipped in a cup of tea and the other had a smashed top screen) and have another broken one in my drawer that fell in the sea that I hope to fix. I already cleaned all the salt out of it and cleaned the contacts with isopropyl but am waiting for a charger to arrive from Ebay.
retrogametech Need urgent answer! If you encounter a stripped screw of these size how would you go about removing them, the previous owner of mine did a number on them and have the exact problem as you with the 3ds
retrogametech Nice one, very clever!
retrogametech I paid 43 for a 3ds and 20 for a display. I have fixed it and sold it for 104
retrogametech I was looking at getting one to use as a sorta throw away DS to carry round with me, as my Gold Zelda one is my precious and I dont want it getting all scratched up lol!
retrogametech Tbh I was a little surprised they offered me so much in cash. The store credit was only marginally better at 80 so it was a no brainer to go the cash option :) Glad the other vid helped! :)
retrogametech Wow! You have a pretty great monitor!
retrogametech In a Scottish accent: Thenks fuhr teking the tame to meking us these veedeohs
retrogametech Im not sure what you mean by they? The majority of people around the world either use or are familiar with the value of US Dollars in comparison to their native currency. On top of that, over 80 of my viewers are from the US. Only a very small percentage are actually from ScotlandUK. I think it makes a lot of sense to add USD values so everyone can get a better idea of the prices Ive paid.
retrogametech I dont know why but I LOVE your vids man, good job with this one...
retrogametech 01:00 Looks like you got an extra 1x Styles with your purchase too! What a nice guy!
retrogametech That box is huge! My NTSC box is half that size!
retrogametech damn if the guy who sold this watched this, hed be pissed lol
retrogametech Haha, I suppose thats one way of looking at it. Thankfully there were no unidentified bodily fluids or stains to deal with on this one! :P
retrogametech You should get one of these things. Fix it. Return it to the seller for a refund. Put a note in the box saying that you fixed it, and for them to enjoy their once broken hardware. They will be so surprised and grateful. You would REALLY make someones day.
retrogametech You money is worth a lot more than here in the US
retrogametech The guy that sold this will be watching and saying you jammy fcking twt hehe
retrogametech Got to love the new Scottish money :D Us English still have boring money
retrogametech Yeah, another video from RetroGameTech! You made my day!
retrogametech Whats the name of that green layer you use on your desk?
retrogametech Help not working this my 3ds
retrogametech best part about ngage was that you could ran the games on any symbian phone without jailbreakingrootingwhatever your phone :)
retrogametech I also have a complete NGage collection including the full download of Payload, a dl only game which cost, I think, GBP14 to get the serial number to unlock the game fully.
retrogametech Great collection, well done mate. Im a fellow collector, who has begun collecting 5 years after selling on an almost entire collection of games, prerelease demos and other swag. Finding it incredibly different now to collect again. One question, where did you get the black QD fascia? Id love one of those.
retrogametech i loved you videos so much i bought an ngage qd on ebay. now im waiting for it to arrive, can you please do a top 10 or top 5 (whatever you like) games so i know what to get in time for the consoles arrival. also, is there any accesories you have that would go with it well.
retrogametech You wouldnt happen to have an extra copy of Atari Masterpieces II would you? Its the only game left I dont have. Ive got some gold master review kits  orange beta cards if youre interested in trading for that kind of stuff.
retrogametech Ashen is easily the best looking game on NGage, looks abit like the original quake.
retrogametech Bootleg NGage games, no, but that doesnt mean they werent pirated, given the nature of the storage format, you can just buy your own MMC card and stick on as many as you can fit. When I had my NGage, I couldnt find many retail games so while I did have a few legit games in my collection, most were loaded on that way. It did of course mean that more than one game could be loaded on at a time and with the need to remove the battery to switch out games this was more convenient.
retrogametech i have a ngage bag that i got in 2005 :D, i still got my ngage i love that phone its a beast!
retrogametech put ur channel back to normal!!!
retrogametech can somewone write down all of the games here in a comment so i can download them to my 6630? Yes, i still have one :D
retrogametech the Tiger Woods game originally came from Argos........the 7 digit order number on the front gives it away lol
retrogametech dud, good clolection, but you still dont have all of them. There were 77 games made. My favrite is Civialization and Myst.
retrogametech Would love to see some gameplay on what you would consider the best game graphically, really interested in what the NGage could do!
retrogametech What is the 98 day countdown timer counting down to?
retrogametech isnt there a Sims game for the ngage?
retrogametech Congratulations Martin! Must feel great to finally track down that final game, well done! :D
retrogametech 2:22  10:17 Youve been recording it for 12 days?
retrogametech Not for the original NGage gamephone. Nokia kept and continued to use the NGage brand for its mobile games long after the Taco and QD were discontinued. It would most likely be a download only game released for one of their later smartphones.
retrogametech Thanks. Yeah it can be difficult explaining the logic (or lack there of!) behind owningcollecting sealed games :P Good luck with the Sonic collection. You should do a video on it!
retrogametech Its one of my favourites so Ill try and do a vid some time soon :)
retrogametech Haha, could you guess I was kinda tired when I recorded that segment :P
retrogametech the collection is cool! do you still have it?
retrogametech That times, when phone was game console  its so damn priceless. Even NGage was screwed because of GBA and technical issues, its still looks more solid than whole IOS and Google Play Market.
retrogametech It was definitely a very odd design decision. Im surprised the idea made it past the concept stages let alone into the final product! Maybe it really was a genuine oversight? But how could they miss it!? You effectively had to disassemble half the phone then rebootreset clock and calendar settings every time you wanted to play a new game! lol The QD is nice but they dropped some hardware features like the MP3 player, radio and microphone port. Although screen is biggerbrighter as a bonus :)
retrogametech Could you make video about the top 5 games?
retrogametech That NGage countdown timer is a very strange item to own indeed. Where did you get that from?
retrogametech I myself am trying to get hold of a boxed console. You got any spare lol
retrogametech wow i didnt even know it had so many games
retrogametech I really wanna see the sims bustin out on ngage! :D
retrogametech Whats your favourite, Ashen will always have a place in my heart. I loved it back in 20034 on my long trips to school, classic style fps.
retrogametech could you tell us how much you gave for civilization and sega rally and maybe tell us a bit about how you got them, maybe some in the past that you almost got or were outbid? the part of collecting that i like is the stories that go along with it. the stories are quite possibly as good as the item itself! thanks for posting. im pleased to see that you found all of them. when you made the video looking for civilization, i looked on the web periodically to help but no avail.
retrogametech Same here, charged up the QD and started playing some of my old games :) . Dual MMC slot? That sounds interesting! Ive never seen one of those. It depends what type of games youre into but theres at least one good title in each genre.
retrogametech Collin mcrea rally 2005
retrogametech congrats on completing the collection! id love to see gameplay from xandu next and requim of hell
retrogametech Very nice milestone  I am missing 7 ( Atari 1  2  civilization  High seize  warhammer  rifts and of course sega rally, I remember when this one was 20 pounds  delivery from AUS but I said pass, now I am regretting it a little)
retrogametech Ngage is in Tate mode?
retrogametech Congrats Man! Ive Been Contemplating Starting A Complete Gamecube Collection.
retrogametech also would like to see gameplay for anyone honestly, especially ones that use a lot of 3d graphics as opposed to 2d.
retrogametech great work on collecting them all, could you maybe do a vid with your top 5 best games  top 5 worst games???  i love to see sega rally! love that game  would also love to see it shat out the arse of the ngage P

retrogametech Ngage is in Tate mode?
retrogametech wow never knew xanadu next was released, from what it looked like it felt like a beta version
retrogametech Now we all know that the NGage was a garbage phone and gaming system but that is an absolutely incredible collection. Hats off to you, sir. Congratulations
retrogametech also would like to see gameplay for anyone honestly, especially ones that use a lot of 3d graphics as opposed to 2d.
retrogametech great work on collecting them all, could you maybe do a vid with your top 5 best games  top 5 worst games???  i love to see sega rally! love that game  would also love to see it shat out the arse of the ngage P
retrogametech Wow, talk about playing on the go now haha.
retrogametech Ive never played an NGage but to see a complete collection is really cool. A few questions: could you still get an NGage activated on a wireless plan and use it as a phone? Are you planning on getting all the games sealed too? Can you do some gameplay footage of Sonic N? I love Sonic games but Ive never seen that one...
retrogametech Thanks. Ive not seen an NGage game in the wild for years!
retrogametech Were you being a complete jerk?
retrogametech Okay now I want one. Been thinking about it for a while but now I definitely have to get one for my collection.
retrogametech Do you know how to use Gentoo? I am going crazy.
retrogametech Thanks. Yeah theres definitely some stinkers in there. It should be fun to do a few vids on them :)
retrogametech do some call of duty n gage gameplay
retrogametech Thanks for the suggestion :) . Im probably going to do something along those lines.
retrogametech Well thanks for watching and taking the time to comment :)
retrogametech I wanna see ngage gameplay
retrogametech Can you still play these online?
retrogametech grats man Im inspired , maybe Ill try to get full collection of Virtual Boy
retrogametech Sorry man, may i ask you why you blocked me in my other channel TheCompleteJerk ? :(
retrogametech search images ngage qd accessories in google and you will see the dual slot.. theres alot of rare ones like the speaker and the wired headset..
retrogametech seriously, i didnt do anything
retrogametech Do you use an NGage as your actual phone?
retrogametech Ah damn! Sega Rally. A friend of mine found one here for 3 I think at the time he didnt know it was rare, sealed and everything. Talk about luck there. Really happy for you, that youve completed the collection! Such a forgotten system, I rather like it to be honest. Anyway man, congratulations :)
retrogametech Once again, thanks for the great video and I hope you enjoy your complete collection :) Well done!
retrogametech Im curious to know, how much was your entire collection?
retrogametech Thanks. Out of all the original Ngage games, only 55 were ever released as hardware copies that you could buy in stores. The rest were either download only or unreleasedunfinished betas. Thats why it might appear Im missing some titles. But the download only games can still be obtained and played if you search the internet ) .
retrogametech When Gamestop was closing down here in the UK, they had 3 NGage games all for 1P each. One was that Tomb Raider game, that Diablo style game and something else, i ended up selling them all for 10 each lol. Also Is there any good NGage emulators? I see some about, but because theyre not talked about a lot I dont trust their validity.
retrogametech This is awesome. Well done. I am moving to Scotland soon ( Uni ), I would be honoured to visit your game room.
retrogametech congrats mate, your vids are great :)
retrogametech Thats a pretty big task! Good luck! :)
retrogametech The price of the system seems to fluctuate quite a bit. between 1550 depending on modelcondition etc. The most expensive Ive seen a game sell for was a factory sealed copy of SEGA Rally. It went for 400 USD back in 2012. Crazy!
retrogametech I still use my NGage QD but I have only one or two games (somewhere!) Can you recommend any good sources for memory cards so I can emulate them instead please?
retrogametech Could you do a gameplay for tomb raider
retrogametech Id like to see gameplay for the rifts game. I hear its based on the old pen and paper game.
retrogametech How much does an ngage roughly cost?
retrogametech I love your explanation at the end, there. People ask me why I collect games and keep some of them sealed and they cant understand it. Im trying to achieve a full Sonic PAL CiB collection which is starting to take up a lot of room, but I think itll be worth it in the end. Love your collection and pickup videos reminds me Im not the only one. Haha
retrogametech The cards look like the ps vita game cards
retrogametech A complete NGage collection!!! Its awesome!!! Congratulations! Now you can start reviewing some of this games, maybe foucusing on the exclusives. I played some of the early games like Tomb Raider (great port), Sonic N (an poor port of Sonic Advance) and Super Monkey Ball (another poor port from the GBA) but I never manage to play the exclusives :(
retrogametech A white board... Pretty different to bog standard one
retrogametech Its xbox one joysticks
retrogametech I love the thumbsticks but my fps FREEKS elite I have them on
retrogametech FREEKS fuck you autocorrect
retrogametech OMG I HAVE THAT CONTROLler my thumbsticks are a bit broke from my fps Greeks but there ok
retrogametech any hints on how to fix thumbstick controller drift? my halo 4 controllers left stick is walking to the right, and my halo reach controller is pulling to the front too :(.
retrogametech I did get this controller when i preeordered halo 4 (i could choose between a controller or a headset) and i like it. Its nice to just have it too :D
retrogametech Unlike a boss, my 360 controller got rusty because I dont play it much so the batteries leaked! It doesnt work anymore even with other battery boxes. Easy to fix or is it time for me to seek a wired controller?
retrogametech I know this is asking a lot but can you do a really quick vid so I know what I need to do to the bumpers
retrogametech That was the best thing that they ever did to it! But to be honest I do prefer the old analogs.
retrogametech Where did you find this I want to buy it
retrogametech Wish the Star Wars 360 controller had a blue light. Like the console.
retrogametech I actually specifically swapped the sticks for the two controllers, The original xbox ones are tighter but they both fit in the opposite controller.
retrogametech Hey Cool video, I have the same halo 4 controllers and limited edition 360 on my channel. I show a video of me putting my modsticks into it. Plz check it out btw I subbed your channel!
retrogametech I have this got for Christmas
retrogametech The dpad isnt standard either btw not trying to criticize your video but the default dpads have 2 screws you have to use and look much different than the dpad design with this control where u can simply rotate 90 degrees and pop it out
retrogametech Or as I like to call it, Salty Chew. actually made myself a little ill there
retrogametech Definitely invest in a wired controler but you CAN clean out the dried battery acid if youre careful and do it right.
retrogametech At least theres not a couple decades worth of congealed sweat and grim to deal with! :P
retrogametech Really bad idea IMO. Also, good luck maneuvering that molten plastic biro down the deep and very narrow holes in your expensive LE controller :P. Much easiersafer just to by the correct tool for a . Failing that just use the technique I mentioned using a precision screwdriver. The melted biro method only really works for game carts where the screw is easily accessible. And even then its likely going to damage your cart. Not to mention the fumes and dangers of handling hot molten plastic!
retrogametech I made a very simple mod to my Wavebird the other day. Ive never like the CStick on the Gamecube pads  my thumb always slipped off because the top of the stick was so small  Ive always felt it would be better if was the same as the left stick. This is particularly true when playing an FPS on the Gamecube (or on the Wii with a GC pad). All I did was remove the Cstick from the Wavebird  swapped it out for the left stick of a cheap 3rd party pad from W. Et voila  better Cstick.
retrogametech Ive done similar mods to some thord party Original Xbox pads. Swapping the horrible cheapo sticks with some official ones.
retrogametech great video nice looking controller.
retrogametech Awsome mod bro..keep up the great vids!
retrogametech I have the 2 controllers that came with my Halo 4 360, different design and the clear shell is blue instead of grey. Im not too bothered by the analogue sticks in them but Id definitely be interested in getting a replacement sticks for my spare old white controller. They are pretty worn and youve shown its pretty easy to swap out.
retrogametech I bought a new black wired controller a while back as my white wireless pads got years back are fucked .but with the new thumbsticks on the xbox controller now just fell different to me not the same smooth rubber as the old controllers .new controllers just fell more cheaply made to so just watching your vid and trying to switch round the thumbsticks.
retrogametech thanks for making this vid. i just fixed my dpad :D
retrogametech I might upgrade From my old controller to one of these.
retrogametech i found someone on ebay selling them ebay.co.ukitmXbox360TransformingDPadREDCHROME261176934168?ptUKControllersAttachmentshashitem3ccf5bbf18
retrogametech good to know. Ill need to do this for one of my controllers but for less of a mod and more of the old sticks grips are fading
retrogametech Ive seen people heat the end of a biro with a cigarette lighter then push that into the screw hole as a temporary screw bit too.
retrogametech I thought you were about to play a tune on the battery terminals.
retrogametech any idears where i can get one of them dpads from ! Sooo Sick ! would be even better if i can get it in Red Chrome ! URGH
retrogametech Nice controller, Ive got a couple of special edition controllers ( street fighter, call of duty etc.) would be great if you made a vid on how to replace the LEDs for blue ones, I trust your guides so I would just follow yours. :)
retrogametech like a boss. i had a mare takin a 360 controller apart.. well the putting it back together bit was where i had trouble cos the shoulder button bit was snapped. i have a thumbstick that coasts to the left after youve let go of it.. is this somethin that could be fixed by just replacing the stick or do you think its a deeper problem with the innards?
retrogametech Does anyone know what kind of thumb sticks the Halo 4 controller has? Im looking for them in red. I prefer it better than the original thumb sticks. Help please!! D:
retrogametech Ive been building and customizing 360 controllers for a few years now. Ive never seen an aftermarket casekit or controller that even came close to the quality of official Microsoft stuff. The build quality and feel are never quite right. With controllers youre always best sticking to official OEM.
retrogametech It might just need reseated. But it could also mean the stick mechanism underneath has worn out. Its kinda difficult to say without taking a look. Controllers can be a real pain in the balls sometimes. The slightest bit of wear in any one of the buttons can throw the whole feel of the pad off. Sometimes its best just to replace the whole thing and save yourself the headache :P
retrogametech But thats the magic of old consoles! New ones arent as fun :(
retrogametech Hey man, Ive been watching your videos for some time. Always looking forward to an upload from you! Anyways Ive been wondering, where do you go to buy all your consoles and games? Do you just use Ebay? Ive been wanting to get into fixing up consoles, and youve helped motivate that for me! So thanks!
retrogametech Can I have you joysticks mine are wearing out
retrogametech Do you think you could make a video on modifying the PS3 controllers LEDs to change their color? Its probably fairly easy to do, but Id like to see you do it. Perhaps even adding an LED to the PS Button so it has like a glow effect to it. Just throwing ideas out. :)
retrogametech So much simpler than a ps3 controller
retrogametech also, are those the same size as a gamecubes left analog stick?
retrogametech Online from GAME. Amazon sell them as well from what I can see.
retrogametech Look killer, mate! Original Xbox DPads were CRAP!
retrogametech Also I think they left the battery pack black because it hides the stickers and other junk hiding under it.
retrogametech dont they make aftermarket clear controller cases? why not just leave that one alone and make the controller of your dreams?
retrogametech you know how to take the limited edition halo 4 controller mine fell on the ground and this caused the left bumper to go downward and stick it still is half way popped up and I can press it the only problem is I want it the way it was if I take it apart like you did can I adjust the spring or is the spring going to need to be replaced
retrogametech Man those 360 controllers are a bit more busy inside than the MegaDrive and SNES ones Im used to :D
retrogametech They are inside limited edition PAX controllers I believe.
retrogametech Hey Martin, would you happen to know if the original XBox controllers use the same thumbsticks as the 360? I have an old XBox controller with some really worn sticks, but while I can find plenty of replacements for the 360, I havent been able to find any specifically for the original XBox.
retrogametech They used white LEDs to get a light blue color?
retrogametech Thanks. Good to hear you got it running again but just remember thats an extremely temporary fix :P
retrogametech Games looks great for how old it is.
retrogametech I mentioned some of the differences in the video description and I think theres an online wiki about it on the fan site :) . And yes, Kasumi is full frontal neked in the Japanese LE intro :P . Well, shes in some sort of water bubble thing but you can see everything ahem.
retrogametech one of the best DOA game, one of the best fighting game and one of the best dreamcast game as well! full of win. thx for sharing
retrogametech is an amazing looking game even now, and is probably one of the best games for 2 players, huge fun i remember having with DOA 2 when the Dreamcast was new.
retrogametech I was playing the 3DS version last night, it definitely seems very similar to this. I made a 3DS from parts of broken ones I bought on eBay after being inspired by your lets repair videos :)
retrogametech Yes, most of the stages are multiteared. I think a few of them have 3 tiers in various directionspaths. Its a very cool feature. Sadly I wasnt playing long enough to show them off here.
retrogametech if i wasnt such a lazy bastard i would so learn japanese.. definitely the coolest sounding language on earth.. even if they cant say r  this game really shows what the DC can do.. and it makes most other devs look lazy by comparison.. its a shame the console never had a full lifespan.. i think we would have seen some amazing stuff come out on it.. aaah sega, where did it all go wrong?
retrogametech Nice, this the import version? This is the first game I purchased when I bought my Dreamcast, from what I remember I had to buy an under the counter bootdisk to play it. Ive played it since on the xbox and the english voice overs just sound wrong :(
retrogametech The Dreamcast was WAY ahead of its time. Still looking great, well into the new millennium.
retrogametech Ive always found the Street Fighter games a little too technical for me (I suck at them!). You really need to spend a lot of time with them to get anywhere. With DoA I find it a lot more accessible and fun.
retrogametech cant find this game :(
retrogametech such an easy game but it is good fun.
retrogametech DOA 2 LE was like the best for the Dreamcast... I really had fun with my friend when i played this, although I lost my skill and he won 255, ouch!!
retrogametech Brilliant game thats for sure :)
retrogametech Hey Martin, Ive been meaning to get a scanline generator, for the sake of 16bit games played through Dreamcasts early console emulation. I understand the need for scanlines for early games played on HD sets. But I see you recommending the scanline generator for the already high def DOA2... Does the use of scanlines in addition to VGA further enhance DOA2 beyond the HD image that VGA provides?
retrogametech Wow your VGA hookup is beautiful. I cant wait till I finally get some time to mod mine
retrogametech I still love this game, this was fun to watch Martin. tengu always gave a hard time, hate that guy...lol
retrogametech Thanks Luke! Thats what I was aiming for so Im glad the vid came across in that way and you enjoyed it :) . Haha, I was genuinely surprised Tengu didnt put up more of a fight! Usually he hands me my ass a good 4 or 5 times before I finally beat the game. I think I got lucky! haha Thanks for watching!
retrogametech I remember playing this on my dreamcast. This version is faster and cleaner then the original. If anyone can get their hands on it. Never let it go
retrogametech Its one of those game like Streets Of Rage where I never seem to get tired of playing it. Weirdly satisfying :)
retrogametech very nice man! also I wanted to tell you my step brother had a red ringed xbox and we tried what you did just unplugged the fan and waited and it works now!
retrogametech Loved this game for Dreamcast. Can you kick your opponent through the round window in the first stage? I thought this game had some multiteared stages.
retrogametech Thanks dude! Glad you enjoyed it. I know you have some high standards for LP vids. Happy to have gained your approval :P
retrogametech Cool vid mate. Re the SLG 3000, can it take multiple inputs or only one at a time? Im interested in one but do not want the hassle of switching between consoles when using it. Thanks
retrogametech EVERYTHING IS MY DELUSION!
retrogametech Wow, that was a fast game. I didnt realize that was a TECMO game, no wonder you like it.
retrogametech Always been more of a Tekken fan myself, although I do enjoy a bit of DOA. Never really enjoyed the Street Fighter series
retrogametech I agree. The DC version does look better, and runs at a silkysmooth 60fps.
retrogametech Youre missing out! :P
retrogametech Haha, yeah its the Japanese version. I cant take the English voice acting on the others :P . Its nice they give you the option on later games to choose which you prefer.
retrogametech Me and my friend joked about fighting games. We said Dead Or Alive was on the leading edge of Jiggle Physics and was a fighting game second. We were Street Fighter nerds. However sense I started playing DoAD for the 3ds I have taken a liking to the series. It lacks that street fighter feel, but it has an unbelievable polish.
retrogametech Whats your opinion on Dead or Alive 2 Ultimate for Xbox? What do you think of the modern Ninja Gaiden games, since they share a connection?
retrogametech Ignore last question, I just looked at the info.
retrogametech Its a good game but probably not. I find the 3D Sonic games on DC pretty difficult to control!
retrogametech The Ls Castle stage is amazing, really huge. Shame it was not revived in DOAD and DOA5U.
retrogametech How about Tekken series? Especially third (my favourite) on PlayStation? I never played DoA, I think i must test it out on my PSOne.
retrogametech Graphics still hold up really well
retrogametech i want to play my dreamcast now!
retrogametech ..using the SLG. Im really interested to see how Mega Drive emulation will look when combined with SLG and the Dreamcasts VGA 480p output. Will test it out soon! Im going to try and make a video about my thoughts on the issue in the coming weeks. So far I really like the SLG3000 but only when used with the DC and with the scan line intensity set VERY low.
retrogametech Never a let down with your videos. Good man.
retrogametech I still have this game, but the disc doesnt work anymore. Well, not this exact version, I have the NA release. My friend had (probably still has) DOA2: Hardcore for PS2, and whenever we got together, wed challenge each other. I preferred HayateEin, while he went with Ayane.The bonus features that the PS2 version had were image galleries with the same images as the Dreamcast version had when you put the disc in a PC. I dont know if it maybe had more outfits. I unlocked them all on my game.
retrogametech I find it hard just to discern individual words let alone understand the language! It seems hella complicated. Would be very cool to be able to speak it though :) Who knows where the Dreamcast would have ended up had SEGA not had to call it quits. Its probably for the best though. They went out on a proper high. Better than crashing and burning in disgrace :)
retrogametech I do have a capture card thing but I dont like using it. I think they give a less personal feel to these type of videos. Theyre also a lot more work to use (extra editing, capturing voice audio, equipment to set up etc).
retrogametech I have been hoping for you to do something like this for a long time.
retrogametech wtf? they graphics are cracking for a 90s console why do i not remember them as this?
retrogametech I still have this game. Loved it back in the day. Not as good as Soul Calibre but great game. Graphics still look good now, but back then it was stunning as were most Dreamcast games.
retrogametech They did a great job on the graphics with this series. DoA3 on oriinal Xbox looks like it could actually be a 360 title. The best part is the gameplay didnt suffer because of the pretty visuals.
retrogametech I actually prefer this style of vid to using a capture device. More personal and much easier to shooteditupload :P
retrogametech One of my favourites :)
retrogametech Not so much high standards, more just genuine effort and thought ) I dont even like the DoA games but you made this entertaining to watch so that makes it a success to me!
retrogametech I think i have the Xbox DOA collection I think. I might have to dig it out and play it.
retrogametech Not sure but the Dreamcast wasnt far off the PS2 in terms of performance. It actually looks a lot better in many circumstances.
retrogametech Thanks, I appreciate that :)
retrogametech congratulations on your 200th video!
retrogametech My favourite two youtubers :) Martin and Lukemorse!
retrogametech Thanks for watching :) . I think this one and the 3DS versions are the best. Ive not played the 5th one much yet but from what Ive seen its brilliant, too.
retrogametech Haha. Im playing though the Dreamcast VGA cable which does 480p. Very sharp image and the colours really pop, looks absolutely brilliant. I also run it through an SLG 3000 (scan line generator) which uses magic to give the image horizontal scan lines as if it were an old CRT monitor. The real world effect of this is to give the illusion of adding extra definition to the graphics.
retrogametech Are you going to play Sonic Adventure next!?!?
retrogametech The SLG does appear to give the illusion of adding extra definition to almost all Dreamcast games. For example JSR, DoA, MSR and Daytona all look better despite not being typical 2D sprite based games. They look amazing over VGA anyway but the SLG just gives a little extra definition. But, I think its all down to personal preferencesetups. I didnt like the results of SLG  SaturnMega Drive. I prefer a clean, sharp and unaltered image on those. Ive still to test some SEGA emus on the DC..
retrogametech The Dreamcast really was mind blowingly impressive when it came out. I couldnt believe how amazing the games looked at the time. Really ahead of its time.
retrogametech This was also released on the ps2 a.k.a DOA2 hardcore
retrogametech Ah one of my favourites! I really like the music in DOA 2. Oh and Tengu is the most annoying, cheap boss in DOA, apart from Alpha152. Nice video Martin, nice to hear your opinion on DOA 2 I love the game a lot.
retrogametech ive never played any of the dead or alive games
retrogametech I cant believe you dont have a video capturing device, someone should send you one
retrogametech Hes a pretty cheap boss. It definitely gets frustrating when he spams the same unblockable move at you :P Thanks for watching!
retrogametech The japanese limited edition also has the CG gallery in the game.
retrogametech Thanks. The SLG only has one VGA input. Youre best option would be to get a switcher of some sort. I might do a vid about it soon. Ive been using mine for a few weeks now and love the thing. I only use it on the Dreamcast though. I wasnt too impressed with its performance while using the Mega Drive or Saturn.
retrogametech Thank you. Im glad you enjoyed it :)
retrogametech that was beautiful and very soothing
retrogametech I live in Ayr and i have to say your town is better :P
retrogametech Ive seen too many 80s action movies so I recognised that dopey voice of his straight away. I had a good chuckle when I saw the workout tape lol
retrogametech Oh my god, Martin I live in strathaven and go to holy cross , just around the corner from bm and sainsburys ( where he started off :D
retrogametech Thanks :) And yeah, Power Glove are pretty awesome :)
retrogametech Nice video. What are the chances of you doing some sort of urban exploration videos?
retrogametech i know this only applys for some countries the the entire time i was like o shit head heading right for them.
retrogametech Yeah, the sky was a pretty cool colour that day :)
retrogametech Thanks for putting this up what was  is the camera ?
retrogametech I like to see other countries roads and stuff. I live in lower central Oklahoma US, its basically the same lol
retrogametech Dont tell me you buy old cars and refurbish them too. :)
retrogametech Those are probably hatched markings vehicles are supposed to stay off them in order to keep space between the lanes.
retrogametech I can watch that kind of thing till the cows come home :)
retrogametech Thanks dude! I dont think I left a comment, but I loved seeing you drive around snowy Finland a few months back. Great choice of music on that one! :)
retrogametech Love your dash cams man, really cool, always good soundtrack too!
retrogametech Its the perfect runabout for nipping out to Sainsburys :P
retrogametech Thanks, really glad you enjoyed it! :) I actually had this video uploaded and sitting on my channel as private for about a week. I wasnt sure how it would be received since its not quite gaming related. Its good to know people have liked it :)
retrogametech Thanks, glad you liked it.
retrogametech Fantastic video! Id love to visit the UK! And I LOVE that music, Ill have to checkout more of what Power Glove has to offer! Definitely had a retro 80s vibe to it, which I loved!
retrogametech Thanks for bringing me to the attention of Power Glove. Their Maximum Potential track with samples from a Dolph Lundgren 80s workout tape is the stuff of awesomeness.
retrogametech On street parking is not uncommon here. Roads are generally narrow and space is at a premium. You can park where you want as long as theres no restrictions and youre not causing an obstruction to other road users. But this is mostly me driving through a speed restricted residential area. You wouldnt see someone park like that on a busy main road for example.
retrogametech looks wierd to see places youve seen on a video haha :D
retrogametech You adjust to it really quickly. Ive driven in countries where they drive on the right and it only takes minutes to adapt (or die! :P).
retrogametech Excellent, the road layout actually reminded me a little of Sweden, where I live. Especially earlier in the clip, in the city. Really good choice with the lowkey electro music, fit perfectly, Bravo.
retrogametech Youre on the wrong side of the road.........
retrogametech omg everyone in going on the wrong side of the road xDDD
retrogametech Not sure which ones youre referring to but if theyre near a pedestrian crossing it means no stoppingparking.
retrogametech Thanks, glad you liked it. I love driving at night, too. Very early morning is fun too. Zero traffic so you get the roads to yourself :)
retrogametech What kind of motor you got mate? Sweet video
retrogametech RetroGameTech Im guessing you either live in Quarter, Glassford or Strathaven. I live in strathaven :D
retrogametech Most Corsa drivers do :P
retrogametech Haha, wish I could capture something a cool as that!
retrogametech Thanks. Id like to but I dont think theres anything too interesting around my area. If I find something cool to explore Ill definitely do a vid though :)
retrogametech I like these videos its nice to see something different once and a while.
retrogametech Were some of the parked cars halfway in the lane you were in so you had to dodge them? ( 2:26 ) Is that a normal thing? I noticed that too in some Japan driving vids and it just seems like a very bad idea... CRASH!
retrogametech Thanks for posting my hometown, you drove past my folks house too !! :) Im a bit more out in the stix now mind you ! Not far from your good self. Keep up the great work.
retrogametech Cool video. Kind of reminded me of MSR on the Dreamcast.
retrogametech Nicely done, enjoyed that.
retrogametech cheers for the info on the music. shades of daft punk.. which can only be a good thing. :) cool vid. ive got my theory test on tuesday.. finally gettin round to it. lookin forward to toolin around town, with some tunes like this bangin out.
retrogametech Haha, I used to love watching that show.
retrogametech Ya, have you seen Worlds Dumbest Criminals? And i thought i laughed loud, bet the cops that watch the security footage laugh as well haha.
retrogametech Power Glove are most definitely worthy of a listen! :) Ive been looking for a good excuse to use one of their tunes in a vid for ages :P. I freakin love the synth sound and electronic drum fills they use! xD Good luck with the theory! Its extremely easy so dont sweat it. Driving is great fun, just wish it wasnt so damn expensive :(
retrogametech What are the zigzaggy lines on the sides of the roads?
retrogametech you from hamilton ??? i stay like 5 mins away, in bellshill :P
retrogametech The guy in the corsa in front for a while looks dodgy
retrogametech I have sensory overload just looking at it lol
retrogametech Was about to ask re the track, but then I read the description :) their music sounds excellent!
retrogametech Are you driving the Batmobile? :)
retrogametech Thanks. Ive actually been watching a few Swedish YouTubers do driving vids recently. Looks like a beautiful country! Id love to visit some day.
retrogametech wait for the meteorite itll happen someday. leave the dash cam on :D
retrogametech Ahaha, I was wondering why I felt like I was watching an 80sRocky montage.
retrogametech I could never drive safely on the streets of Scotland. The steering wheel and trafic flow is on the opposite side. Just watching you drive makes me flinch like im going crash.
retrogametech Looks so much like COPS haha. I miss that show
retrogametech Love the vid and music, you may also like Wavestar  John Dyson
retrogametech aw were u in hamilton if u work there a have a nice place u caan go for lunch i work there :)
retrogametech Fun video, and the music fit the mood really well. I will definitely be looking up Power Glove.
retrogametech Not from Hamilton but I stay near to it :)
retrogametech MARTIN DO U LIVE IN STRATHAVEN !!!!!!!!!!!
retrogametech what kinda car do you drive lol? had to be asked
retrogametech you can backlit a gameboy advance using a kit from china, heres a video proof: watch?vXiu2sXSyBBc
retrogametech I was wondering the Same thing. WHERE THE HELL DID THAT SONIC GAME AT 10:28 come from!! Someone must know!
retrogametech The three best sources are as follows: eBay (just search for DMG backlight) kitschbent . com (offers both single color backlights and ones with an RGB LED to allow for different colors to be selected) nonelectronics . com (Nonfinite is similar to Kitsch)
retrogametech No, you can only frontlight those unfortunately.
retrogametech A 12 year old Ed trolling Game Gear owners? :P
retrogametech Could you do a front light mod tutorial for GB Colo(u)r, please? Ive seen only one other on youtube and Id love to see how you would do it. Itd really help me out!
retrogametech whats your honest thoughts on a original gameboy with backlight? do you get good contrast or is it washed out? also does it show up all the dust etc? would you recomend it or not?
retrogametech Could I do something like this with the original GameBoy Advance? I like the way the original feels in my hands, but there is no version of it with a light built in.
retrogametech would this work on a wonderswan mono?
retrogametech thanks for the reply i just rewatched the vid does the screen look faded like it does in the vid or in person is ther more contrast? and what would you say is the best color back lit screen? are other colors better suited? thanks
retrogametech what does dmg stand for? dot matrix game? nice work mate. i could have done with this back in the day.. got the gb near release and often id be playing it in the back of the car on the way to visit family friends, trying to tilt it so i could use the street lights to see.. then later upgrading to the magnifier  light clip on.. lol
retrogametech you can solder to the 2 points dirrectly below the ribbon cable at the bottom
retrogametech Those are 2 of the easiest points youll find.
retrogametech You can get the backlight on NonFinite! And also KitschBent or what ever its called!
retrogametech Im curious if something like this would be doable to the Wonderswan. Ill have to get one and try it.
retrogametech Theres no other logical explanation, got to be magic! xD
retrogametech Search YT for game gear ds backlight P
retrogametech Alas, the original GBA cannot be modded to be backlit. You can, however, swap out its screen for a GBA SP AGS101 screen to have a backlit original GBA.
retrogametech does it effect the battery life very much?
retrogametech unles youbought a mini voltage regulator those little ones for get what there called but i have one used with my raspberry pi portable then you could just go straight from the batterys
retrogametech I remember that video of yours, Ill just have to dig though the mountain of broken ds screens i have LOL thank you
retrogametech Certainly beats strapping a clumsy light to the system
retrogametech Your videos are very interesting to watch. I like to buy broken systems off ebay too. Recently bought i couple of PSPs, that ive fixed up (mostly cosmetic damage to housing etc), one of which I actually use myself. Keep your videos coming!
retrogametech Do you have a specific link for this backlight?
retrogametech Thanks, glad you enjoyed it :)
retrogametech How much does it affects the battery life?
retrogametech the day after you made this video, I bought a gameboy on amazon for 25 worth 85 to me.
retrogametech Awesome mod man! Kinda sad when I heard that you cannot do a backlight mod on the NeoGeo Pocket Color, guess I will have to go back to using a flashlight D:
retrogametech Nice vid, is this harder to do on the Pocket?
retrogametech Would you be able to use one of the late model, backlit SPs to replace an original GBA or even GBC screen for the backlight?
retrogametech I remember plugging in a tiny angler fish lamp into my game boy so I could play Super Mario Land 2 at night! Good times! I need to get myself a gameboy! Because after I watched this video I found my old gameboy games! haha
retrogametech Shame it doesnt appear big enough for a game gear screen
retrogametech Whats the best way to clean the adhesive off the back of the screen? I tried cue tips but they left little pieces of fuzz.
retrogametech Since when did Sonic come out on the Gameboy? Im sure Sega and Nintendo were huge rivals at the time?
retrogametech Id rather desolder the cables, less of a danger to destroy such a nostalgic thing.
retrogametech How did you get sonic on the original gameboy?
retrogametech Nice page! and videos! If your ever looking for hard to find games or anything let us know! We carry a lot of the classics!
retrogametech your videos are just so good!
retrogametech Oldie but goodies! As love old fashioned stuff like this!
retrogametech where did you get the clear gameboy shells?
retrogametech Oldie but goodies! As love old fashioned stuff like this!
retrogametech where did you get the clear gameboy shells?
retrogametech Thank you for letting me know. This video was awesome by the way. New sub. for sure.
retrogametech I want to backlight a GB Pocket.
retrogametech You need to bivert them.
retrogametech Oh I see. I got mine from some slightly dodgy website that sold them preinstalled. Either way, it made the original GBA actually playable instead of a dark piece of crap :)
retrogametech Lol yeah I would so be trolling game gear owners if I had a back lit gameboy. xD
retrogametech I tried this mod after watching you video. I messed up though. After peeling the back reflective piece off I had a sticky residue remaining on the back on the screen. Is that normal or did I not peel it correctly? I also put too much stress on the LCD and one I installed the actual backlight the LCD had pixels missing. Not sure if its beyond repair now. Not as easy as it looks!
retrogametech I mean, a discreet front lighting or some kind.
retrogametech hi do you do these for customers? i would like this done to my gameboy can you pm me? im in uk
retrogametech Hi i cant find these backlight kits on ebay? What are they called?
retrogametech I gave my honest thoughts in the video. And itll only show up dust if you dont remove any while installing.
retrogametech i dont know too much about electronics but there are any other two points to solder the cables? ive already done one DMG with this method but those two soldering points are annoying.
retrogametech I highly doubt this is possible but, if you bought the backlight for the GameBoy original, and scraped off the back of it, could it be used as a frontlight?
retrogametech Hi, nice vid! I want to make this mod, but have one doubt. The original screen is super when playing outside, even better with direct sunlight, will I lose this funktion if I switch to backlight screen? (I hade many DS and PSP consoles and they are unplayeble in direct sunlight...)
retrogametech Super guide buddy, I really enjoyed watching that. Very clear instructions  as ever, you make it look so simple.
retrogametech Have you tried rotating the dark polarizing film 90 degrees when you put it between the backlight and the screen? If you put it in at the wrong rotation that will invert the image.
retrogametech Thank you very much! )
retrogametech It adds a lot of functionality to the system. You can actually play it in the dark now! :) I wish Nintendo had shipped them like this.
retrogametech I need to know what music you used in this video. It sounds epic.
retrogametech awesome then, Ive always wanted to backlit my dmg gameboy !
retrogametech I remember having to give up on my Game Boy because it started losing vertical lines down the sides. I wonder where it went to as thats probably easily fixable these days.
retrogametech It certainly makes quite a positive impact on these.
retrogametech damn , your videos are some of the most interesting on youtube
retrogametech Ive done this mod myself it looks good in real life but cameras do it no justice
retrogametech hey thanx for the inspiration on this, just finished mine. do you think the white makes the screen a little washed out?
retrogametech Thats an awesome mod to an original Gameboy (it makes it look better than without a backlight. Could you do a video on how to make a backlight for the Gameboy Pocket?
retrogametech Congratulations man.. they look absolutely amazing with the backlit screens :) I imagine they look even nicer up close! Do they consume more juice now though?
retrogametech the game image looks a little washed out and faded when lighted is that how it looks in person?
retrogametech I did a video about it not too long ago. Its a bootleg game.
retrogametech Well this next on the list once Im modding my gbc.
retrogametech Nice mod!!! Looks too tricky for me, better seek out someone with good fine motor skills for pulling off that film!!
retrogametech Ive read about it but I think its really only for people who want to use the DMG for music production.
retrogametech It works really well. I definitely recommend giving it go.
retrogametech You have backlights on the brain! xD
retrogametech Is it possible to do a backlight mod on the Neogeo pocket?
retrogametech Now I want to play Super Mario. I guess its a small thing in terms of consumption, but do you have any idea about the impact of the backlit module over the battery life? You have a great channel, I am glad I stumbled upon it some months ago.
retrogametech Where do you buy your kits? Ive looked everywhere.
retrogametech Is there some sort of mirror film or alike that should not come of when peeling off the film you do at 03:40? Because i know have a backlighted DMG, but an inverted image.
retrogametech Ah, i thought the thing was so bright it over powered the screen so it was hard to see. I have seen a few other videos where the guy used a green light, or maybe it was a film, which looked alot better than the blue. Ill take a look at the twitter pic, whats your twitter name?
retrogametech Soooooo how much for a job like that??? I will pay!
retrogametech So we can use the same method for Game  Watchs?
retrogametech that old tutorial is mine haha! im glad it was useful for your mod :)
retrogametech there was going to be one. there are pictures of it
retrogametech I might consider selling it if it didnt have all my saves from the last couple of years stores on it :P
retrogametech Very nice looking unit! Specially when it is inside the controller and you cant see the two bright leds thru the case.
retrogametech Tried this mod and ended up destroying the VMU :(
retrogametech That is neat. I always felt the dreamcast had the most unique memory card.
retrogametech Thanks. I think Ill try it on a blue and classic white VMU next. I do like the transparent green, though :)
retrogametech Very cool, Lovin the background music as well. Kept thinking of Jet Set Radio Future.
retrogametech Shhhhh..... secretly Im destroying every Nintendo console I can find.... I make vids about faulty GameBoys every now and then just so nobody suspects what Im really upto! SEGA FTW!! Shhhhhh.....
retrogametech Tutorial would be awesome fella )
retrogametech Very cool! I might have to try this mod soon...
retrogametech oh lol, well then I have a video to watch later
retrogametech Man that looks awsome..great job bro! :)
retrogametech it was probably not used for years so Im not sure if with more usage itll stop doing that or if it will get to the point to where it stays like that and ruins the screen. I bought some batteries for it so that way the little icons will light up since a lot of the ink or whatever built up the most around those. Im curious as if it anyone else has ever had that happen. If it keeps happening Ill post a video of it on my channel.
retrogametech Its probably closer to seconds :P . I didnt actually test but Id guess it wouldnt be that great.
retrogametech I actually did a video about that a while back :P
retrogametech Could you sell me one of these please???
retrogametech I think I have a couple sitting in storage waiting to be refurbished. They arent that common but theyre also not rare.
retrogametech How longs the battery life?
retrogametech Thanks, I appreciate that :)
retrogametech Ah, I remember you compared the two side by side at some point, I suppose that sports edition was a loaner.
retrogametech Thanks Thomas! Yeah, I was really interested to see how it all went together. That video by engineerguy I linked to in the description is a good watch if youre interested :)
retrogametech With the battery life of a standard VMU, Im surprised your backlit one didnt die just while you were filming the video.
retrogametech I kinda thought so too :P
retrogametech The battery life was never great but personally it doesnt affect me. I never use my VMUs away from the console so most of them have just had their batteries removed.
retrogametech i love it  but i guess this mod will drain the batteries even faster now :D
retrogametech great mod, interesting idea to use the back light from a broken DS.... wonder if that same back light would work on a GameGear.....I need to look into that. How is the battery light? as even without this mod, the lifespan of VMU batteries are not long.
retrogametech Grease the gears and rails in the GDROM drive. I just use mechanical grease. Some stuff that goes on my mountain bikes bearings :)
retrogametech Man how great and ahead of there time was the dreamcast btw love the Doa music
retrogametech Man, thats so awesome, the VMUs had such a cut design, I wish theyd sold MP3 players in the shape of VMU, Id sooo much buy that shit D:
retrogametech you know, haters have no place in the retro world, retro is retro, rather it be sega or nintendo.
retrogametech Not really youll probably need to install a frontlight in there.
retrogametech Not really youll probably need to install a frontlight in there.
retrogametech the best light to use for a gameboy color, is the frontlight from a GBA SP
retrogametech Lol, its funny you mention that. Keep an eye out for my next vid. Should be up very soon :)
retrogametech Good work, Martin. Of course the second time around is better you have gained so much more experience in modding. Hows this for a challenge: I would like to see you apply a back light to an original Game Boy just for fun. :)
retrogametech I must say, you are my favourite gamingmodding youtuber. :)
retrogametech great work martin , awesome stuff as allways! i still not found a dreamcast! still got the vmu! ready! lol )
retrogametech You should make a vid :)
retrogametech Great stuff mate. I would love to do this with mine but I am not that great with electronics.
retrogametech Damn, thats pretty sweet.
retrogametech Awesome job Martin :) Looks great. Interesting how the backlight is made and put together.
retrogametech If only I had a dreamcast... I mean, this mod is really, really good!
retrogametech That is truly impressive. I dont think I have one VMU that still has working batteries.
retrogametech Very cool! I miss my main green VMU I had back in the good ol days! :) DOA all the way!!
retrogametech You seem to have good knowledge of the VMU components so maybe you can answer this. I got a DC yesterday with controllers and everything and the VMU works but after using it later I noticed the screen filled with the ink or whatever that type of panel uses (like when you drop a battery alarm clock and the screen busts) but I turned it back on and it still displays fine. Then shut it off and hours later the color finally went back out of the panel. Im not sure if itll keep doing that or not
retrogametech Awesome, Ill give it a try this week, have a bunch of DS spare parts here
retrogametech cool mod mate, never really thawt about doing this 2 my vmus, i have an old backlit casio watch wonder if i can take it apart maybe tricky on something that small
retrogametech No, you can only front light those. Youre only other option is to find an AGS101 SP.
retrogametech Nice mod have seen this done in a original gameboy or gameboy advance. You have skills with the soldering iron.
retrogametech wow that is awesome!!! would love to have one of those..... excellent work Martin :)
retrogametech so how many min the batteries last? :p
retrogametech Thanks. Its not overly complicated, just really fiddly work :P
retrogametech sadly you cannot backlight a gameboy color, as the lcd isnt transparent anymore. for gbc only frontlighting works.
retrogametech Is the jap ese dreamcast controller any different from the uk one. Is it any better?
retrogametech Greaselubricate the rails the laser assembly is on, that and installing a quieter case fan. Definitely greasing the rails as it made a massive difference for me.
retrogametech Very cool, I never had a VMU in the Dreamcast days. Funny how the WiiU essentially has the 2013 version of the idea.
retrogametech You should have put a switch on it to turn the light on and off. Otherwise, AWESOME!
retrogametech Are these sell on ebay? I need one badly!
retrogametech Mate lovin your videos. Youve inspired me to get as many 360 games as possible and im holding you fully responsible for my ebay addiction! Lol. Best thing tho is that your scottish! Im living in australia but im from ayrshire. Keep up the good work mate!
retrogametech Lol, so true! :P . Now I get to create a rechargeable VMU hack xD
retrogametech Great little mod. Excellent idea.
retrogametech That DoA2 Training Mode memories. 3
retrogametech Great! I always thought the DC VMUs were an awesome idea.
retrogametech Wow, good memory, lol. Id totally forgotten about that. That was a console someone sent me to be modded with a region free BIOS. Theyd imported it from the US if I remember correctly.
retrogametech Lol, happens to me too. I just dont make vids when it goes badly wrong :P
retrogametech yeah some are truly bad, the Jag, Virtual Boy, few others, but I have to say growing up on NES, and just recently owning the Master System and getting more into Genesis now then I did before, I still love both pretty evenly
retrogametech Thanks dude. Yeah the music is from a Dreamcast game. Its BGM from DoA2 :) . One of my favorites.
retrogametech Why? The Ps3 thumb sticks are fine. Plus, The Wii thumbsticks are better than the GC thumbsticks.
retrogametech Thats really cool. Shame those batteries were such a pain. Id also like to thank you for the Sega Microsoft controller evo vid. Im very fond of the Dreamcast pad, and your observations on the subsequent Xbox controllers make an interesting point. I did find it interesting that they put a screen on the WiiU. It looks a bit like a tribute to the old VMU screens on your controller.
retrogametech I have a stack of used PocketStations if you want to have a stab at modding one of those (free of course)
retrogametech Bro i think its a great deal, i have read that in the UK they maked a Turbografx on very limited quantities and i believe this is one of them, so if im correct you have a rare Turbografx, i live in Santiago, Chile and i owned one as a kid, and the stickers were different, mine said the whole Turbografx 16 with red and yellow letters, i hope you can do some research and answer my commentary, greetings!
retrogametech didnt know the european version had built in AV the US version it is RF only
retrogametech Great video. Thumbs up! Would be cool to see you reflowing solder on something like this console. You got a working console with 20minutes work and 11.50. So that is great. I wouldnt personally call it pretty much mint condition mind you, considering the insides. Ha ha. Keep up the good work. Well done repairing it. All the best.
retrogametech DraculaX is SuperCD only on PCE
retrogametech I didnt know anyone who owned this system. Always heard about it.
retrogametech Well done, sounded like you surprised yourself on this one. Suppose worst case scenario, you could have kept if for spares or sold it on. Good that you got it working, although your wallet will be lighter when you track down more games for it :)
retrogametech Oh Great ! thanks for letting me know !
retrogametech Lol a PC Engine with BSoD. Cool video. Love seeing these obscure old machines. I have a megadrive. Got it for 15 pounds at some game shop in town. Works fine. It was just a bit dirty. Only game I have is Sonic 2. My mum had an atari. Shame she doesnt have it anymore.
retrogametech Another cheep system for your collection, wish I was as adept at fixing electronics, well done fella.
retrogametech its turbografx after all. no wonder that it was in a good condition. good job anyways.
retrogametech man i wish i was like you bro... clever at repairing consoles  fixing things.. im below average at best... its awesome you do these things.. (in the back of mind i think its bogus bcz i wish i could do these things like you..but at at the same time i respect you and your knowledge) i wish at the very least i actually knew you or someone like you i think it would be nice and aweome if you could help fix things.. (you should consider opening a repair site like a send in repair sort of thing
retrogametech Your Genesis Monster was staring at me this whole video.
retrogametech Why cant I get deals like this!?!?
retrogametech The game JJ and Jeff uses it ingame :)
retrogametech Glad to see you managed to bring our dead console back to life!  Enjoy Dude! Game Sensei
retrogametech where did you get the green mat? thanks
retrogametech ic102 has been replaced and the QFP with the mod lead coming off it is the original and is machine placed, the chip with gull wing leads are deffo try joints and should be reflowd. best bet is using a flux pen on the leads and using a hot air pencil to go over the joints, good work on bringing it back to life! :)
retrogametech I know this is a strech, but.... AES FLASH CART.
retrogametech great deal, great work on it  just amazing :) thumb up
retrogametech I think it might explode into flames then.
retrogametech Turbografx design was such a minger for a console  nice repair though :)
retrogametech Hey! Love your videos, really fun to watch and your voice is so calm and relaxing! Great work! :) Random question, what kind of watch do you have? Really random but Im looking after a new watch and I liked the one you got, haha :) Keep up the good work, Im a fan!
retrogametech Im getting worried , they sell brand new ones like that for 75 pound on ebay are they faulty ?
retrogametech Thanks. Fixing a lot of these old systems is generally easier than you might think )
retrogametech Game suggestions: Devils Crush  Great pinball game Military Madness  Nice little war game, not too complex Space Harrier  Pretty good port Before spending a lot of money on games, Id suggest that you download an emulator like TurboEngine and try them out. Then youll know which ones youll like.
retrogametech I was amazed by the quality of the console and packaging. I was about four or five when I got my first console, a NES, so there was no danger of me keeping it all in good nick but I had an older relative who kept his impecable. It makes me think that I had the right idea all along, after all two decades worth of pristine conditioning is great for the buyer buy only equates to around a tenner for the seller. I suppose its more a lifestyle thing but it made me feel better about my habits anyway.
retrogametech Thanks for the suggestions. Some more titles for me to add to the list and check out :)
retrogametech I was pretty surprised to win it at that price! :) After a little research it seems like a previous owner had attempted to do an RGB andor region mod. Possibly decided they were out of their depth but by that time had already killed the console. I just reconnected a couple of legs on that IC and it was good as new :) . A lucky find for sure!
retrogametech 4!? Lol and I thought I got a deal! :P
retrogametech I know but its funny how you call it a garbage bag.
retrogametech Good job. Hey even if you couldnt get it working it would have been worth if for the box and the housing of that TG16
retrogametech Id love to get some suggestions of games I should try.  the one you got is one of the best there is for the system. Id also recommend Keith Courage in Alpha Zones (platformer came bundled in some North American releases) and Victory Run (driving).
retrogametech yeah i love my jamma modded pc engine ) i bought it from a guy on the german arcadeforum for 110 including gallaga88 and gunhead aka blazing lasers i made an unboxingvideo of it if you wanna check it out, but i still have to upload some gameplayvideos of my new pc enginge games D
retrogametech Thats cool that you got a fair price and was able to fix it up. I think its interesting to see the inside of a video game console. That I wouldnt have the patience to fix them like you have. XD
retrogametech Martin, you should put ads on your videos, I feel bad watching them without giving you anything in return. Also the money generated from the ads could help let you buy more junk to repair which would in turn give us more videos :D:D:D like so he can see guys!
retrogametech can i steal all your consoles please 00
retrogametech Says no one else bid on it, says 4 bids.
retrogametech Its not that bad but the PCEngine is a lot nicer looking. The TurboGrafx was made unnecessarily large to cater to western consumers. Bigger is better and all that.
retrogametech Was that Sony chip part of the sound system by any chance? Seen a very similar looking chip in my stereo.
retrogametech Thanks! Luckily it was a pretty simple fix :)

retrogametech It looks like the console had a botched regionRGB mod attempted on it. Probably bought new and never played as a result. The UK version seems like a bit of an oddball system! its gimped in some ways and improved in others. Im looking forward to trying out some other games :)
retrogametech can i steal all your consoles please 00
retrogametech Just see you have a multi mega, i bought one from a car boot for 3. Couldnt hand over the money quick enough lol
retrogametech Not a bad find, eh? :)
retrogametech The UK version does composite out as standard. Thats about its only advantage over the US version, though. :P

retrogametech Thanks! Luckily it was a pretty simple fix :)
retrogametech Seriously Id love to know where to get one that cheap, considering how rare they are.
retrogametech After seeing the condition of the board I just assumed the thing must have been fried or previously repaired and had died again. I wasnt hopeful so it was a real surprise to see it boot up! :) I figured since the controller and game typically sell for around 10 each that I couldnt really lose :P. Problem is Ive now got a taste for TG16 gaming and would love to get the Japanese console with some games! But my wallet hasnt recovered from Xmas yet! :P
retrogametech Lol you do it everytime martin. You got an eye for a bargain. Good work man.
retrogametech I couldnt agree more. The difference between 50Hz and 60Hz is quite noteable on this system. Ive read little bit into it and it seems youd need a crystal with very strange MHz rating which you cant find anywhere else than in 60Hz Turbrograx16 or PCEngines.
retrogametech So what was wrong with it? Was it EPROM?
retrogametech I did, I just have a habit of typing while watching is all.
retrogametech Amazing! Lucky it was so easy to fix :D
retrogametech Haha, Ive seen worse and tbh I probably wasnt much better at soldering until recently :P I love these little cards the TG16 games come on! Blazing Lazers is a game Ive been wanting to try for a while. It didnt disappoint :)
retrogametech They seem to cost about 70 including postage for BNIB new old stock bundle. So not a bad saving! :)
retrogametech Were the specs of those 3machines pretty much the same? (I mean apart from the region and NTSC or PAL differences).
retrogametech Aww how do you reflow and stuff thats why I was watching I wanted to get into this sort of stuff I like fixing thing not sure if my hands will do it lol I guess I just would need to practice how did you find out that the pins where bad can you do a video of this stuff pleas ill Su. And keep a eye out
retrogametech After watching your latest vid I now want a white Japanese PCEngine! Damn you! lol Its a real shame these UK versions were gimped with 50Hz.
retrogametech wow really nice and good deal..
retrogametech If apple made the NES, they would DEFINATELY have a lawsuit for this console
retrogametech I think it was maybe a region mod gone wrong. Ill probably end up region modding it properly and also install a proper RGB output :)
retrogametech Damn! A TG16 for 11.50 pounds? Thats an epic deal indeed.
retrogametech Thanks dude. Its just a bit of luck and knowing what to keep an eye on )
retrogametech It would be nice to get an original Japanese PCEngine one day :) . They are very expensive though! Its no surprise we get the ugly cover art as usual, haha. JAMMA PCEngine? That sounds interesting!
retrogametech Nope. NEC Supergrafx was PCE compatible but also had option of two hardware scrolling layers (like Sega MD) and twice as much Sprite pushing power as the PCE  128sprites (2 x 64 sprites  64 sprites for each layer) but only if software was programmed to utilise  Daimakaimura on SG is a PCE SG exclusive  not available on any other model PCE. Btw, Sega Megadrive had 80sprites over two layers, NeoGeo AES has 1000 ! over four layers) Sega Saturn is the best sprite pusher though :)
retrogametech 15 sorry I am full of useless facts Nice buy
retrogametech havent started yet but im going to start learning soon but seeing these kinda of videos makes me want to repair broken electronics like video game consoles. Yeah the reason was mostly to learn a new skillhobby that could prove useful and fun at the same time. The idea came from watching arcade machine repair videos and my love of the old school gaming consoles
retrogametech Its from about 1989. It was never really popular in North America... AFAIK it got no TV advertising, and it was primarily sold at Radio Shack, so yeah.
retrogametech Ebay Junk??? WTF!!! EBAY GOLD!!! sweet score!
retrogametech Have you ended up getting any more TG games?
retrogametech I got a supergrafx  and still reckon the TG16 is way more ugly than that. The original white PCE was the best looking of the bunch.
retrogametech great vid..man this must be the month of the turbografx 16..i just found one yesterday at a swapmeet for 4 dollars yup true story ..i was on youtube looking for vids of how to clean and refurbish it and boom i find yourse..
retrogametech what exactly makes a cartridge a bootleg copy? is it the same rom copied to a different (illegal produced and distributed) cartridge??? ....i.e. does it have the same SNK logo ingame or anything?
retrogametech RetroGameTech That Alien 3 game is on a cartridge using an nes emulator. The alien 3 is the same as alien 3 on regular nintendo.
retrogametech Autocorrection however is not much fun especially when the font size is very small :(
retrogametech You wouldnt have been laughing had you smelled them before they got cleaned up! :P
retrogametech Awesome score on the 32x games there Martin and bootleg galore lol. I was wondering though, is that bare knuckle 3 a boot as well? Looks a bit different than the one I have. Great to see another vid from you bro. Feel free to do a bit of a long play or just gaming review on any of your games in your collection, that would be fun to watch as well
retrogametech No Wise fom oor gwaaaaaavvv
retrogametech Those are almost exactly like my Trittons but with mine both of the adjustable plastic things on the side broke in half with in a year. Had to tape and screw them back together.
retrogametech I love the fact that you stacked all Yu suzuki games together. Seems logic for me
retrogametech Yeah, has quite a few Japanese games up for sale and pretty cheap too! I saw he had a loose copy of AlesteM.U.S.H.A up for 25 just the other day! I was very tempted, lol.
retrogametech How do you bootleg MVS carts?
retrogametech Awesome Seller Ive bought a few things of the last few months, sonic for a 1 Jap version is a BARGAIN
retrogametech Yet another great video, I would be happy to watch hour long vids of your collection as well as repair vids. Keep up the fantastic work....
retrogametech I couldnt tell you, sorry. Its just the title sequence music. I dont think its in the OST either.
retrogametech do you have any game boy advance sp for sale?
retrogametech Depends on the game but nowadays MVS carts are worth a fraction of what theyd have originally cost an arcade operator. You can easily pick up some titles for under 2030. The reverse is now the case for the AES home console carts. Look and see how much the same copy of Metal Slug will cost you on the AES! :P
retrogametech Hey Martin! Nice pick ups. Subscribed to your channel not so long ago and was surprised to find out that youre a fan of DOA series. Yeah, same here and they are nice games. 1 for showcase of your entire DOA collection as someone mentioned here before. By the way whats your opinion on the latest game in the series? I personally find it pretty much ok game!
retrogametech Unfortunately I havent been able to get outside to cut wood and paint the last few weeks. So the MVS is still looking a bit naked at the moment. Should be putting it all together soon though :)
retrogametech I thought MVS carts cost like 200..or am I thinking of AES.
retrogametech This clamshell type case was also used for official PS1 rental versions and some PS1 promos. I really would have wished that most dreamcast games whould have come in these cases instead of those stupid plastic cases, that are so fragile and really difficult to replace as there are almost no repro versions made for them.
retrogametech It really is! :) One of the best games on the system I think.
retrogametech I would like to see the current gen stuff you picked up! :)
retrogametech Bootleg MVS carts are (or at least were) extremely common back in the 90s. As I understand it, a lot of bootleggers used older game carts as donors to create pirates of the newer or popular games. Burn a few ROMs, implant them into your donor cart and away you go.
retrogametech Awesome video, as ever. Ecco the Dolphin is brutally hard and has a very darktheme throughout, considering youre a dolphin. Brilliant game with a wicked soundtrack.
retrogametech StrykerEG Check out Bomb Factory  How Do You Feel? Exciter...basically, the whole album lol :)
retrogametech Thanks for watchingcommenting! :)
retrogametech Great pick ups! One day you should show your entire DoA collection. That bundle PAL DoA2 must be quite rare... How did you spot that Metal Slug was a bootleg?
retrogametech Haha, that would be Ash. A stereotypical BDSM homosexual character who was removed from western releases in a bid to presumably avoid controversy. WarioWare Twisted is batshit crazy and seriously awesome! The twist mechanic works perfectly (rumbles too!) and the game is ridiculously lol funny :) . There are a couple of US sellers right now  cart only around 11  4 postage. Worth it IMO!
retrogametech Nice fabric cutting board lol
retrogametech I am a huge fan of SEGA bootlegs too! Good finds!
retrogametech Mario is so much fun! On the first shareware I like the taxi level!
retrogametech Aliens on the DS is excellent! Im a massive Aliens and WayForward fan so it is one of my favorites on the system! :)
retrogametech Awesome video as ever Martin :)
retrogametech seems like it would be more work than its worth. Ive seen MVS boards, many rom chips. would have to be desoldered and then all that
retrogametech Totally agree. Cartridge games are just way cooler than disc based games. They look nicer stacked on a shelf, too. :)
retrogametech Are you selling any r4 cart for the ds, if not do you recommend any website that does. P.S im for the UK.
retrogametech Love your pickups mate, always something intriguing. A question re the dreamcast white labels are they legi? I see them on eBay a lot and have never been convinced in regards their authenticity. Its not a big deal on the price you paid, but I see some seller charging loads for them.
retrogametech Haha, I dont play it much. I use it for some arcade ports and thats about it. The Saturn was from that nasty polygon era between 2D 16bit and proper 3D Dreamcast :P .
retrogametech I have super puzzle fighter 2 on sega saturn, awesome game, i didnt pay a lot for it, its one of the later PAL games so it comes in a nice long box plastic case rather than the shite earlier cardboard glued to 2 trays. Aliens infestation on the Nintendo DS is a brilliant game look out for that.
retrogametech Not sure if anyone has mentioned this yet, but the PAL Dead or Alive case is actually an old case they used for rental games at Choices. I picked up Sega Rally 2 in the same kind of case.
retrogametech I just pick stuff up as I go :)
retrogametech the bundle copy of dead or alive 2 would be one that came with the dreamcast console it probably would have had an extra controller with it too you know like if you buy kinect you get kinect adventures free. hope that helps martin.
retrogametech Nope, I keep finding more interesting projects to work on. Its sitting half complete in the shed :P
retrogametech Hi Martin,im just curious whether you have studied electrical enigeering.Or did you pick up that knowledge over the internet?
retrogametech Some fantastic pick ups there martin. I take it with that metal slug footage you showed us, you have the cmvs almost finished? Cant wait to see it. At least you will have plenty of things to keep you busy when all this snow hits us this weekend.
retrogametech lol  the tranny biker on BK3 ) ooh warioware twisted, i was tryin to get hold of that a while ago, but most copies i saw were pretty expensive. so do you rate it? does the twist thing work well?
retrogametech Maybe not nowadays but back in the 90s when these carts could cost an arcade operator 1000s, Im sure a little soldering was well worth the payoff to the pirates.
retrogametech The white label discs are what the Dreamcasts nonretail review copies came on. Usually sent out to journalists before official release etc. Theyre legit. Its not a white sticker on the disc or anything like that, Its a professionally pressed GDROM. Some of them sell for a pretty penny!
retrogametech Some nice stuff there mate, Im after BK3 too. There seems to be SO many bootleg carts around for the GBA, i have a multi game cart but it wont run on my DS Lite. Metal Slug is awesome, shame its a dirty booty. Did you ever get that dodgy, fake MD with all them random switches running?
retrogametech do you have a Japanese 32x or do you have a modded PAL or something? I ask cos I have a PAL one but the games are very expensive .
retrogametech Metal slug, boot or not was a great score
retrogametech U need more Saturn games dude!
retrogametech Been waiting for a pickup video :)
retrogametech Bargain! they are still around 60 on places like Amazon etc
retrogametech the clone MD cost 30usd free world wide shipping for a brand new one its boxed ect
retrogametech Oh and as an offtopic question: Ive ordered a Japanese Mega Drive model 1 just yesterday and while Im waiting for it I started wondering whether a European AC adaptor would fit it or should I use some sort of power convertor?
retrogametech I think I have the North America release of that very Sega Tetris bootleg cart... same exact label art.
retrogametech for some reason I LOLd when you said the headphones smelled a bit suspicious.
retrogametech i obviously know fook all about neo geo.. i thought the MVS games were mahoosive arcade board type things, not big carts like the AES.. man, metal slug looks gooorgeous.. so does afterburner.. thats pretty much arcade perfect, right? the jap sonic games have so much cooler artwork than the western boxes.. i know thats usually the case, but especially for sonic, god damn i hate that pal sonic 1 box, its so bland! not like sonic at all lol
retrogametech hi martin great pick ups thhose massive mvs carts are soo cool! , and the art work on jap megadrive32x carts look so much cooler, great stuff :)
retrogametech BK3 is excellent! Id love to get a copy of the directors cut sometime. That clone MD couldnt be fixed unfortunately. Its still in my collection though :)
retrogametech i didnt know that ltered beast existed for the gba either! good find
retrogametech Ive got the bundle copy of Dead or Alive 2, think we got it at some event or something, good game
retrogametech Interesting, Why did you think it was a bootleg while bidding? . the label is convincing. The boards are a dead give away if you can see them. More info on what made you suspicious would be great to know. thanks. Side Note Ive purchased about 80 MVS carts and have never been tricked into a boot leg yet. Every cart was checked on the GOTWALLS MVS site for authenticity.
retrogametech Nice pick ups, something about cartridge games that makes them special. Love metal slug its a great game, the saturn version plays great.
retrogametech ROCKET LAUNCHEEERRRRRR
retrogametech great video always excited to see a vid pop up from you ... usually hoping to learn how to fix another console. Thanks for the VID and keep them comeing
retrogametech Exciter  Bomb Factory
retrogametech Lol, well some of the older MVS boards those carts slot into can be mahoosive :P . The AES is basically the same Neo Geo arcade hardware but consolized and redesigned to use a larger cartridge. It was to stop arcade and home consoles from being cross compatible (I believe arcade carts cost 1000s where home carts only cost 100s). Almost arcade perfect yes. I think the sound is not quite as good? The Saturn has the arcade perfect version :)
retrogametech Space Harriers looks like Kid Icarus: Uprising on 3DS :)
retrogametech Lol, oh no!! Ill need to check it! It would be kinda funny if one of the few legit games I bought turned out to be fake!, haha. But that would explain the missing manual! Thanks for the suggestion dude. Ive actually been messing with the idea of some gameplaywaffle vids. I really enjoy watching other youtubers do them so could be fun to give it a try myself :) Cheers, Luke! goes off to check BK3 cart
retrogametech The seller didnt have a picture of the cart in the listing, the auction title was incredibly vague (didnt actually say what game was for sale) and the description, again, extremely vague. The start price was also lower than it really should have been. Seller turned out to be an expub landlord selling off old carts he had kicking about. Legit and friendly guy. I wasnt tricked, I knew it was 5050 to start with.
retrogametech Dude, I just love the Japanese Mega Drive boxes, much better than European or US releases.
retrogametech How do you flash a rom onto a chip
retrogametech I like it! Cool idea but it is seams like you spent alot of time and money in to this project, excuse my ignorance but couldnt you have fit a micro SD port insted!?
retrogametech Ah man trip world! I love that game :3
retrogametech Ce here can I get one of those gb or gba USB things, looks cool
retrogametech Retro bit console I ask bout software I also wanna no can I install a Gba emulator on my harddrive n get it to work on retro bit console wit software
retrogametech You dont have to use that programmer, do you? Im pretty sure you can take the cartridge itself, with the cartridge to computer things, and then upload the game onto it. It makes sense, because in your cuter videos, you have thoose.
retrogametech So you can reuse these? Sounds a lot like how the Gateway 3DS works now (you can only use one ROM per microSD card in the damn thing).
retrogametech Can you give a tutorial on how to mod the cart to use the parts and where to buy the parts from?
retrogametech You should sell them 10 dollars for card and 5 for roms
retrogametech hi I wonder if you have tried using a sd card entry in cartridge game boy color
retrogametech Hello how are you i have a game boy advance, Can you made one Flashcart For me ill buy it from you with the WILLEM PROGRAMMER to install Roms, Can you Do that for me !
retrogametech Hey, could you upload the ROM for that bootleg Sonic for the Game Boy?
retrogametech I have a question I plan to buy a Retro Bit console from Amazon my real goal is to put a Hard Drive a 300 g drive to save all my room files n its well over 330 files but Im not sure if I will need a custom software I have chips for the room n so on to save software but not sure Im really good when it comes to fixing n putting together but I have no software smarts Help
retrogametech So will this work with pokemon games? Because the gb smart cart thing wont. I wish I had known that before I bought one
retrogametech Can you make a tutorial about this
retrogametech Can you make one for 3DS? That would by TIGHT!
retrogametech I know :( Maybe this guy can make one. The only flashcard that plays 3DS games is GW3DS, and it only works with 4.5.010x!
retrogametech Its an excellent flashcart and very good quality! Its what I use to play games like Shantae which cant be found easily or emulated properly.
retrogametech OH! Those look like the tubs from Morrisons!
retrogametech Thanks. Ive posted links in the description that have lots of info on the subject. Theres also a YouTuber called Gerry OBrien whos already done some pretty good tutorials on making flashcarts :) . I think a GBA version would probably be too expensive and complicated for me. Ill stick with my EZFlash for that system :P
retrogametech The largest capacity flash ROM I could find in a PLCC32 package was 8Mbit. The Shantae ROM is 4Mbyte so I believe I would require at least a 32Mbit chip to accomodate the whole game. I will probably have to look into different chip types and alternative methods of flashing if I want to make a repro of that game. Im trying to figure out and learn a lot of this stuff out as I go :P
retrogametech Lol, theyre worth picking up if you can repurpose them! Hacked roms and unreleased games can be very cool. Ive been wanting to try out that Streets of Rage 3 directors cut hack for a while... hmmmm...
retrogametech with this project can you also flash pc bios chips to if so that will save us a lot of time and will be easy to use i will try to find a programme that dos PC bios flashing to
retrogametech Sick project!!! Keep up the good work
retrogametech That is awesome, you rock!!! Also the Gameboys you have are cool!!
retrogametech very nice job! can you flash multiple games to those chips? that flash board thingy looks insanely complicated to a noob like me lol
retrogametech Thanks dude! But I mostly just follow tutorials or use info other people have discoveredposted online. Soldering isnt too difficult to learn either :P
retrogametech How do you know all this stuff dude?
retrogametech I can see why you want to make a reproduction cart of Shantae. Just had a quick look on ebay and the only listing on there is for a boxed, factory sealed and signed copy for 3100.00. Only 6.00 postage though. Bargain... :
retrogametech Hi there Ive been watching your videos for a littlw while now(about 45 months since I first discovered your channel) Just thought Id say great videos and projects. It makes me want to start more hardware based projects, no idea where Id start but I thought it be cool to mention youre a source of inspiration for me in a sense! Keep up the great vids and projects!
retrogametech looks very similar to mine. you may want to consider putting more sram onto the cart. maizemods.blogspot.com
retrogametech It may be a long shot, but do you think you could try making a sort of SNES or N64 flash cart?
retrogametech The clue is in its title screen :P
retrogametech How do u do this for GBA? Can u do a tutorial on it?
retrogametech 8MB is larger than 32 Mb, i am not sure if mark was referring to megabytes or megabits.
retrogametech Nicely Done! Got to love the 8Bit Generation. :) Cheers!
retrogametech If your ultimate plan is to make that game look like a normal cartridge, then I want to see the finished product. Never stop doing what you do. I believe you could work for Nintendo.
retrogametech man you are getting a sub from me because when i found your channel recently before i was always searching for stuff like you to on youtube and it is in one big bundle :3
retrogametech I was just wondering if youre still working on this Reproduction cart project. Because if you still are, I may have something that will make them look a little less messy and almost official.
retrogametech Just researching the stuff that interests me :P .Theres loads of info floating about the interwebs :)
retrogametech Hey Thomas! Good to hear from you! Programmer is very cool. I think itll come in handy for future projects :) . Surprisingly cheap too!
retrogametech man you are getting a sub from me because when i found your channel recently before i was always searching for stuff like you to on youtube and it is in one big bundle :3
retrogametech Haha, I think thats probably where I got it. Well spotted!
retrogametech I was just wondering if youre still working on this Reproduction cart project. Because if you still are, I may have something that will make them look a little less messy and almost official.
retrogametech nice work! i have a gb usb as well i use it for chiptune :D
retrogametech ive been thinking about doing this myself, but with nes and mega drive games. seems to get complicated with the nes carts, being you have to find donor carts. if you start doing more repos id definitely like to see vid on them! )
retrogametech what do you do for a living ?
retrogametech Hey Thomas! Good to hear from you! Programmer is very cool. I think itll come in handy for future projects :) . Surprisingly cheap too!
retrogametech thanks for sharing this awesome project!!
retrogametech cool project, a good way to to get rid of those shitty sports games.
retrogametech Where did u get that 64MB flash card?
retrogametech Did you use zelda dx cart or another ? I only found the cart Magical TETRIS challenge it has MBC5 and 8KB RAM for file save. Can i flash pokemon rom and save because pokemon save require 32KB RAM. Where i live, there is not much original gb cart so its really a pain in my head to make this work .
retrogametech Very nice project, Shantae is a realy cool game for the GBC.
retrogametech Hey Retro if I also live in Scotland if I was to send you my ds lite and a new case with some money would you fix it for me? You could make a video on it if youd like. Thanks :)
retrogametech Nice to hear from you again. Very cool project.
retrogametech This is great for LSDJ! or nanoloop.
retrogametech I accidentally sent that comment before finishing it. On the subject of flash carts, do you still have any of those r4 cards? Both of mine have packed in and theyre getting pretty hard to come by.
retrogametech great video, you should do an instructional video or try to do a gameboy advance model
retrogametech Thanks Ed. Good to hear from you too! Xmasnew year was a busy time! Been taking a bit of a break from making vids. Catching up on some projects and actually playing my games :)
retrogametech Are you going to be doing any more videos on this? Its very cool and Im rally interested in it and would love to see more videos.
retrogametech I also think this would be a good idea. like a gameboy everdrive of sorts
retrogametech Your brilliant,I love your videos .I always learn something. Thank you.
retrogametech Rubs hands together evil laugh xD
retrogametech Thanks dude! Sockets are usually sold in large quantities and work out to be pennies each. But, you should only need one for your test cart. For the actual repro carts the chips will be soldered direct to the PCB and hidden from view :) . Chip prices vary depending on order quantity. Generally each 4Mbit chip will cost 11.50. Overall its quite affordable :) . But soldering all those tiny wires cost me a LOT of time!! :P Lol, baby steps!
retrogametech Looks like youve saved yourself a lot of fun, soldering chips onto board only to find they are faulty ) Would be funny if you managed to find Shantae in a cheap buy it now listing. But failing that, making one yourself would certainly be a fun project.
retrogametech AMAZING VIDEO! make sure to keep us updated with the information and the project. I enjoyed it greatly and now i need to do it
retrogametech That is some epic shit right there man, awesome job!
retrogametech Do you know how to do this to gameboy advance as well?
retrogametech could you make a gameboy game cartridge that reads games off a SD card?
retrogametech can this happen for gameboy advance games as well?
retrogametech is there something similar for the snes (Super Nintendo Entertainment System)
retrogametech I wanted to do this before too. I have found some schematics to do it and bought everything that needed for 5 carts  was a lot of money. The problem is the flash chip. There is only 1 company that sells it but only in giant packs and that is a whole lot money I cant afford... :(
retrogametech What if you put a gba rom on it? would the gba be able to play it?
retrogametech Hi, Would you sell one of those cartridges?
retrogametech it is at first Ive let my friends play around with mine they get so confused but when you learn how to use it it feels so good :)
retrogametech i bet this video was disliked by the guy who made that sonic game
retrogametech Cool, Ive still to try out LSDJ on mine. It looks complicated! haha
retrogametech I wanted to put some ROMs on cartridges, but I want the thing to look authentic, and not be a regular sd flashcart. I was wondering where the chips and flasher could be purchased so that I could try to flash a chip, and install it in a cartridge
retrogametech I really want to flash Earthbound to a Mother 2 cart. Do you think this is possible?
retrogametech Would it be possible to make a micro sd slot on the cartridgeand load games onto that so you could have crazy memory for games?
retrogametech One of MacGyvers best friends!
retrogametech Thats really cool. I just want to know how I can get the yellow color out of my game boy case
retrogametech why your gb god red buttons and mine got lige purpleish butons ?
retrogametech Also, Im sure you know this already, but check the legs coming off the chips in that Conker game. One could be floating a tiny bit off the contact and itll screw up the whole game.
retrogametech Anyone know how to fix horizontal lines on the Gameboy screen?
retrogametech The game probably has the common problem of the battery dieing in which case you just need to solder in a new one
retrogametech If you are interested in making GB Flashcarts for homebrew, let me know. I have worked on it in the past (have a video somewhere) and am working on an updated kit.
retrogametech Been fixing Gameboys for years and never knew about that thing with the screens, I figured they were just broken. Thanks for that!
retrogametech Hey mate, just wanted to say that I really admire what you do. Its so fascinating. The time and effort you put into refurbishing collectibles makes me want to do the same. Keep up the great work!
retrogametech Im blown away about the screen fix! Im totally going to fix mine now!
retrogametech could you maybe fix my snes mini. it wont power up
retrogametech I wish you had actually shown a method for cleaning the battery terminals. I have an extra Game Boy where acid has leaked all over them. Ive done my best to clean them up letting them soak in baking soda and bleach. Then scrubbing them with a welders brush. But, I still cant get it to power on.
retrogametech HOW IN THE MOTHER FUCK DO YOU DETATCH THE RIBBON CABLE!???
retrogametech how much is a gameboy in the new condition worth?
retrogametech Just to inform ya dude,gb system is not trash,its one of the most succseed nintendos console system,one of the nest portable console ever made in the age of its release
retrogametech I love these videos, nostalgic times.
retrogametech Nice tip for repairing missing pixel rows, hadnt thought to try that.Ive fixed a game cartridge with faulty mask ROM before. Seems the issue was that some of the bonding wires inside the IC package were loose from the chip. Squeezing the ROM chip hard seemed to make it work for a moment, so I did a permanent fix by wedging a wad of paper between the IC and the top of the cartridge shell.
retrogametech Can you fix the screen and clean up my gameboy ? Please!!!!!!
retrogametech Thx you fixed my game boy
retrogametech Do gameboy colour games even work in gameboy.i think they do because there exactly the same as gameboy games just when you put them in a gameboy colour they work in couloir not just black and white
retrogametech Thanks for this! Just repaired the screen of a game boy I got at the boot fair for 3!Ive fitted a new screen cover too and cleaned it up, and its literally MINT now!!! :)
retrogametech Thats a Game Boy Color game... do those work in the original Game Boy?!?!? I had no idea!
retrogametech Your video actually helped me to fix Nintendo. Thanks
retrogametech I have two still in the box, never opened and with the factory seal on the box, Im not ready to sell them!!!! I think Im going to wait another 25 years!
retrogametech What temperature is the soldering iron set to? Im guessing its not too hot. Thanks
retrogametech You are a wizard ! Where did you study ?
retrogametech Liked and Subscribed. Thank you
retrogametech Youre right, thank you.
retrogametech how long did all this take ?
retrogametech The previous owner is no longer happy about the money he gained.
retrogametech Lol I have the same triwing screwdriver as u
retrogametech Awesome and very educational im planning to buy broken gameboys as well since i dont know anything about computers im very happy to see videos like this. Ive always loved those old Gameboysold games.
retrogametech then why everyone calling them DMG? sorry for my ignorance...
retrogametech Ice got an original Gameboy Color if anybody wants to buy it?
retrogametech Looks like new. I just turned two broken DC into one fully working one. Now I have parts for a JP dreamcast I may put on eBay. Main board and GD Rom board. May paint the shell for fun.
retrogametech i dit bought 2 gameboys for 10 euros excluding shipping costs. after i had cleaned them,they work,however by 1 of the gameboys 1 battery connection has been rust,i tryed to remove that rust with sandpaper but it doesnt work. by the other gameboy it does work via batterys but one slight move and the gameboy shuts off. they both work with adaptor. they both are also yellowish.
retrogametech anyone noticed thanks nerd on the package?
retrogametech pretty common knowledge with engineers and hobbyists. :)
retrogametech Awesome, didnt know the screen issues were that easy to fix thanks!!!!
retrogametech i like all your videos.
retrogametech Do you have a gameboy printer i would like to see it in video if you have one
retrogametech Hope the previous owner is watching..
retrogametech fixing a dead machine isnt free either
retrogametech pretty common knowledge with engineers and hobbyists. :)
retrogametech Awesome, didnt know the screen issues were that easy to fix thanks!!!!
retrogametech Achievement unlocked: Fix a Gameboy Original
retrogametech hi do u know ware thre is anay Retro shop in scotland asz i am from glasgow thanks what i gret video
retrogametech i like all your videos.
retrogametech Hope the previous owner is watching..
retrogametech fixing a dead machine isnt free either
retrogametech Can i buy the conkers pocket tales from you?
retrogametech I knew immediately when you said that it had the horizontal black bar, that you had no game inserted. No, it has nothing for you to do without a game. I dont know of any cartridge consoles that had any form of an interactive OS without the game cartridge. Also, youll never see game save datetime on this thing. Good luck kind sir!
retrogametech Thats what I hope every time I buy something to fix :)
retrogametech My friend has two original Nintendo Game Boys. One of them has the same problem with the battery leak. I easily fixed it! His screen cover was also fallen off and I used this one type of adhesive, which I forget...
retrogametech How do I reattach the rubber strip under the screen? Im planning to repair my childhood Game Boy that has dead pixels.
retrogametech heard of Gameboy DMG power adapter? micro USB 2 DMG power
retrogametech You just saved a lot of money!
retrogametech How did you take off and reattach the screen lens?
retrogametech Thanks. Glad you like the vids.
retrogametech RetroGameTech, was the repairing process of this GameBoy enjoyable in the sense that the end result was well worth it?
retrogametech Id advice just buying a new one off ebay. Probably about 5 to 8 bucks and it will make it look a lot newer.
retrogametech Ive seen modded ones go for 150 Therefore yes there is a pretty penny to be made )
retrogametech I love your vids. Keep up the good work.
retrogametech good idea loving that for the next video!!!
retrogametech Whats the problem? It might be a problem with your console.
retrogametech Very nice video. I do similar stuff.I have a GB laying around I forgot about and I didnt know how to fix the missing screen areas till I saw this. Good stuff.
retrogametech this is a cool channel subscribes
retrogametech Great fix on the screen . And great idea using ice cube tray top video .
retrogametech Zach Radge, The easiest way to do it is the take out the mother board from the front housing and just push it out from the inside
retrogametech I have a new game boy green, can anyone want?
retrogametech tri wing screwdriver (to open up the console)  a soldering iron (to go across the ribbon cable points below the screen).. He makes it quite clear in the video, lol )
retrogametech what soldering iron do you have?
retrogametech 4:23 Im more interested in the Back section. XD Btw, great video! :D 1 like
retrogametech In all actuality, horizontal bars are very troublesome. There is a second ribbon cable underneath the screen which deals with horizontal lines. That, unfortunately is un fixable. I would consider either buying a new one or roughing it with your old one.

retrogametech dude your videos kick ass! dont stop, I always look forward to them
retrogametech would you ever do a vid on repairing a game boy advance sp???
retrogametech I find double sided tape works really well for reattaching GB screens :)
retrogametech Im watching this and dont even have a Game Boy. So interesting!
retrogametech thank you for showing me how to repair these! your work has inspired me to want to go buy a box of non working gameboys off ebay and see how many working ones I can build.
retrogametech I was drinking IrnBru while i was watching this!
retrogametech Id love to send you a haggis !
retrogametech IRN BRU! Soooo goood!!
retrogametech no it had to be changed because of false advertising
retrogametech for sure, Martin is a very generous guy. thanks a lot and I think you should give it a shot!
retrogametech Irn Bru is so popular in Scotland, that its the only country in the world where coca cola isnt the number one soda!
retrogametech Heres the answer to your question: Im from Scotland. I dont actually like Iron Bru but I have actually tried a deep fried Mars Bar ONCE. And literally everyone around looked at me like I was crazy. Not as popular as you may think hahaha It was pretty good though, just sort of crunchy and gooey but I wouldnt have it again :)
retrogametech Lots of mystery Christmas packages going around, love it. Great stuff guys! )
retrogametech Being Scottish I absolutely loved this :D and also being a big fan of Martin, also to the guy below me it is pronounced iron brew but it is spelt in Scottish slang.
retrogametech Awesome! Ive always wondered if it was OK to ship IRNBRU, so I can send some to my cousins in Canada :D
retrogametech hahaha, I remember that stuff man
retrogametech Ill give it a shot bro. Thanks a lot for the greetings, I wish you a happy time around the new year as well man
retrogametech I think Martin really likes you.
retrogametech Wed just end up deepfrying a taco lmao
retrogametech You should consume the drink and bars on camera! Instead of Strange Japanese Food, itd be Strange Scottish Food.
retrogametech Retro Game Tech, you are a hero. Kudos for sending the Bru and Macaroon bar overseas. Hope you like em Luke.
retrogametech Iron Bru is the best drink EVER! :D
retrogametech I knew there was something edible!
retrogametech haha, irn bru. you can find that stuff in canada too... it sortof tastes like cream soda.
retrogametech VIEWERS OF SCOTLAND CHANT IT TOGETHER NO SUR... I MEAN IRNBRU And Luke you pronounced it right! :D
retrogametech Awesome gift. Happy Holidays Luke.
retrogametech why is text on the tape dutch?
retrogametech Haggis is honestly one of scotlands gems you should try it
retrogametech IRN BRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
retrogametech Great. A ton of thought definitely went into that small package!!
retrogametech Interesting stuff there man. yeah, ill give it a shot for sure with the game and maybe it will cause some kind of trippy effect lol.
retrogametech thanks a lot man, Ill be giving it a shot soon!
retrogametech Love Irn Bru, and yeah, it definitely makes for a good hangover cure!
retrogametech Coke cola is the biggest selling soft drink in every country in the world except scotland where its irn bru
retrogametech I have never tried haggis and dont plan to! The only time really I really know that people eat it is St. Andrews Day (which is November 30th) but nobody I know celebrates it although when I was a Scout they did a little thing every year. Its really not too popular to be honest...
retrogametech Did you enjoy the iron bru? Its a nice drink
retrogametech no video of you trying the stuff out?
retrogametech Wow, surprised youve not seen them before, irn bru is the biggest selling soft drink in Scotland :)
retrogametech Thanks bro, I appreciate that you thought of me man :) dont go out of your way bro :)
retrogametech Im from Scotland , obviously or I wouldnt be wasting my time. But I dont drink so I couldnt care less about whisky, For someone your age to be concerned with something as trivial as deep fried mars bars is pretty feeble, what about the game of golf which we also invented, do your homework pal. I doubt very much you have gotten any wiser since you were my age
retrogametech Santa Clause Jr. LOL.
retrogametech Do a vid on the drink luck
retrogametech Haha, awesome gift Martin. Guessing youll be responsible for Lukes sugar high :p
retrogametech WAIT A MINUTE! Scotland??? Arent you from New Zealand?
retrogametech Cool present, love the pixel art and some tasty Scottish treats :)
retrogametech Does this mean that youll be doing another fooddrink review Luke?
retrogametech Thats cool that he sent you Irn Bru. The sweets look,well, sweet! Great for energy if youre out walking!
retrogametech super thoughtful gift! Martin is an awesome dude, love his channel for sure!
retrogametech If only they had taco bells in Scotland lol
retrogametech indeed, indeed. really cool to have gotten this.
retrogametech Be careful, Luke! I had IrnBru when I was in Ireland, and its not going to taste anything like what you might expect (despite the colour, its definitely NOT orange pop)! Heed this warning!
retrogametech Props to Martin on sending an awesome gift box, definitely makes me want to make some pixel art myself.
retrogametech lmao, haha, my old mailman used to do the same thing but that is some funny stuff bro. thanks.
retrogametech OMG watch out this package is a SUGAR BOMB OO awesome package from martin :D
retrogametech What a great gift, happy Christmas!
retrogametech at 8am this was more than I could take for breakfast, maybe later
retrogametech Iron Bru is the best drink!
retrogametech much love from europe xD
retrogametech I am living in Singapore ang mo kio ave 10 street 44 block 467 level 8 08 1010
retrogametech Awesome pressie but no Buckfast!? hehe D
retrogametech As a Scotsman, I approve of this gift a lot!
retrogametech for sure bro, for sure. I still have one more package that hasnt been opened yet. I hope the YTuber I sent it to opens it up soon :)
retrogametech Liked before watching, luke has the best unboxing vids. Congrats on the gifts  merry christmas!
retrogametech Nice gift! Hello everyone, im subbing your channel as a xmas present, so if you want one more subscriber drop me pm saying: sub me. i will accept :) Happy Xmas time Luke and everyone here.
retrogametech lol, thanks for the offer bro, I appreciate it. no need to send anything though. the fact that you are here watching the vids is cool enough.
retrogametech Oh, interesting stuff man, thanks a lot
retrogametech Now at walmart, not sure if they have them where you are, but they have these hardshell security boxes. So now you have to get it out of the box, then out of the wrapping, then 3 big ass stickers before you can open it. Dreamcast had the best game cases... i dont even know why we need dvd cases anymore for games. Just throw it in a jewel case.
retrogametech haha quality! send him sum square sausage and tottie scones next retro game tech. lol
retrogametech great video  careful with that IrnBru! Youll know what I mean when you taste it.
retrogametech Just reminds me of when the cinema snob did a brad tries on Irn Bru.
retrogametech I laminated the sides, but havent processed the video yet. Havent gotten much else done due to Christmas and all. My family decided to do handmade gifts this year, so extra time is needed to make those. :( Hehe.
retrogametech Wow Love Iron Bru, I Havent had that since i was a Kid. Time to go to the shop to pick some upm:) Awesome Present
retrogametech Thats really nice!!That Irn Brus a great drink!!
retrogametech The unexpected ones are the best! Iron Bru! CinemaSnob (Brad Jones) tried that in Brad tries, he said it was really good, supposedly is very popular there too, I have never been there so I am just going to have to assume it is. I love that Atari logo, and Space Invaders, thingy. Dont know what they are called lol. Cool stuff he sent you!
retrogametech for sure bro, wasnt expecting that at all haha. Merry Christmas to you too!!
retrogametech for sure bro. the amount of sugar in the one bar alone had me spinning for 30min. Insane how much sugar was actually in it...wait, it was ALL sugar :
retrogametech irn bru. im not scottish but i love it!
retrogametech Its definitely an acquired taste at first. But it actually tastes different depending on what it comes in 750ml glass bottle is the best one.
retrogametech IRN BRU, Made in Scotland from girders.
retrogametech Ah man I wish I saw some irn bru in Germany while living there. Sounds good from what I found out so far.
retrogametech Made from girders... lol Scotlands national soda pop
retrogametech hahaha irn bru iron brew  made in scotland from girders  great when hungover and very cold! i remember seeing RetroGameTechs video with that santa GBA game in it looked fun n quirky platform type game, you should do a video on the irn bru lol
retrogametech for sure bro. Interesting stuff, Ill give it a try. The Atari logo and Space Invaders are bead art beer coasters I think lol. Thanks bro
retrogametech Good to see that all of the retro guys on youtube stay in contact. I watch every upload from both of you guys!
retrogametech bro, you have no idea. The amount of sugar in that one bar was about a weeks intake. Supper buzzing now lol.
retrogametech Is Scottish tablet what they have instead of iPads in Scotland?
retrogametech Can you sent me all the thing that retrogametech
retrogametech NECTAR OF THE GODS! Somebody recently was telling me after doing some traveling. Its HUGE as a vodka mixer in East Europe with kids since the Soviet bloc breakup.. 5 factories alone in Russia!
retrogametech Those are some cool gifts! I want to send some nice stuff from my place too, Luke. I didnt forget about the X68000 I promised you )
retrogametech thanks bro. Yeah, Martin is a great guy for sure and has a cool channel as well.
retrogametech Piss take, who at Nintendo thought this was a good idea?
retrogametech on the wii, if you enable parental controls, all content is blocked that is higher then the rating selected. Now thats a good idea, unless ur kid is smart and can get the code easily.
retrogametech That is the stupidest fucking idea.
retrogametech I just tried it and I can watch Bayonetta 2 fine.Its 1pm, odd
retrogametech gives new meaning to fappy hours doesnt it? whats next, facial recognition to see if you look old enough to do adult things? crazy!
retrogametech Its not just the English that use sterling, the whole of the UK does, including Scotland.
retrogametech Hows it supposed to work? I go to bed at 10pm so I am fresh for work which I get up at 6am for, so unless I download at the weekend they wont be making any money from me, its a seriously dumb move.
retrogametech Damn! What about adults who go bed early!?!?
retrogametech I do and some of the smaller developers cant afford to released their games as physical retail copies. Games like Mighty Switch Force and Shantae RR are some of the best Ive played in recent years and are only available as DLC through eShop. There is good stuff on eShop.
retrogametech That sounds really stupid.
retrogametech thats because of a law in Europe for child protection.
retrogametech i try to download zombiu demo or even look at the details and it says you cannot not view or purchase this software
retrogametech I guess this is how Nintendo plans on pushing the hardcore games they promised with the WiiU. Good job Nintendo. Perhaps parents should have the responsibility of monitoring their children instead of Nintendo trying to do it for us.
retrogametech 11pm is just taking the piss. Seems they are locked to the German watershed times. Apparently they have two watersheds one at 22:00 for content suitable for 16 and up and then 23:00 for 18 content. Youd think they would implement a system which at least sticks to the watershed for each respective country...
retrogametech With the downloading between 11 and 3, does the download have to finish within that time? What if I have slow internet? Will it let the download start and then continue outside that time?
retrogametech due to nintendo based in Germany!!its crazy! great channel,i subbed after seeing lukemorses vid on your christmas present!i love irnbru!
retrogametech I think this is stupid, but I hope they remove the restrictions in other EU countries besides Germany.
retrogametech Its happening...we should have voted for Ron Paul...or is this in Europe somewhere?
retrogametech I saw this on IGN yesterday. That is bull crap. I wont face it in the U.S., but this shouldnt happen anywhere.
retrogametech You know what Nintendo needs? Offices in the UK other than Germany and thanks to that disgusting censorship and constant delays with their games. I hardly use my 3DS anymore.
retrogametech I think if Nintendo wants to be kiddie friendly, let them If you can buy another system, do it. If a company is dumb enough to restrict their own content, dont buy from them.
retrogametech Nintendo has always been heavy on censorship, their arcade ports in the 90s were almost always the censorship versions, and more so thanks to the current fad about complainingprotesting about gender identity.
retrogametech it is a cheek if they have parental control, its no different than a kid goign on the internet, it should be up to the parents
retrogametech To be blunt and perfectly honest, its fucking retarded.
retrogametech People actually buy things from the eshop?
retrogametech I think its ridiculous because whats stopping kids staying up till 11 and watching it any way... its just an annoyance for the rest of us.
retrogametech What a load of bull. Soon they will be limiting when you can play the games you have bought on your system...
retrogametech Theyre trying to avoid getting in trouble with the law in Germany due to the fact that Nintendo of Europe is headquartered there. Since thats where theyre based they have to follow German law and its really fuzzy on what is allowed for digital shops so Nintendo is erring on the side of caution and following the television rules for the eShop. Sony and Microsoft get around this due to the fact their European operations are not based in Germany and have different laws they have to follow.
retrogametech Its lame and wont do them any favours, if I was browsing the eShop and couldnt look at what I wanted Id just haul my ass over to the app store or Playstation Store and spend my money there, tbh Im more likely to do that anyway as eShop is WAY overpriced.
retrogametech what the hell nintendo...lol. I could make a 20 min video on nintendo rants but thats crazy I dont think its like that over here. Seems just silly , I was watching the nintendo direct video on youtube and I found it strange they where showing clips of ninja giadin without age restritions and the whole video was filled blood.Its probibly set up totally differant because there is no way to watch Wii U trailers on the 3ds that I can see.Also thats the main reason I want a wii u bayonetta 2
retrogametech Ohhhhh this annoys me so much. Absolutely ridiculous. I swear Nintendo are in their own little bubble. Where is the logic in this decision? Theyre shooting themselves in the foot here.
retrogametech personally i dont own a 3DS but a friend does and i think that its BS and is silly because most kids stay up late anyways these days also it wouldnt be hard to take some thing as small as a DS into bed with you. There is a way around it i help the afore mentioned friend with it by side jacking via LAN into the 3DS you can intercept the packets in a man in the middle style attack and edit the time that the DS recieves but cmon its a DS we shouldnt need to hack it to play legit content we buy
retrogametech I totally agree with you. It feels a bit backwards to restrict times to view trailers, when as you say, the console itself has restrictions in place for this sort of thing any way. Ill never understand Nintendo and their strategies.
retrogametech Boycott downloadable content. Refuse to buy it until Nintendo grows the hell up. Its obvious they havent learned from their Mortal Kombat debacle in the 90s. Nothing turns things around like a good hit to the wallet !
retrogametech PS try googling for a proxy for 3ds or wii u to connect to USJPAU servers
retrogametech i agree its gotten out of hand and plus the few games you can download are watly to dear
retrogametech Erm.... England people?
retrogametech Its the only choice for many of the 3DS games.
retrogametech Disgrace, nice video :)but i suppose its not a really bad idea
retrogametech Just another example of why I just cant take Nintendo seriously as an adult gamer. If they want buyers to believe they arent just catering to kids, theyre going entirely the wrong way about it.
retrogametech I totally agree. This kind of stuff just makes me less interested in the WiiU or browsingbuying anything the eShop. Sony already lost my custom because they insisted I spend 20min downloading and installing either a dashboard update or massive game patch every time I switched the freakin PS3 on. Its just not worth the bother! Retro FTW!
retrogametech Im an adult gamer who has a 3DS and a Wii U and Im worried about this. I havent noticed any adult content on my 3DS, so havent had a chance to try it.
retrogametech This is another reason to stick to retro gaming
retrogametech Nintendo... Please remove thy collective heads from thy collective asses. People who grew up in the 80s with the NES, HAVE KIDS NOW!!!! We are old enough to take care of ourselves and this parental restrictive bullshit just insults us for being die hard Nintendo fans.
retrogametech And that my friend is why Nintendo sucks
retrogametech And yet another reason I will not buy another Nintendo console. I almost got a 3DS a week ago sooooo glad I didnt.
retrogametech This is stupid nintendo
retrogametech please ignore the stupid internet people P
retrogametech Youre right, they should have set the restrictions in line with the parental controls, and not do a server wide ban.Theyll no doubt reverse it though.
retrogametech When I read the article about this, I felt bad Europe gamers, I think the problem is because Nintendo doesnt really have accounts that you log into the console with, instead you log into your account with the console, if they fix this problem you can have your Mii on your 3DS, then jump on your Wii U or Wii, and only adult players will be allowed to buy things or watch restricted content. But sadly, I fear that wont happen with this generation of consoles... :(
retrogametech thats some bullshit right there. its this kind of thing thats making me quite likely to avoid the next gen all together.. nay bother.. itll give me time to catch up on the classics :)
retrogametech lol thats nintendo for you, but oddly enough they are hell bent on resident evil as being of one of the systems selling points, kind of renders the idea moot.
retrogametech As soon as it starts damaging their profits, theyll soon stop. Just like their no blood policies in the 90s
retrogametech Did you film this facing the wall just to get the Christmas tree in the background? Thats the holiday spirit!
retrogametech fuck new gen i sold my ps3 a year ago and i dont regret it , retro all the way!
retrogametech Is this only in Europe or world wide?
retrogametech neeeeeeeeeeeeeeew viiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid :D :D :D
retrogametech I cant be bothered to write much about this as it would turn into and essay so I will sum it up in one word STUPID !!!
retrogametech Thanks Ashens friend for the reassurance:D. I didnt even know you watched these videos Larry, I really like your videos and think your very cool. Have a nice day!
retrogametech Im getting a little sick and fucking tired of this shit. Nintendo isnt the only one, but theyre certainly the biggest peddler of this controlling crap. Parental controls have existed for literally over a decade, whether they be ingame options or console options. What are Nintendo now claiming with this shit? That those parental controls werent suitable, that they didnt serve their task? That parents arent capable of deciding what their own sprogs can watch? Come on people, cut it out!
retrogametech Larry commenting on a RetroGameTech video? BEST AMALGAMATION EVAR :D
retrogametech I would have prefer Constructive Criticism.
retrogametech This is stupid. This is why Nintendo will never get any of my money via the eShop. This and the fact that downloads are linked to my system and not to my ID, so if my Wii dies I lose all my stuff. Ive had friends that have gotten screwed like this before. Nintendo seems to be the only one who thinks that only 7yearolds are still playing video games. Ridiculous. Hey Nintendo  its not 1982 anymore.
retrogametech Its part of the child rating laws in Germany and that is the Nintendo distribution hub of Europe.
retrogametech Totally agree! Great way to alienate and disenchant not only their existing customers but potential ones too!
retrogametech I got the 3DS as I figured trading in my DS and a old phone (that had been sitting in a drawer) against the system was a good idea, as I was only going to pay about 11 cash. Still be able to play DS games and get some 3DS games like the Ocarina remake etc. Nintendo restricting access to everyone at certain times is ridiculous. Im 25, not 7, if I want to download an 18 game at 6pm then I should be able to. Im really losing patience with Nintendo.
retrogametech Everytime i was gonna watch Nintendo 3D Show,it asks me for my age.I already set it already and it still asks me to put my fing age
retrogametech I prefer classification over censorship, and these kinds of decisions are why Nintendo will be so far behind the online aspect of console gaming and why I cant justify buying the WiiU.
retrogametech Yeah, I think this is a huge misstep by Nintendo. Its just going to further frustrate some of their audience, and thats really not what they need. Any sort of mandated censorship is bs in my opinion anyway, like that law they tried to pass in the UK about you having to call your internet service provider to enable porn to be viewed.
retrogametech This definitely wont help against nintendos kiddie console image, what an absolute joke.
retrogametech This would impact sales quite a bit. Its not just viewing content its buying new content as well.
retrogametech Cheaptendo at their worst. I mean, it would be okay with parent control and all, but this just feels like a joke.
retrogametech Im of the opinion that parents should actually do some parenting and be responsible for controlling what there children watch, download or listen to. Not that I would use the store on the 3DS, it seems very over priced compared to owning a physical copy of games they have for sale.
retrogametech Oh Man! It makes it as usable as a brick! Why Nintendo, why!!!
retrogametech Basically, unless you are a five year old kid, there is no interesting content in eShop now.
retrogametech I think if the parental options are off then people can view all the mature things they want!
retrogametech this is bullshit! whats the difference between watching a trailer on a 3ds and watching it on youtube? you can watch the trainler without any restrictions on the internet so why the 3ds?
retrogametech This is a server side restriction. You have no control over it.
retrogametech Good news Nintendo just lifted the access restrictions to mature content on both the 3DS and Wii U.
retrogametech What if you change the system clock time to a time where its unrestricted?
retrogametech ... I thought Nintendo was on the road to redemption when I saw the Wii U. I was sadly mistaken... RIP Nintendo
retrogametech I LOVE DRILL DOZER! Seriously, I wish I kept my GBA when I was a kid. If I would have known this game existed when I was a kid I would have bought five of them. The good old days served me well. I even could have played it on my ds, but still, luck was not on my side. I found it on an emulator and instantly fell in love with it. You are one sniper you clever dog! Have fun with the bonus levels, boy they are a bitch!
retrogametech The code on the blue game boy advanced is a code from germany.
retrogametech Thats not how you spell Acclaim lol.
retrogametech Oh I didnt realise, excellent :D
retrogametech I love Turok!!! I have it for the first Xbox.
retrogametech Already did one a while back :P . Just search YouTube for gba shell replacement. AGS101 and AGS001 have the same form factor so the guide applies to either :) .
retrogametech That seems about right. Germany was one of the countries that supposedly got a small number of the 101s
retrogametech Lol yeah. I see a lot on ebay, but Im thinking most might be fake or the older backlit model. Thanks.
retrogametech Love it, Ive been meaning to buy an AGS101 for the longest time now and swap its guts into a black AGS001 I have. Like others in the comments I also vote for a tutorial on how to do this. :)
retrogametech Its very good! One of the best on the system IMHO :)
retrogametech RetroGameTech i have found a mega drive in working order with all wires and 2 controllers shall i bid
retrogametech I would like a guide on how to mod a front lit gba sp to be back lit cant seem to find any on youtube.
retrogametech How difficult is it to install a backlight in a GBA SP? I have bits of fluff in the screen and need to take it apart anyway
retrogametech Did not know about the whole ags thing, look at the back of my sp, ags 001  But, it is the tribal sp, which i see is one of the limited edition ones, which i didnt know previously, despite having it for nigh 9 years
retrogametech I was going to bid on that graphite gba sp, but by the time it was one day left it was out of my small crappy budget at the time
retrogametech i hate you ! i try so hard to get a 101! i have repaired like 9 001s :(
retrogametech Hey can u make a video on how not to get ripped off on ebay,craigslist etc when buying games
retrogametech You need to buy an AGS101 then gut your own console and transfer all the parts over. You cant upgrade a regular AGS001 unfortunately.
retrogametech I wanted to see the GBA Santa game for comparison. :(
retrogametech Martin, what do you think of the new YouTube setup? Yay or Nay?
retrogametech that drill game looks pretty cool
retrogametech If you like GB.GBC,GBA games i reccomend you Gamerascal.co.uk, they have really great games and reasonable prices (for the most part). P.S. Sorry for my bad english
retrogametech The last time I played Turok was on the 64...
retrogametech Craig from tvandlust did a good review of it a couple of years ago... NiBT77gJ0uo
retrogametech Im not really looking to buy anymore systems these days  Im broke :P
retrogametech Lol GBA Games from my College Days :)
retrogametech Lol, thanks. I actually got both that blue and graphite SP in the same bundle for 20 :P
retrogametech allawys love a pick up vid even if its simpel :) come check out mine :p
retrogametech i was just watching all your videos ive just watched like 20 thanks Keep it up!!
retrogametech Eating lots of food and playing lots of games :) . The average price is 5060. A good price would be anything below 50, I guess. Theyre not easy to find and are generally very desirable.
retrogametech Enjoying Mass Effect series eh? I just finished a 13 run of the games today, female Shepard this time. I had traded in my 360 against the Halo 4 360 pack, I got 20 GAME credit back for buying the console. So got 2X 1200points and along with some spare points bought the ME2 Overlord DLC, and the ME3 DLCs Leviathan  Omega. I have all the main DLCs apart from ME1Pinnacle Station, read it was bit meh Great series, its worth doing all the side quests and reading all the codex entries etc.
retrogametech that bruce lee game is ace just for the sound effects lol. looks a great game. love mirrors edge.. fingers crossed for a sequel.
retrogametech Apparently it has been in development for a little while now :)
retrogametech THIRD! also i love your vids and im trying to repair a ds lite and an SP :D and not anover MVS...
retrogametech I have a AGS 101. They are very comon in Denmark actualy. Got mine for around 10 pund with 3 games. One of them was supar mario 3 advance thingy
retrogametech I dont mind it, it looks good. Functionality wise it doesnt affect me much either. Ive always viewed new sub uploads from the my username tab in the top right corner. That seems to still be exactly as it was before. But I wish Google would stop switching things up so often! It always causes unnecessary drama.
retrogametech Honestly, I am continually surprised by what I find. There are so many games I didnt realise got a port for the system. Some very obscure but brilliant stuff!! I have a couple dozen more hidden gems in my collection that I bet most people dont know even exist! :P . One of the best game libraries ever IMHO :)
retrogametech Drill dozer is brilliant!
retrogametech Gets a thumbs up just for your bargain hunting skills  20 for a 101 is a bit of a result!
retrogametech Brilliant games! GBA library just keeps amazing me with such quality hidden gems!
retrogametech Could I buy one of them AGS101s?
retrogametech Im getting the subscription glitch were none of your videos are showing up... thanks youtube
retrogametech desert strike advance looks really good i had it for my game boy pocket and its secwill and it would be cool to get it for the game boy advance. also is there any way to add a back light to an advance
retrogametech Interesting video video all around.
retrogametech Loving it! Completed the first one then went straight onto the 2nd. Santa is bringing me the 3rd! :). Its been eating up pretty much all my gaming time the last couple months. Im doing all the side quests and talking to everyone. I was really lucky when I bought ME1 because the guy in Gamestation threw in an unused ME2 CE DLC card! I also bought most of the DLC for ME1  2. Im totally hooked on the story and love the epic scale and detail of the games universe. Its excellent!
retrogametech Thanks, glad you liked it!
retrogametech Lol, you keep calling me Marvin, haha :P. If you liked the original Desert Strike on the Mega Drive then you should enjoy the GBA version :).
retrogametech Must have been a different auction. I won both of those in a bundle for 20 on a buy it now a couple of months back.
retrogametech i dont really hate you :P
retrogametech Its a great handheld the gba sp and that Yurok game is a gem of a game, I have that myself found it in a bargin bin with 11 more gba games all for 2.50! Have you still got that desert eagle dreamcast light gun? Could you do a video of it in action please, i have seen you video when you first had it and its so cool.
retrogametech BTW whats a good price or average price to pay for an AGS 101?
retrogametech Have you heard about the k1 gbas and the revo k101 gbas? Im not sure whether I should keep looking for a good deal on an ags101 or just pick up one of those. I currently have an ags001 and a psp, and neither really cut it for me, the psp screen has ghosting and the psp has no multiplayer and the Ags001 doesnt have the greatest colours.
retrogametech Ah you got the other one of the two on ebay I got the first one with the Z80 glitch
retrogametech The Bruce Lee game cracks me up everytime XD .Its surprisingly good, definitely worth your time! I read that Mirrors Edge 2 is in development ) . Love that game! The music and art style totally draw you in.
retrogametech RetroGameTech I will take a look, and by the way, you say you feel old Im 47 and still love playing..... Lol
retrogametech Sadly its not possible and there isnt a mod for that. What you just need to do is implant all the parts from a backlit version into your regular shellhousing.
retrogametech The thing that makes me feel old is watching a GBA gameplay vid here on YouTube then reading the comments. Theyre always filled with people talking about how they remember GBA games from their childhood!?!?.. Their childhood!?!??
retrogametech Hey...nice pick up video.like them gba games.peace an more money..
retrogametech The european code onthe blue GBA is a German Zip Code ... Its a german GBA
retrogametech would you be interested in an atari jaguar at all?
retrogametech Lol, just look for incorrectly listed auctions. The pink GBA 101 I got was listed as a GameBOX advance :P.
retrogametech Ive done a couple in the past. One of my first vids was a review of it and then one Halloween I did a tag response where I played House Of The Dead using it :P
retrogametech That Santa Claus game music for the GBC has that old school Codemasters NES music twang sound it...great stuff.
retrogametech I remember it from my younger years, I first encountered it eight years ago when I had just turned six, I still have it and play it regularly.
retrogametech YOURE SUCH A LUCKY BASTARD WITH THESE SPS FFS BIN TRYING TO GET AN AGS 101 FOR ABOUT 67 YEARS
retrogametech RetroGameTech What are you going to be doing for Christmas and the New Year?
retrogametech Hi, Im from the UK and am after one of those 10mhz oscillator crystals for my model 1 MegaDrive. where do you get yours and have you got a part number or anything? Any help would be appreciated.
retrogametech PLease can you do a tutorial showing how to do the language and 5060hz switch mod.. also overclocking one would be great too..Although i heard you dont need one of those 10mhz crystals.. you can hack into one of the cart socket traces or something.. cheers anyway
retrogametech Im trying to mod a cloned MD2. Any idea if it will work?The motherboard is an exact replica of the original. Im not even 100 sure if it is a clone.
retrogametech Great idea with the 3.5mm socket in place of the RF. Ive just modded mine following your example but used a single 3way boat rocker (onoffon). Works very well and looks nice and clean. Thanks for all your videos. They give me the confidence to have a go at modding.
retrogametech Ahhh, finally someone else who appreciates RGB SCART. I cant even bear looking at MegaDrive images in lower quality anymore, its just so crisp. I was wondering, do you have a video tutorial on modding an N64 for RGB SCART? Also, do you have any videos on repairing Game Gears? Your rambling is enjoyable to listen to for some reason.
retrogametech You know that there is a Switchless mod for 5060Hz and Language? mmmonkeyDOTcoDOTukconsolesegamd1switchless.htm
retrogametech I think in Japan they used the EXT port for a modem, but the cable for Zero Tolerance is rare because i think it was a send away thing, so youd need to make a ghetto cable not sure if a regular serial cable would work it might.
retrogametech Bit late but, happy birthday! :)
retrogametech Well worth it. It shouldnt take you more than half an hour to complete. The RF unit is very easily desoldered and once its out youll have loads of space to work with! Id actually be kinda interested to hear if you notice any improvements in audiovideo quality after removing it. Possible less interference on the video circuitry?
retrogametech Love the idea of removing the RF out and adding the extra 3.5mm jack, much better than having a wire sticking out at the front.
retrogametech Hi can u tell me what audio jack u used and possibly a tutorial on the audio jack thanks love your megadrive
retrogametech The CD32X addons will not work with an overclocked megadrive.
retrogametech cool stuff makes me want to try a regionlang mod on a genesis
retrogametech Please do this to my mega drive :)
retrogametech You would be the perfect DadBrother youd help fixmake anything :)
retrogametech Cool vid man! These vids seem cool )
retrogametech Ive been looking for switches like these for a while. I could never find them small enough and with the correct number of pins until now :) . I think removing the RF module from inside the console has possibly even cleaned up the picture and audio quality a little! Maybe something to do with less noise? But I totally agree on removing obsolete tech in place of something better or to add extra functionality.
retrogametech It makes some games run smoother. Overclocking doesnt speed anything up in terms of what you see on screen. It just gives the CPU a little extra grunt to deal with processing. If you search for Fully Modded Mega Drive here on YT youll see another vid I did comparing a stock 7MHz and overclocked 10MHz Mega Drive.
retrogametech hey yeah that would be awsome :P
retrogametech Does this work with a Sega Genesis to make it 50hz?
retrogametech As I said it was a great video you just mumbled is all. When making videos you have to know when to tell the difference between constructive criticism or bing a troll or an ahole in the comments. I was just giving some constructive criticism. No Big deal delete the comment if you like.
retrogametech Yes you will need to switch off the overclock for the Mega CD and 32x as they wont work properley with it as I think they have some kind of sync with the 7mhz clock speed and the 10mhz would mess it up. I think Virtua Racing (MegaDrive NOT 32x) wouldnt work properley either.
retrogametech Lol, I appreciate the concern but it was below zero outside and bollock freezing in the room when I shot this. Sitting on the floor at an awkward angle to the camera probably didnt help matters either :P
retrogametech I totally agree! I love the look of the first Mega Drive! :)
retrogametech Im so gonna do that headfone jack thing
retrogametech have you tryed the switchless mods cheaper then switches just saying.
retrogametech Great idea swapping the RF port for a headphone jack. Rocker switches look great and are really satisfying to press  if that makes sense.
retrogametech I love those rocker switches. Would the ones with the led status look better for the over lock one? :)
retrogametech I wished I lived in the UK. I love the way the Megadrives look with the white ring section on the front of it. I am thinking of buying a broken megadrive and swapping the insides for a american genesis internals.
retrogametech I still use the RF out, as i got a cheap megadrive RF to Scart cable. No modding required, 3.45 on Ebay XD not great, but good enough.
retrogametech Ive seen it, I just prefer to have full manual control over my settings :P .
retrogametech i was gonna buy the 3rd model....
retrogametech Im a fan of how I installed the switches in my Mega Drive. I used slider switches like you did, but I used really small ones which fit perfectly (vertically) in the space between the EXT port and RF jack on the back. You can cant even see them, and regionlanguageswitching can easily be done by with just your index and middle fingers :D
retrogametech The rocker switches look a little bigger next to the sliders but theyre more or less the same depth. Im sure theyd fit in a model 2 no problem. Their pins are also easily bent should space be an issue. The way I see it, a console isnt a member of my family UNTIL its been modded! :P
retrogametech With the model 2 mega drive you can can get a switchless mod for 5060 hz. All done on the reset button, I have the type of mod on my Saturn, snes. Consolepassion .co.uk do these mods. They do the mod to force the dreamcast to play all none 60 hz games at full screen.
retrogametech Thanks for the heads up. Unfortunately my PC isnt really powerful enough for modern gaming. Sounds like a excellent deal though! I take it youre all over it? haha
retrogametech I still have my original SNES, but its finicky, and I could make it work like new, but I already replaced the cartridge slot in a better looking, minimally yellowed SNES I bought at a thrift store, so Im just holding onto my SNES for nostalgias sake, I suppose.
retrogametech Awesome video as ever Martin. I dig the High Definition Graphics Model 1 :) I was looking for one of those when I picked up my Model 1 earlier this year but couldnt find one. They are getting harder to pick up.
retrogametech Top work as always Fella, Ive been thinking about them switches for a long time to use on my project, simple But effective Two thumbs up
retrogametech I do love it, but I only use the Model 2 Megadrive, for one great reason. I muuuuch prefer the model 2 Sega CD, as it was a top loader and I love top loaders! If I could find the block to make it work nicely with a megadrive 1 I would, but until then, Ill stick to my model 2s :P
retrogametech Love the switches  you may start a trend
retrogametech I have the mk 1 megadrive and still use the RF out
retrogametech Yes, you are correct. But, in order for this to work you must also have the MCD powered up to get audio, even if only playing the MD. I play my MCD so infrequently that I prefer to keep it disconnected it from the PSU. Its more convenient for me (less wiresmess) to get my audio directly from the MD as this is what I mostly play. If I feel like playing MCD, I also have the correct mixer patch cable and phono adapters required should I need them. But yes, you are correct in your theory :).
retrogametech A Mega Drive 1 only passes mono sound to the Mega CD. So without using a mixer cable the LR outputs on the Mega CD wont be stereo.
retrogametech I have always used the slide type for this type of mod, wonder how well the rocker ones would fit in a model 2 sega genesis. Totally agree, there is no reason to use RF these days. Only console I cant bring myself to mod is my atari : Its a member of the family and modding a member of your family just seems... wrong. LOOKS GREAT BTW! :)
retrogametech That is a good idea to use stereo at the back, i actually broke my headphone jack when i was hoovering around and i hit the audio cable at the front, i had to solder a new 3.5mm jack in place. I have a bunch of toggle switches but those kind look a lot neater, how did you cut out the slot for the switches as with the toggles ones its just a simple drill through and use the nut to secure it. I have a game Zero Tolerance that you can use the EXT port to hook up 2 Megadrives for multiplayer.
retrogametech So will you be selling that modded mega drive? If so I would be interested )
retrogametech The rocker switches looks way better. Ive never liked the metal toggle switches on modded consoles either  just looks weird. The sliders are ok, but those rockers switches just fit so well.
retrogametech To cut the holes I first drill out the center and then use mini files to file out the shape I want. Didnt know that about the serial port. I love to test that out some time!
retrogametech Overclocking only messes things up if its done to an extreme degree. If youre just overclocking a 7MHz processor for a Mega Drive to think its a 10MHz processor, all it would really do is prevent lag in some games.
retrogametech I just make do with the cheapo 30W units from ebay. You can spend a lot more if you want precision control over temperature but the cheap units will also get the job done :)
retrogametech Where did you get the 10mhz oscillators? Ive been looking for them for what seems like forever.
retrogametech Youre much better off with either the Mk1 or Mk2 models. The Genesis 3 was actually manufactured by Majesco and not Sega. Its missing a lot of the features from previous Mega DriveGenesis. Some games are not compatible, missing ports and mono sound etc. Mk2 is the best option if youre tight on space.
retrogametech Thats pretty much been proven to be the worst Genesis ever made. The model 1 usually has the best sound quality (Like, by a pretty huge difference, you can hear a comparison on Wikipedia). However some of the later Model 1s have the same motherboard as the Model 2s, so you gotta be careful about how the ports are arranged at the back. The Model 2s have the best video quality, with brighter colors and such. But audio and build quality arent as good as Model 1s.
retrogametech How come you dont just use the LR audio outputs from the MegaCD? figured those cables were just for people running 32X without the CD
retrogametech I got mine on ebay for about 2.50 I think.
retrogametech Dumbarton guy here :) love yer vid makes me wish i could solder better than i can, id love tae dae some of yer wee mods lol one ill find a good vid tut on soldering
retrogametech Your offthecuff videos and easy manner are one of the many reasons why I love your videos. Also, replacing the RF output with a 3.5mm output is a GREAT IDEA! I hate seeing the cable hanging off the front of my Genesis!
retrogametech or i could buy 1 send to you and pay for conversion and postage how that be:)
retrogametech This reminds me, I have one of the early ones and the output is scrambled and glitchy, Im baffled by it. If I put up a video, can you have a look please? Itd be much appreciated mate. Thanks
retrogametech My PC isnt that great, could probably run a couple of them but at low quality settings and res. But I thought I may as well order the games, just keep them in my steam account until I upgrade the PC
retrogametech Nice Martin! I like the low profile and color of the rocker switches.
retrogametech great videos. Ive just got myself a Mk. 1 Mega Drive and wanted to install the Jap, 5060 and audio mod. Is there any chance you will do any tutorials for these? Youll be a lot easier to follow than some of the ones on you tube i have come across. If not if you could point me in the right direction. I was also looking at you rca mod but wanted to ask if i should do that or just get the scart cable which i heard was better?
retrogametech They might but Ive never seen any small enough that have that feature.
retrogametech this made my birthday a good one:D
retrogametech I prefer the slide switches but youre right the rocker type are much easier to fit. I had a single rocker on my Mega Drive II (which is a bit longer than yours) and my main Saturn is done with slide switches. I managed to pick up a triplepole quadthrow for the Saturn so I have EUUSJP all set via a single slide switch and a second slide switch for 5060hz I did these quite a few years ago now, probably around 10. I am going to do some more simple modding soon and probably put some vids up
retrogametech Martin, in theory shouldnt the MD stereo out run into the mix port of the Mega CD, then the stereo out of the Mega CD into the 32X?
retrogametech As a fellow Scot I have to say his accent is pretty mild and to me he speaks clearly, get your ears tested :)
retrogametech Those switches look pretty nice. I always thought those switches were just ONOFF not ONOFFON. I couldnt agree more with the RF out. Nobody should need to use that anymore so why not just use the space for something useful.
retrogametech i like that you used the rocker switch over the metal toggle switches that you usually see on modded systems...ive always hated the way they look and never wanted to do any mods that required switches because of them....it seems so obvious to just use another type but it just never really dawned on me so now i might actually do some mods.
retrogametech If Martyn aka retro game tech doesnt have the time, ill gladly do one as long as I can find my camera :)
retrogametech I see a lot of them on ebay really cheap so its worth taking a quick look there :) . I found mine on there boxed for 12 delivered!
retrogametech If I was to mod a console, Id mod one that is in bad condition (gouges, scrapes, dents, etc..). I wouldnt like to ruin a nice one. My yellowed SNES with a cracked shell would be fine for modding.
retrogametech Thanks dude. The overclock mod isnt really needed but it is fun to mess about with. Youre not missing much :P . The 5060Hz mod on the other hand is essential IMO. Such a big difference! :)
retrogametech The Model 1 is the best looking one! Has the best sound too.
retrogametech The overclocking mod is my next project. Have you noticed any issues using an overclocked megadrive on a mega cd? I would assume all would be well if you switch off the 10mhz so it runs as standard?
retrogametech You inspire me to buy soldering irons and dremels. Have you ever seen the wireless irons?
retrogametech liking the background music
retrogametech Are there any mods or repairs you preferably enjoy do over others?
retrogametech You have inspired me to install a 3.5mm audio jack on the back of my Genesis.
retrogametech beautiful.. the pinnacle of mega drive gaming. ive got all that pimpage except for the over clock. damn shame the region lock out on later games prohibits full screen switching (with my types of switches anyway)
retrogametech I appreciate the feedback but my videos are, for the most part, unscripted low production on the fly vlogs about my hobbies and interests. What you see is what you get and this is how I am in real life. If youre looking for high production content with a paid presenter wholl clearly enunciate every word, you might want to look somewhere else.
retrogametech HAHA, yeah normally I see it like that, but I have had that particular Atari since 1979 :P
retrogametech Not so much these days.
retrogametech Your hand shakes a lot man. Might need to check your blood sugar.
retrogametech Have you seen the single switch jap eng  5060hz mod? Ive done it to two megadrives now,  it works a treat. You obviously know your stuff, so have I missed something in this mod which means my consoles are about to melt down?
retrogametech Martin, by MDF do you mean Medium Density Fibrewood because if you do, that is the best plan to give yourself cancer ever, MDF is carcenogenic.
retrogametech Looks cool, cant wait to see the finish product!
retrogametech Good luck I tried to make one a few years ago and I just gave up it was way to much for me but I wish you luck
retrogametech Its going to look great!
retrogametech Excellent update! Cant wait to see more updates as the project progresses.
retrogametech Amazing project, I really cant wait to see the update...
retrogametech Is HDMI not a popular video output over there? RGB SCART cablesconnectors just seem really bulky.
retrogametech Thanks dude. Im going to try and keep on top of this project and make regular updates :)
retrogametech As someone who has painted MDF, Id say dont bother. The edges of the MDF will soak up the paint and it will look terrible. Id get a roll of stickybacked vinyl and cover it with that instead. Its resilient and looks professional (and would match your plastic bezel).
retrogametech How Bout A GamecubeNES Fusion Console Mod. Its Been A Few Months Now.
retrogametech Lol, yeah just a few months :P. It still sits half complete in my cupboard, haha. Maybe it can be my new year resolution to finish it.
retrogametech are you gonna put like cool custom stickkers on the carts because they dont look too nice since they only have the name on top in black and white and no art since they are always in the cabinet
retrogametech Looks like your project is coming along nicely, will be interesting to see your progress on the next update.
retrogametech Thanks. I hope it all comes together nicely :)
retrogametech I keep forgetting the part about older systems not being HD, which is where the confusion came from, lol.
retrogametech damn your videos are full of information keep up the good work.
retrogametech Nice layout Martin. Cant wait to see the final product..:)
retrogametech Very nice.... I need to get the finger out also.. Ive found a friend who is willing to make me a wooden encasing.. just need to get all the pieces altogether :) I also agree with the supergun approach.. no need to solder right onto the jamma connector like some others do.. where did you get all the different sockets and that? (scarts, jacks, controller port) ebay?
retrogametech I was thinking the same thing, keeping the metal around the controller ports will be much stronger than the plastic and you could even sand and spray it black so you cant see it from the outside.
retrogametech Nice project! I am going to follow this. BTW, that BIOS, or atleast that matchbox came from Finland. :D
retrogametech First off, thank you for replying (Im a big fan) and I know its only a small risk but its still a risk and Id hate to have to see my favourite youtuber go through any pain, anyway good luck with the NeoGeo and remember to wear a mask.
retrogametech How come the MVS can simply run off a 9v AC adaptor, yet all these custom superfund Ive seen need those massive PC power adapters?
retrogametech I really like the size of that version MVS board man. Very interested to see how the controller ports and final product looks. Cool stuff man :)
retrogametech Thanks! No doubt Ill need it! :P
retrogametech This will look brilliant youre using some quality parts there. RetroSwede has fitted a circular rocker onoff switch on his Supergun and I think it looks great. Im currently consolising an older piece of kit an Amstrad PCW computer from 1985, Im gonna call it a CPCW now :)
retrogametech Nice plan you put together. Following with interest :) Cheers James
retrogametech I just thought of a really racist way of telling what region you have the consol is. O for your region and  for Japan.
retrogametech why remove the metal from the controller ports? everything else sounds solid.
retrogametech mame, winkawaks, uh... used to be some old dos one but he never updated it.
retrogametech Awesome brand new video
retrogametech cool video, nice to see that you also picked up one of these multicarts, itts gonna save you a lot of money and pluggingunplugging cartridges :D i would also just go with the RGB scart output, the picture should be great and it should be all fine ) some people just go crazy with putting in to many videooutputs x.X
retrogametech thanks for the mention man:) looks like its coming together nicely. Cant wait to see how it turns out. nice work on the sketches too they look awesome!
retrogametech Good project! SCARTRGB is the perfect choice for television. But can you add also a VGA output?
retrogametech cant wait to see it in all its glory!
retrogametech Thanks for the tips Ed. I think cutting the MDF clean and accurate is going to be my biggest challenge. Ideally I should use a table saw but unfortunately I dont have access to something like that. Im going to have to do a lot of sanding I think! Im surprised you havent gone down the CMVS route yet! :P At least you have your fancy AES to play Neo Geo on!
retrogametech I work in a electronic assembly factory. MDF has nothing on the lead I am expose to on a daily basis. I have little fear of the material as well. Not like your eating it or breathing the stuff. Also a good idea to have on eye protection its nasty stuff to get in your eyes.
retrogametech Haha, one (actually probably several) of the many variations of KOF. I didnt notice it at first but one day I happened to glance at the background during a fight. Naked ladies all of the place!!! lol I cant remember the exact ROM but Im pretty sure theres a few like that, haha. I think Gamester81 mentioned it on a review he did of his MVS multicart a while back.
retrogametech Its all coming together.
retrogametech Thanks. I was watching RetroSwedes project vid the other day. Looks like his SuperGun is coming along nicely. Ill need to stop by your channel and check out your Amstrad project :)
retrogametech Looking sweet dude. Defo going to be keeping an eye on these VLOGs :D
retrogametech Ah, yeah, that makes sense.
retrogametech Hi just wanted to know how you connected jamma to scart Do tv s in the UK accept 15khz
retrogametech lol nice, maybe ill be able to find that game too bad that there are like 40 versions of kof on that card x.X
retrogametech scart is still confusing to me. why couldnt they just use different connectors for each thing? i am sure there are just as many people that dont know what connection is going through that connector as there would be on different connectors.
retrogametech I could but theres really no need since I wouldnt use it :P.
retrogametech I live in England, And HDMI cables are popular, but only on HD outputting systems. Scart is easy to use for console collectors as you can get large Scart adapters to plug about 3 Scart plugs in one plug, and you can daisy chain them to make them longer. Scart is also neater, as you dont have 35 separate wires, just one plug. So HDMI is popular, and Every single HD outputting product in my you has HDMI (Bluray players, PS3, Xbox ect).
retrogametech Thats a pretty coll idea :)
retrogametech nice you do what I do some sketches. But the differences is mine is a MV 1C.
retrogametech OOOOHHHHH!!! You gotta get one of those RGBscart to hdmi converter boxes. I use an upscaling one with my dreamcast. If you can modify the RGB upscaler to fit inside your console (and not need the AC adapter), youll have the most badass 1080p MVS console ever! Also you can play your MVS on Pal and NTSC tvs if you do the upscaler mod
retrogametech haha nice pirate cart there, 161 in 1, lol.
retrogametech Im sure it is, but the thing about SCART is that (from what i know) it isnt HD, so they probably do use Component and HDMI a lot, but then again im not too sure. Given that an MVS isnt a modern HD arcade board, SCART is probably a lot better than Composite or SVideo. Plus most TVs should have SCART inputs in Europe.
retrogametech SCART connections seem to be incredibly versatile, I wish it had been adopted in the U.S. MDF takes paint very well, and allows for a nice finish. Youll need to paint your multicart black as well ) I was hoping you would add something to protect the front panel. MDF looks nice when it is painted, but it is not terribly durable. Now I want a CMVS :(
retrogametech Maybe instead of removing the metal of the controller ports just cut off the boltscrew parts leaving the metal surrounds then mount on the mdf or the plastic panel which ever way you choose, that way the metal will be flush with the wood or plastic and will be much stronger. :)
retrogametech Looking good dude, personally I would vinyl wrap it in black as the finish would look better than a paint job.
retrogametech Looking good so far, keep up the good work. One day i hope to build my own console.
retrogametech I want to do this, hopefully I can once I get my CNC and make it soo pretty. Awesome work man!
retrogametech RGB scart has been around for 30 years. HDMI has not... When your dealing with hardware from the 80s its not going to have HDMI
retrogametech wowowowow! wait explicit content wich i have not seen yet? OO in wich game? :D
retrogametech HDMI is common and standard for all modern digital devices nowadays. Scart is what was common and standard for older devices before HDMI that output an analogue signal. Scart can carry different types of video and audio signal and is extremely versatile.
retrogametech Great video. Just started one of these myself, would be great to see an update when you get time )
retrogametech monitoring the process...
retrogametech Ive seen a few people starting similar projects on here, yours looks like its going to be nice, looking forward to seeing the finished product mate. Wish i could do stuff like that.
retrogametech its gonna look awesome! i look forward to seeing it finished! great work dude:)
retrogametech MDF is a low risk material IMO. The dust poses a health risk but this is true of most wood based building materials. Its the formaldehyde resins used in MDF that people have concerns about. However, wearing a dust mask and working in a ventilated area should be more than enough to keep you safe. Ive worked with MDF for years, Im not concerned. I bet a lot of the furniture and units in your homeschoolcollegework are made out of MDF :P
retrogametech was waiting for this one! Looking forward to see it completed Martin! It will be great as always!
retrogametech No worries dude! Managed to remember the numbers from your username and everything, haha! Thanks for the tips! :)
retrogametech Will you be doing a follow up video to this any time soon?
retrogametech Thanks dude. Haha, I noticed you had one of these same carts sitting in your cab in a recent video. Theyre awesome! But some of those ROM hacks are pretty explicit! ( . Y . ) lol. Yeah, going to keep it simple and clean. No point in extra outputs when its custom built for my personal needs :) .
retrogametech Large rubber feet make every project classy.
retrogametech Thanks! Itll be tricky to getting the finish I want but hopefully itll all look good in the end :)
retrogametech Lol, you could make it portable
retrogametech Good luck with it Martian!!
retrogametech Great vid as always, and what a great project. Cant wait to see this finished.
retrogametech Hi there m8 I love your channel and videos. I have a problem with my Dreamcast, It starts up, shows the Dreamcast logo and the screen goes blank. some guys say its the fan that needs replacing. I need some help as you have dealt with many consoles m8. Thank You
retrogametech No bad man!! Also, no sure if theres a lot of variation in models, but I looked this video up to clean up the Dreamcast my missus got from eBay. On oor wan, you need to remove the fan with the motherboard or it wont come out. Have you came across this similar variant before yersel?
retrogametech phillips head screw driver
retrogametech Gigabyte Disc. It has a small inner section that is like a normal CD (Where the audio cd warning tracks and sometimes bonus art materials hide), surrounded by a larger, higher density section where the games are. All those people that ripped their Dreamcast discs to ISOs? They had to use a Dreamcast itself to do that, over network or serial port, nothing else will read the entire disc.
retrogametech Thanks for such a good video showing how easy it would be to repairreplace.
retrogametech Maybe it looks like its orange but its red?
retrogametech I always do that too!
retrogametech facepalm yes for online what else would it be used for
retrogametech The earlier revisions of Dreamcast had large metal heatsinks, heat pipes and metal fan housings. They were more commonly found in Japanese systems but they were released in all regions. VA0 is the motherboard version you are looking for.
retrogametech i did that when i took apart my laptop. only had 1 screw left and was for shielding. think might have put a wrong screw someplace maybe because the one was too small it seemed which is why didnt go.
retrogametech I do that but I went and got a big sheet of low magnetic stuff. The sort used for fridge magnets. I just place them all on it and they dont go anywhere.
retrogametech I have the blue Japanese dreamcast I am never going to take that apart
retrogametech Taking apart the dreamcast?
retrogametech The Saturn is actually very similar in design. Maybe in future I do the same for the Saturn. It sounds like you either have a bad cable or just need to resolder the the AV port to the motherboard.
retrogametech OFFICIAL RETROGAMETECH DREAMCAST DISASSEMBLE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP :p please make that happen :D
retrogametech My Dreamcast has an orange swirl and Im American.
retrogametech wolf whistles heyyy sexiiiiiiii
retrogametech To repair it, mod it, clean it or maybe just for fun to see how it works and whats inside. Same reasons youd take anything apart. :P
retrogametech in his defense, it could have been used for like direct dialup (your dreamcast calls your friends dreamcast using yoru phone number) or dialing up an old special BBS system that didnt actually connect to the internet.
retrogametech Lol, I was hoping it might get a few laughs :)
retrogametech Question: Not trying to sound cocky or anything but why would you do this?
retrogametech Its a plastic piece of plastic!!!!!! yayyy!!!!!
retrogametech What exactly are you referring to?
retrogametech man i love these videos, please never stop!
retrogametech The title of this is misleading, you never took your clothes off.
retrogametech Yeah me too, why the hell do you type like that btw?
retrogametech Think youre up for the challenge, Ed? :P
retrogametech thats ok until you knock them all to fook by accident
retrogametech Very nice, you probably made the 5 minute goal just you were explaining where screws are etc. Anyhow, love how easy the Dreamcast is :)
retrogametech I like the design of Dreamcasts internals, its very neat and logical.
retrogametech It is really important to keep your screws organized, even moreso for the Dreamcast. Its easy to say, mount the GDROM with a screw that appears to be the same size, but is really a millimeter or two longer. It will bore down into the pcb where theres a densely packed area of traces going into the GPU and just cut through a bunch of them. I remember seeing a few people do this years ago, and the gore photos were displeasant to say the least.
retrogametech If thats the case then Im slightly worried about what exactly you were expecting to see me do. :P
retrogametech Nice breaking down of the DC. Very informative :)
retrogametech No, Dreamcast uses a proprietary format called Gigabyte Disc (also sometimes called GigaDisk). So in this case its a GDROM not CDROM.
retrogametech No problem :) . Hope it helps a few people out.
retrogametech hi thanks for getting back to me . i will try what you have said. look forward to watching the Saturn video when you put it up. thanks again. regards Steve.
retrogametech Ok, Im confused... my NA model DC has an orange logo on it (pulled it out to verify,) or, is it more blatantly orange for the Japanese model, and more red for North America?
retrogametech i like your enthusiasm
retrogametech I Place My Screws Down On A Flat Surface In The Pattern They Were In, In The Console.
retrogametech sweat band for added suspense
retrogametech GDROM? did you mean cdrom?
retrogametech Lol, the AfterBurner theme fit so well!
retrogametech awesome you took stripped that down like a boss , your videos are really top notch :)
retrogametech You should have directly challenged people to beat your time :)
retrogametech Very good video and well done so that people can pause it at stages to make the tear down easy.
retrogametech Excellent video. Also good to notice a screwdriver with magnetic tip helps tons.
retrogametech Thanks for watching and commenting :)
retrogametech didnt japan have the RED logo orange is U.S. logo i got 2 of em im pretty sure lol
retrogametech i can tell that is a version 0 too because of the heat pipes. i have a 0 and a 1. i dont know how you use ice trey like that. seems harder to know where each ones goes like that.
retrogametech I believe you can make and use substances like Retr0bright to restore old systems. But Its not something Ive ever tried myself.
retrogametech I bet I could probably do it in 3 and a half to 4 :P . Ive fixed so many of these things over the years I honestly could do this blindfolded, haha.
retrogametech anybody else use ice cube trays on all their projects now...aha
retrogametech thanks for the video yet again u have made an excellent video :)
retrogametech they way it should be...
retrogametech Nothing If Foolproof. Happened With One Of My GBA SPs.
retrogametech i did this before. it really isnt hard but a lot of screws.
retrogametech Thanks dude. Yeah those screwdrivers come in really handy sometimes. Makes the job that bit easier! :)
retrogametech smash shift for a few seconds to turn off sticky keys that shit is fucking annoying to read on youtube
retrogametech i reckon you can shave 2 mins off it if you had to.maybe youll start console stripping speedrun craze lol
retrogametech Martin, another great video. Thanks for uploading this. And... yes, please, we would love to see a Saturn strip down video made by you. Its great to understand all the components of a console, at the hands of someone else who is more competent in stripping them down. Im always fearful of breaking things when Im venturing into new territory. But after I understand them better, Im already thinking of some great mods to be made.
retrogametech Thanks Martin, really enjoyed this!
retrogametech im loving the title haha
retrogametech Once again, another fascinating video...thanks brother!
retrogametech How hard easy is it to mod the dreamcast to run at 60 hz full screen.
retrogametech Dreamcast pit stop :P . Sega had some great designers and hardware engineers.
retrogametech Me Too But I Really Dont Like Typing Like This so I think Ill stop.
retrogametech Bad Habit, I Can Never Remember Which Words I Should Be Capitalizing, So I Just Capitalize Them All.
retrogametech Seeing a Dreamcast thats old enough for a retrobrite treatment makes me feel well old
retrogametech lol i only could imagine seeing you using a powertool on that thing.... bwwwtbwwwtbwwwwt... taking that baby apart in about a minute OO nice job though i always loved the dreamcast for its component design wich allows you to very easily to take it apart or replace something )
retrogametech :D its one of those thing that changes your life ! theirs no going back now aha i actually went out to buy an ice tray specifically!
retrogametech and how fast with a de magnetized driver? :P
retrogametech hi great video of the strip down of the dream cast. will you be doing a video of a Saturn strip down and an av mod. as i have a Saturn which as a faulty TV connection . if i wiggle the lead color on game gos all wiered. thanks regards Steve.
retrogametech LIKE A BOSS!!!! :D:D:D
retrogametech That PAL Dream cast is in need of a deep cleansing with some Retr0brite
retrogametech Your sega looks like it could take over the world lol :)
retrogametech According to the stats at current You could be making from 6,100  15,100 US per year. but keep it mind it fluctuates. Go for it !
retrogametech Lol, I appreciate it dude! Youre usually one of the first people to watchcomment on my vids. Thanks for the support! :)
retrogametech venga boys vs steps lol. that sounds like the devils music, ozzys sacked ) somehow it works tho.. lol. great find on the infrared controllers. yea they do usually go for a pretty penny. some cool stuff there dude..
retrogametech Martin, youre spot on in regards to the Space Harrier BGM. I think thats probably the western release of the early Sega Ages 2500 games that were developed by the second party 3DAges  which explains why they veer from the original games to such a degree.
retrogametech Ouch that Space Harrier music is awful! I almost started laughing as soon as the clip started. The Virtua Racing and Outrun looks great, really smooth running as well. Congrats on the 10k subscribers, you deserve it, one of my favourite gaming channels!
retrogametech If you ever need help getting partnered dude, let me know! You could use the money for future projects! But that Sega Classics collection, the buggers removed Alien Syndrome from the PAL version to lower the age rating .
retrogametech Some interesting pickups there, cool that the Mega Drive wireless controllers are backwards compatible with the Master System. By the way, have you noticed any buffering issues on Youtube over the past few weeks. At certain times of the day quality settings as low as 240p take an age to load. No problems on the iPlayer at same time so must be Youtube specific. If youve had problems google this Oyl8HEc4rHg, should bring you to a Slow buffering google productforum page. Maybe EU server issue?
retrogametech Your videos are the best!!!!
retrogametech Ok, didnt know that thanks!
retrogametech Haha, I find it difficult not to laugh everytime I hear it :P
retrogametech your videos are good you need to make money off them
retrogametech Im experiencing more or less the same thing so I guess we can rule out our ISPs. It seems worse at peak times. Its probably just YouTubes servers struggling with the demand. Ive given up watching vids at 720p unless its outside peak times or something with high production value. But like you, even 360480p vids will struggle to buffer! Its especially annoying if Im trying to watch or listen to a music vid!! Its like having a scratched CD!! lol
retrogametech best space harrier 2 version is on the Saturn, Sega Ages Vol 1, also includes outrun and afterburner 2, also really good versions. the music is damn good in them. highly recommend picking it up if you have a saturn.
retrogametech 11:19......strange a collection without sonic
retrogametech i was going to do the snap shot but had 0 time i think i made 6 attempts at doing a video
retrogametech I actually kinda like it! lol :P . Thanks btw :)
retrogametech You should monetize your channel!
retrogametech Hi, RGT if you ever get your hands on a kinect could you show it being used by windows? I heard you can actually control windows with a kinect.
retrogametech Ever Think Of Trying To Integrate The Wireless Receiver Like You Did With Your Xbox? In My Opinion It Would Certainly Look Nicer.
retrogametech Id actually thought of it but those wireless padsreceivers are so rarevaluable that it would be a real shame to hack them. Im still looking into doing it with a cheap 3rd party adapter though :)
retrogametech I remember way back when, at school. The chav and chavette retards saying my music tape was shit (beasty boys) then later overhearing them discussing how cool the venga bus song was. UGH.
retrogametech You should replace the sega channel cart with the power base converter and a master system game!
retrogametech The games on Sega Ages Vol1 for the Saturn are arcade perfect ports from what I understand. Thats why theyre so good! :) Got me a copy of that compilation a while back for that very reason XD
retrogametech I got a reply :D Thank you :)
retrogametech That poor Mega Drive, as if getting all the other ports filled wasnt degrading enough. I love Shadow Dancer! I hate that it was not released in US. I dont think I have ever seen a F1 car drift like that...but I would pay money to see someone do it. That Space Harrier music is...intersting?
retrogametech Im from portugal, im not really into N gage games, but ill see what i can do. If I do find the game, i can send it to you if you pay postage.
retrogametech I completely agree with the description of the Space Harrier music.
retrogametech Thanks for the nice comment! XD
retrogametech I have the wireless mega drive controllers. They work amazingly well. I ended up opening mine up and sticking a couple of 2p pieces in each of the grips of the controller to add a bit of weight.
retrogametech Thanks Ed! I might do some waffles in future. I have a few topics Id quite like to discuss so maybe Ill give it a trial run :). I love how the Mega Drive is looking! haha. I just need to track down that japanese modem attachment and the transformation will be complete! What did you think of the Sega collection? I love that Golden Axe remake. And the music in Outrun is cheesy as hell! XD Just need a copy of Sega Rally on Ngage to have a complete worldwide collection. One day!....
retrogametech the golden axe remix looks quality haha might look out for that ive just starting picking up ps2 games, and also original xbox games(again) your setup is quality, i had a set of wireless controllers for the master system although they died long ago, not sure if they worked on the megadrive also but they had C buttons and were megadrive shaped think i have the reciever around somewhere. and oooh jesus that space harrier music is pure cheddar cheese
retrogametech That space harrier music is a lot like Aqua as well :P
retrogametech Why dont you monetize your videos...you fool. On a serious note...you should offer your services or some kind of merchandise so we can help support your habits. :D
retrogametech Agreed, Sega Ages has my favourite versions of Space Harrier, Afterburner II and Outrun, so much infact that I picked up the Japanese Saturn versions of Outrun and Afterburner II yesterday. They shouldve kept Outruns arrange soundtrack and Afterburners soundtrack with melodies in Sega Ages Vol.1
retrogametech If you look on eBay now theres a sealed US version of Civilization for Ngage for 63 BIN or bidding starts at 50, plus 7 postage, dont know if thats the one you saw or if its new. Jus thought Id mention it!
retrogametech Its weird how people know Martin from Luke but with me its the other way round XD
retrogametech Thanks, thats cool to know :)
retrogametech Thanks! The new cover seems to work pretty well :)
retrogametech RetroGameTech Would The Third Party Adapters Work With The Original Controllers?
retrogametech You seem Like a nice person, I think you present in a very well thought out and well spoken manner. You seem like the kind of person i would become fast friends with. Well who knows right? I have no idea if your open to making friends through youtube? If you do feel like making a friend I would be happy to chat and talk games.
retrogametech 16:05 this music reminds me of a Wii Shop Channel game I played. With a 3dTetris type of thing. I think it was called thruspace.
retrogametech I really like the Golden Axe remake! Its so cheesy! XD
retrogametech Congrats on 10K subs and 3 million views! Your commitment to providing quality content is impeccable I dont think many people would burn themselves while making a video, and still worry about having the right angle. :)
retrogametech them pads look ace, i cant play my md when my 2 yr old is around cos she grabs the wires! I want to play that golden axe remix. It looks great. I love seeing the fake GBA carts. Good vid as usual(after id skipped the waffle lol).
retrogametech Man you were not joking with the StepsVengaboys mashup music lol terrible!
retrogametech you should monetize your vids. even a few extra quid here and there could beef up your collection. well as long as gits like me arent using adblock
retrogametech Thanks Luke! It was kinda crazy after you posted up that reply, haha. I appreciate you taking the time to do that!
retrogametech The collection is worth 5 of anyones money for that Golden Axe remake alone! :)
retrogametech Jesus christ 10k subs, I thought you were niche dude but you bloody went Hollywood without me noticing :D Congrats!
retrogametech My god the MegaDrive looks hurrendous with all the attachments on it :) haha! Poor thing but awesome video as ever Martin.
retrogametech congrats too on 10k subs and the last n gage game!!
retrogametech Wow I had no idea they remade space Harrior. But Im from the US so I probably wont be able to play this. XD
retrogametech Awesome! Good to see those wireless controllers in a collectors hands who could bring them back to life. Nice job with the DVD cover plastic though :P
retrogametech thanks for the shout out dude! was fun to make a response! no ginger cat pick up? lol cool u picked up sega classic collection! i picked that up a few years aga ar car boot! only played out run your vid will make me play it again! great work dude:)
retrogametech congrats on the 10k subs! keep it up your videos are the best!!
retrogametech The Sega Classics collection should be on Xbox Arcade.
retrogametech I thought it was probably a combination of my ISP (O2) and YouTube messing with their buffering settings. I noticed recently that some videos wont continue bufferingloading in the background if you pause them. It might continue downloading an extra 30sec of video but then stops until you hit play again. I was thinking it was maybe an attempt to curb wasted bandwidth? i.e. people watching half a vid then clicking on something else?
retrogametech I actually own the 6 button wireless controllers with the receiver. They still work great. I like them better then the original 3 button controller. The d pad is much better and not stiff.
retrogametech Luke is awesome!!! Happy 10k martin!!
retrogametech Thanks you! :) Just need that copy of Sega Rally! :P
retrogametech I got a good deal on my sega genesis wireless controllers, too. I got one controller and the reciever in a lot of 20 Broken genesis controllers for about 20 shipped. I tried them and all of the controllers worked except two third party controllers.
retrogametech Thanks! And yeah this version of Space Harriers always makes me laugh. The announcer alone cracks me up XD
retrogametech Bonanza Bros is my favourite megadrive game in that collection and you didnt show it xD but if I can get the collection for 4 I will!
retrogametech Shadow Dancer was released in the US. I have a Sega Classics copy of it.
retrogametech Space Harrier is good :) liked it
retrogametech Been Watching Since August 2010. Looking Forward To Another 2 Years, Cheers!
retrogametech Thats the coldest shout out Ive ever heard. lol
retrogametech Cheers, Luke. Yeah, I somehow managed to snag and partially rip the ribbon cable that connects my cams LCD to the mainboard. Luckily I found a similar but faulty model on ebay which I got really cheap and cannibalising for parts. Saved myself a couple 100 in repair bills! :) Feels great to finally get that last NGage game! :) . But now not having that Australia only Sega Rally release is bothering me, lol. Theres always something! :P
retrogametech XD that do sound up like a mashup of steps and venga boys
retrogametech Great Sunday video ..Enjoyed this. Have an awesome day.
retrogametech nice video, i like the type of videos you make they are quite cool and interesting and make me have a different view on gaming
retrogametech Ive got the SEGA Classics collection on PS2 like you have but I have to use the PCSX2 Emulator on my PC to play it.... I dont have a PS2 anymore nor a PS2 Capable PS3 :(
retrogametech love the space harrier music in this version!! my fav version of the game by far!! subscriber aswell, got that game myself
retrogametech Worked better than I expected! Ghetto solutions FTW! :)
retrogametech RGB SCART looks pretty good still even on a HD LCD TV, but dont know what the poster uses himself
retrogametech Thank you very much. Youre really good at it, amd your tutorial is very helpful. It will help me a lot to fix my 3DS.
retrogametech Pretty helpful video. thanks
retrogametech you sir are a master of electronic trickery.
retrogametech you have the same holder as me, mine broke off there too .
retrogametech not bad at all. If you use the braid the beginning you can get to solder off a little easier. If you have a heat gun that allows control of air flow the port will be easier to remove, provided that it can apply as much heat as the iron without all the air. You can presolder the contacts on the board with the flux and the iron. Then use the heat gun to melt the solder when the slot is lined up and its leads will drop into place the second the solder melts. The key is is lots of heat without too much blowing if you can find the right hot air tool. Invest in a hot air heat handle and watch the magic happen.
retrogametech You couldve used a tooth pick instead of a q tip for the smaller parts
retrogametech Im going to try this after I clean the connectors on the game cartridges. They, and the pins on the consoles are corroded, so I hope thats the only thing I have to do. Ive got 2 different DSs to work on. Fun, Fun!
retrogametech what type of desoldering paste is acceptable
retrogametech Where exactly do you buy your replacement parts?
retrogametech where can i get one of those gameslot things?
retrogametech Did you fixed the black screen of death?
retrogametech Good job mate, excellent stuff!
retrogametech Very helpful. Thanks man!
retrogametech Is it a better idea to remove the mobo from the console before working on it, or does it not matter?
retrogametech Nice one dude you have helped me de solder a card slot on a ds lite i know there not the same but the card slots arent to far off. Superb, keep up the good work.
retrogametech The cutting board? You can pick those up in most 1 shops. I cant remember the exact name, other than cutting board :P
retrogametech Do more of these please.
retrogametech Tell me about it :P, I got mine as a birthday present (I have the XL model).
retrogametech So the cover to the motherboard is just crosshead screws and not Nintendobits? So If i only had two small connectors inside the cartridge bay bent, then I should be able to band them back into place right? Can I reinforce them with solder or electrical tape?
retrogametech Exactly! probably those pesky kids :P
retrogametech Will this be more or less the same with the XL?
retrogametech Be sure that the game is in your region, 3ds is region locked
retrogametech Yeah, sadly the pips in this one were too far gone to repair. Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Ayo i got a ds lite for u to fix
retrogametech Great video thanks for takeing time out to do this for everyone :)
retrogametech I have a problem. My nin dsi xl wont read my pokemon heart gold what do I do?
retrogametech I absolutely love you and your content, Cant stop watching !!. Dont know how I didnt find out about you bedore !
retrogametech Love your teardownsDIY fixes videos, splendid channel man. Do you know of any other pages like Dealextreme?
retrogametech Thanks, Ill try my best!
retrogametech Lol, something like that :P
retrogametech Nintendo should put on the advert ITS NOT A CUP!!!
retrogametech Does anyone have a 3DS for sale on here?
retrogametech Awesome... (Also, I need to work on my soldering skills so that I can do this replacement easily.) Theres this guy in my local chinatown that repairs and resolders old and new consoles. He always has a few 3DSes. :D
retrogametech game is broken, or spark or worst, a big kaboom
retrogametech Wish i could solder like that, i always screw it up. Hell, i killed 2 xboxs trying to get a modchip in. I gave up and found a 1.5 on the ebay and got that.
retrogametech Thank you, Ill try to make more of these.
retrogametech Thank you!, glad you enjoyed it :)
retrogametech i just enjoyed watching a video about soldering. some things can only happen in Glasgow... another great video mate, cheers, ashton lane rulezzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
retrogametech Awesome... (Also, I need to work on my soldering skills so that I can do this replacement easily.) Theres this guy in my local chinatown that repairs and resolders old and new consoles. He always has a few 3DSes. :D
retrogametech Every solder based repair requires a beep button... doesnt matter how careful you are, I recommend getting drunk beforehand and caring less... however that time I not only grabbed the tip and dropped it on my leg, disproves my advice.
retrogametech game is broken, or spark or worst, a big kaboom
retrogametech Wish i could solder like that, i always screw it up. Hell, i killed 2 xboxs trying to get a modchip in. I gave up and found a 1.5 on the ebay and got that.
retrogametech Thank you, Ill try to make more of these.
retrogametech Thank you!, glad you enjoyed it :)
retrogametech Wow I cant believe you touched the soldering gun, it really burns (that actually happened to me before when I was trying to replace the joysticks on my Gamecube Controller).
retrogametech Can you put videos into playlists for each system please?
retrogametech Thanks :) . Nah it was just a very light 1st degree burn. Its all good.
retrogametech If you mean the cartridge slot, imagine youre 3DS laying on the table, someone spills some water or something, and it flows into the slot.
retrogametech i dont think that they work really well with surface mounted stuff.
retrogametech Thanks for the vid, helped out alot.
retrogametech 13:29 It like you just stabbed yourself with the iron lol.
retrogametech Best video yet. Awesome job mate.
retrogametech love your videos sorry for the wd40 cartridge comment
retrogametech Do you by chance know of anyway to fix a 3DS that randomly turns off? There are some suggestions on the internet but none of them worked. I bought it off eBay as a fixer (watching you inspired me to fix stuff and resell them) I took a chance on it being there wasnt any pictures and it was barely touched. I only paid 40 for it so it was pretty cheap. Hoping you have some suggestion if you even read this since the video is pretty old. Anyway keep making videos!
retrogametech Thanks. Soldering isnt as hard as some people make out. A little bit of practice on some old hardware and youll be confident in no time! :)
retrogametech wow.. well dayum, you done gone given me somethin to think about... now the question is, do you prefer the original or the XL (if youve tried it yet)? has anyone figured out how to region unlock the 3DS yet? i also get put off by its lack of backward compatibility with the GBA but i know thats a silly reason, especially since you could probably just play every GBA game ever made usin an SD card lol i have seen a vid on the toobs showing a 3DS playin GBA pixel 4 pixel, looked good.
retrogametech Great video, nicely detailed :)
retrogametech Thanks for showing the actual repair! Great job there! Keep em comming....
retrogametech it will fuse and send the wrong signal to the wrong places and damage your 3ds even more
retrogametech I strongly agree with this guy.
retrogametech at 15:05 it sounds like your pulling a sword out lol
retrogametech nice vid...... lol you are like me .... Fixing stuff all the time... btw the tip looked a bit big for the job :D
retrogametech well done fix the 3ds ! why dont you keep hold of it and trade it in as part payment for a wii u! :)
retrogametech Definitely. I had never used a solder wick before I watched this video. Instead, I used a springloaded solder sucker. After watching this, I thought Id give a wick a go and now prefer using it over a sucker.
retrogametech my 3ds shows it reads the game but wont play..even a brand new game oO
retrogametech Thats pretty cool :) . Im glad you got some use out of my channel!
retrogametech Think after watching this I will be wearing gloves when soldering lol! If you do sell it, I would probably sell it on eBay as these are still going for 100 quite easily, especially boxed. Trade in value isnt so great in your case as the 3DS xl sells for 170 in stores, whereas Amazon are still selling it for 158 with a free game.
retrogametech These videos are great! I think Ill subscribe :)
retrogametech Living your work mate. Watching a lot of your videos just now. Old skool gamer and scottish just like myself! Keep up the good work
retrogametech Thanks. Yeah it started out as and still is just a hobby :) .
retrogametech Your post made me laugh really hard, you have a good point
retrogametech Thanks! Yeah the XL seems to have a very nice looking screen. :)
retrogametech Really interesting video :)
retrogametech Haha, now theres an idea for a future video series! I could get totally tanked then set about fixing some stuff on camera. It could be done Steve Benway style  Heres me fixing consoles drunk (badly), just so you can see what it looks like. :P
retrogametech nice video retrogametech. Also whats your progress on your faulty R4s?
retrogametech Thanks. Im never sure if people will like these type of vids or not, haha. But I enjoy watching other people do repairsmods too. You can sometimes pickup tricks you hadnt though of etc. Thanks for watching!
retrogametech eae vc  brasileiro ou portugues ???
retrogametech AMAZING set up mate! unfortunately im unable to find NES games too! i live in melbourne, ive found a couple here and there but i have to mostly get them from ebay!! ive just started collecting and i have to say for a person that lives in australia you have a great collection
retrogametech Yeah its a shame that the older games are impossible to find or expensive, and then our game stores are often littered with shovelware, well it is in Perth at least. And good luck with the collection, its always good to see other people with nice collections out there.
retrogametech epic :D btw your subbed and liked
retrogametech Great setup mate :D are you from the UK
retrogametech Awesome dude sorry it too soooo long to reply had a complete pc meltdown!
retrogametech Thanks dude and yeah I sure am! :D
retrogametech Thanks man! Glad you like it :D and I certainly am from the UK :)
retrogametech Great video bristolian? ?
retrogametech Good to see so many modded consoles! That pirate Famicom game looks pretty interesting, Ill need to check out your other vid. Btw, Im seriously jealous you have that DoA stick! haha Theyre really expensive! Thanks for taking the time to post a response!
retrogametech Thanks Martian! Very rare game actually, luckily some collector wanted to part with it. Hope you enjoy my other video too :). Haha, yep was super expensive  I had to get it though Im a huge DoA fan. No worries man, love your videos!
retrogametech Playstation 3 BluRay playback isnt region free. My BluRay player is.
retrogametech That room looks like one hell of a playground (a good thing), Luke. I love these gaming set up vids and hope you dont mind but I made a real quick vid response of my own set up. Its nothing grand but something I wanted to do for some time.
retrogametech Sweet! You havent had a talk on each system for a while, very nice stuff :) Also check your inbox I made something for you!
retrogametech What a wonderful collection of gaming systems . Thank you very much for keeping this systems live for us .
retrogametech That LaserActive player is cool. Circuit City (remember them) had a dented one for sale years ago for around 1,000! And the modules were around 350 each! Hey, do you have a VHD player? Im into that format now. I imported a National 3D DiscLord PLUS a pair of the 3D Scope headgear. Im still buying LaserDiscs though. My collection is now at 1,034 LDs from the USA, Japan, HK, Netherlands, Germany and the UK. Great vid as usual. STAY AWESOME! :)
retrogametech love your behind scenes videos.
retrogametech Your poor Wii is crushed by those huge consoles and TV, lol. XD
retrogametech He did it! :) Nice 1 Luke!
retrogametech Wish i had one of those super famicom boxes but there too expensive. or the old NES one would be sweet.
retrogametech Do you have time to play those things? Other question i have is do you fix those and sell for profit?
retrogametech im the same i like to switch systems also and always come back to the retro 1s :)
retrogametech Im glad Im not the only one with bugger all space.
retrogametech Nice to see the little glimpse of the Laseractive sir! :)
retrogametech I have a question. You do very well with modding n fixing. My wii all of a sudden wont play vids when i goto youtube. The load but never play. I think it had something to do with the wii update. Any info on how I can rectify this?
retrogametech Very cool video as always.
retrogametech do you still have the Orange Pikachu N64? Id so would you consider selling it? since im after one :3
retrogametech Luke...hey about some shelves and getting nice feel to your collection? or you out of space?)) anyway thanks for your vids...can you make more vids about japanese gaming stores?)
retrogametech Thats the only thing about Japan I think I would dislike, small spaces, Im already enough of a hoarder, if I had less space Id be on TV :) Nice video!
retrogametech I would love to have all of my 20 systems hooked up at once like you guys but unless I can come up with a good way of making it clutter free looking I dont think its going to happen.... My wife would most certainly throw a shit fit.
retrogametech Megaman Anniversary Collection! Awesome!
retrogametech 3 mods. Is your house small? or does your wife not let you have your consoles hooked up everywhere? I know the feeling...I gotta keep all my consoles in their cases and hook em up one at a time because apparently they look ugly.
retrogametech Did you get my PM the other day? Ive still not heard from you.
retrogametech hey luke i have a ps2 slim it loads my games but stops half way on the loading screen if you have any ideas please let me know because i really dont fancy having to pay out for a new one thanks.
retrogametech nice setup, Lukester. I installed homebrew on my wii and now play NES, MAME, Turbo Grafx16, SEga Gensis, SMS, and SNES games on it through emulation. Freaking love it, and it saves a lot of room from all those consoles. Great setup...oh, JAPAN!!!!
retrogametech If its so simple to make a console region free, why dont the producers just so it themselves?
retrogametech Man you and Retro Game tech, always making me jealous... and for real how the hell can I get an xbox mod chip??? I cant for the life of me find anybody who sells them. where do I look?
retrogametech PS2 got a cool softmod a while ago using a gameshark and special disc. I got it on my old phat ps2, plays isos off an hdd. Sure not every single game works but most of the games i own do.
retrogametech Lets be honest here: Your Neo Geo MVS Cabs own all these Consols. Everyone can have those but not the Cabs which are truly amazing.
retrogametech Wow awesome! Now to play some lunar magic school.
retrogametech nice work Luke  youre setup actually always reminds me of Super Potato :D even the shelving looks similiar, and the odd few little LCD screens about the place showing games
retrogametech Really enjoy your videos Luke, it was RetroGameTech who put me onto your channel, him and Classic Games Room :D
retrogametech hey luke do know any solution for ylod ps3?
retrogametech Really appreciate you taking the time to do a video response dude! Ive been having a hard time keeping up with all the comments and new people checking out my channel! haha I dont think I remember seeing one of those DuoR systems before. Ill need to check that out. Thanks again Luke!
retrogametech I used to think martin and you were the same person....It was a long time ago but it is the truth. I didnt used to use youtube with a profile and subscrptions. You are both sincere and talented...
retrogametech i can not call myself a gamer after watching your vids.
retrogametech He is living in Japan.. small housesappartments everywhere!
retrogametech Great setup Luke  kind of makes me regret selling my AES and DuoR now... lol
retrogametech Just wached retrogametechs video and now this popped up in my sub box thanks luke :D
retrogametech Ha, these two appeared right on top of each other in my feed.
retrogametech does the PhilipsCDi 220 have any value at all i just got one for free is it worth anything ?
retrogametech Nice collection of consoles there dude. Personally im a little OCD with presentation, and i couldnt for the life of me leave everything all messy like that, Would defo have to have it all neat and tidy like RetroGameTech does.. But still very cool
retrogametech Excellent response vid. I havent done any mods to my systems yet, but you never know when I might try my hands on the modding business. Love Retrogametechs repair and mod videos.
retrogametech god damn Im so jealous! nice systems man! 1010
retrogametech Pushing Onwards playing in the background (VVVVVV). One of my favorite songs.
retrogametech I was hoping to have it done a while ago but between moving and essays galore I have no time. Ill eventually get to it when ive setup my computer.
retrogametech I just bought a Japanese Sega Saturn and i wonder if i can play Pal games on it with the Action Replay 4M cartridge
retrogametech You could do a series of progress vids as you start to set it all up!
retrogametech Nice setup. Right now Ive got a 2 ps1s, ps2, gamecube, 2 xboxes, 2 xbox 360s and a ps3. Did have an nes, snes, megadrive a few years ago, but some twat broke into my flat and nicked them when I was away one weekend. Got plans to get them all again though.
retrogametech Thanks. Theres really nothing in my setup that would cost a lot to buy. Most of these systems I bought really cheap or faulty on ebay. Just clean them up, do a couple of mods and yourre good to go! :) I have the N64 but was never a big fan. I actually dont like many of the consoles from the era. The PS1, N64 and Saturn for one reason or another never interested me much. I think it was the move away from 2D sprites to the much less attractive (for the time) pologonated 3D environments.
retrogametech Thanks dude! I actually just sold my PSP and UMD collection recently. I picked up a Go instead since you can softmod them. Really compact and great for emus etc :)
retrogametech Dude, quick question, i have a dreamcast keyboard in MINT condition, boxed, with the plastic bag it was inside in the box if you are interested?
retrogametech Argos a couple of years ago. Think it was about 25.
retrogametech Thanks dude! Would love to see. You should definitely make a vid!
retrogametech How do u make ur older consoles look decent on ur tv???
retrogametech NES??? SNES?? GameGear? Loool
retrogametech Thanks dude! Yeah I cant keep anything stock. Ive always got to take things apart, find out how they work, and, most importantly, install blue LEDs :) Btw, you going to be doing your QA responses after youre done moving?
retrogametech sweet thankyou so much for your help dude, lol naah screw compsite i go all out scart because its so much easier, does it have alot of scart plug sockets in that tv then ? because i will have a lot of scarts to plug in haha ! :) and keep up the great work with the videos man i love them all !! :D
retrogametech Do you play any PC games?
retrogametech I really want an original Xbox like yours  Dreamcast
retrogametech Good to see a fellow piratecollector... Just because you have backups doesnt mean you dont buy legit stuff too. Im seriously running out of space.
retrogametech Well, playing nicely into that stereotypical tech geek persona, there is no girlfriend or wife for me to worry about right now, haha. I suppose any future lady friends will either have to be very tolerant or just as geeky as me! :P
retrogametech I used to repair 360s all the time back when they were going through their unreliable phase. Ive never kept a 360 longer than a year or 2 before selling it to buy a newer revision. The later hardware revisions are much better but Id quite like a 4GB slim for the quieter running. Thanks for watching and I appreciate you taking the time comment :).
retrogametech I completely agree... Not to mention I like to wait a few months so the game prices go down to somewhere around 30. I think 60 is absurd for a new game unless you can get 50hrs of good gameplay out of it IE Skyrim, Fallout, GTA, Red Dead Redemption.
retrogametech I just added a response video to show my current setup (WIP). :)
retrogametech Thanks! I got into console modding back in the Xbox 1 days. Before that I way always just taking stuff apart to see how it worked etc. Mostly just self taught, trial and error, internet tutorials etc etc. Region modding the Dreamcast involves some tricky soldering to mount a new BIOS chip onto the old one and lift a few chip legs etc. It really depends on how confident you are with a soldering iron.
retrogametech Subbed recently, by far my favourite channel, so envious of this setup,
retrogametech My setup is a laptop with a load of emulators
retrogametech I dont think you have a video in which you show your whole games collection.
retrogametech Far from it. He pays for his stuff by buying faulty consoles and repairing and selling them on again. Its a self supporting hobby.
retrogametech i cant believe i never saw you responded. HOLY CRAP YOU RESPONDED!!! please make the video on your handhelds. that would be sooooo awesome. bro you are so cool! i watch all your videos. even if i dont like the content, its always a good time listening to your accent haha.
retrogametech You are an inspiration to all collectors including me.
retrogametech Thanks dude! Yeah Shadow Dancer is great! Found that cart on ebay super cheap! :)
retrogametech We have the same TV cabinet thing :D
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech yes! please! im such a huge fan and it would be so great!!!
retrogametech I use all these consoles regularly so theres no point hiding them away in storage. If anything wears out or breaks then Ill just fix or repair it. The ones in storage wouldnt be used very ofteneven so theres no point in having them out on display etc.
retrogametech Awesome xD You listen to the best swiss Band 0 And I really love your gaming setup Q
retrogametech MD is still here, that is going NO WHERE! Unless the hou... no I am not finishing that sentence. The SMS is gone, and the broken DC is a footrest. Its all its good for.
retrogametech Got my CMVS project on the way P
retrogametech Time for an update to this video!
retrogametech Definitely worth picking up! Cost me about 30 2 years ago and plays 1080p mkv files and just about anything else you throw at it! :)
retrogametech Thanks dude! No updated tour with your new consoles?
retrogametech I love your channel especially your ebay junk videos
retrogametech Thanks dude! Yeah Shadow Dancer is great! Found that cart on ebay super cheap! :)
retrogametech We have the same TV cabinet thing :D
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech yes! please! im such a huge fan and it would be so great!!!
retrogametech Awesome xD You listen to the best swiss Band 0 And I really love your gaming setup Q
retrogametech You must be so bored all the time. How do you not wake up and thing: Holy crap, what the hell am I going to play!? Too many choices!
retrogametech MD is still here, that is going NO WHERE! Unless the hou... no I am not finishing that sentence. The SMS is gone, and the broken DC is a footrest. Its all its good for.
retrogametech Besides I might loose power, I only have a SNES now, on the floor, and a CMVS, also on the floor in a box. I show both individually anyway. I dont want to do that again until I fix this mess, that is unless in the next few days a car doesnt fly through the roof destroying anything. But its on my todo list )
retrogametech Got my CMVS project on the way P
retrogametech Time for an update to this video!
retrogametech Definitely worth picking up! Cost me about 30 2 years ago and plays 1080p mkv files and just about anything else you throw at it! :)
retrogametech Thanks dude! No updated tour with your new consoles?
retrogametech I love your channel especially your ebay junk videos
retrogametech Nicely organized setup! I wish mine could be this tidy. Id expect you to be the type of guy to ask, Does this system come in black? Ill take any color... as long as its black.
retrogametech loving the sega collection!
retrogametech Your hardware is so awesome!!
retrogametech Looks awesome man. I love my CDX.
retrogametech PS . id buy that xbox if u ever wanna sell i want that xbox so bad hahahaha
retrogametech All my cameras are too crappy to record video but i could send photos. p.
retrogametech Thanks, I appreciate you watching and taking the time to comment :)
retrogametech look at that wad of black plastic, lovely :)
retrogametech If you ever have a fire Im pretty sure I know where it started.
retrogametech I sold off about 23rds of my PS3 collection. I just never played it and I really dont like that controller. I just buy current gen stuff for the 360. The PS3 is mostly used as a BluRay, DVD and PS1 these days.
retrogametech Do you remember what your entertainment centers called?
retrogametech I am always blown away by your setup. It looks like you put so much time and effort into it. I would be really proud if I ever pulled off anything half as tidy as that ) Keep it up :D
retrogametech you totally need a turbografxpc engine! thatd be the one extra console to get
retrogametech Thanks Ed. I considered wrapping the broomstick in black electrical tape but Im too lazy even for that :P.
retrogametech Awesome setup! Reaally loved how everything got together in there! And the light show at the end was really cool aswhell!
retrogametech hey dude can i ask a quick question ? im in need of a new tv you see because im trying to keep hold of this old crt i have right now but its going old and seems to be dragging a bit now. But i have some retro consoles as well as current gen, does that sony bravia tv you have play retro games well ? i know people say some hd tvs make the retro games a bit blurry, but d they work alright with that tv ? if so could you give me the name and model of it please ? thanks alot buddy !!! :D cheerz !! :)
retrogametech Dude the really sucks. :(
retrogametech Cool collection, I have my Gamecube, Atari Jaguar, Turbografx, Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, 3DO FZ1, Saturn Model 2, Sega Mega Drive  Mega CD Model 1, and my Super Nintendo hooked up to my small TV. While on my big TV, I have a PS3, Xbox 360, and WiiU hooked up. I also have a few in storage, my Xbox (original), PS2, Amiga CD32, PSone, Saturn Model 1, and Mega Drive Model 2.
retrogametech Yeah that gets confusing sometimes! Me  What the hell?, the TV remote stopped working?, WTF? confused look on face. Me a couple of seconds later  Doh! :P
retrogametech Lol, I bet in those days youll be doing videos on doing a ROM hack on your spinal port, have Mega Drive compatible with your brain :D
retrogametech xbox360 and ps3 will never be considered retro. )
retrogametech id love to upload mine, but its all boxed up and in 3 different houses. all i currently have hooked up is my 360 :(
retrogametech R4is are Fake in the sense that it wasnt made by the original R4 team. So ALL the R4is you see are fake. Though the really early R4s you have in your pile might be real, but you would have to really look at them hard and perhaps have a real one on hand to spot them as fake or not.
retrogametech Can you tell me what website you used to buy your R4i Card from I have found a few websites but not sure if they are trustworthy...
retrogametech my brother still using his DSTT card for his DS:Lite, had to update his firmware to 1.17 and stick it on the micro SD card so he could run all the pokemon games on it
retrogametech I remember in 20082009 this was the done thing if you had a DS
retrogametech You could always hide the faulty ones in the dashboard of an abandoned derilict Ford Escort.
retrogametech Hey Martin,i need some help with one of my clone R4 flash carts,i have sent you a pm about it.Thanks
retrogametech would you sell us one?
retrogametech buying one without anything on it is ok but gameseven firmware you cant thats where the law comes into play thats why you have to downlod the firmware for them onto the cards but you need a micro sd memory card as well to do so
retrogametech Common as in you can walk into any electronic store and find a set This way you wont have to order them online.
retrogametech Yeah, its very similar to that. And yes you could quite easily add a 3.5mm audio jack if you wanted. Ill be doing a similar mod to another mk1 Mega Drive in the next few months. Ill can maybe try and film it.
retrogametech No way of knowing but mine have a bug where they wont boot unless I set the DS clock to a few years in the past! No faults with my cyclo DS though
retrogametech wasnt the original DS flashcart the M3 adapter? i had one near launch it was for GBADS and took big CF cards later on the R4 and M3 used the same components if remember and its just a different shell
retrogametech Thanks For The Tip! Ill Try That Later Today.
retrogametech Am i the only one who sees the irony in calling a flash cart, which Nintendo do all they can to stop being produced, official? lol
retrogametech Theyre really useful. Frowned upon by many but most of my game purchases have been based on games I downloaded on one of these things! They were also the main reason I picked up a DS in the first place :)
retrogametech Can i buy these of u?
retrogametech There is more than one type of firmware? No wonder I cant get the stupid thing to work.
retrogametech The point of it is is to be able to use universal cables (RCAComponentSvideo etc...), I know there are component ports and things like that out there but universal cords are more common, From what I can tell you can use pretty much any connector on it if you know what points to solder it was a bit hard for me to tell with the diagram. I could send you some photos of people that have done it, thought I included them in.
retrogametech Ah, I see. But its a lot of work and expense to do something like that. Youd need to buy all the various connectors and components and the price would really add up. Its also quite a fiddly job so youre talking several hours to complete. Im not sure the payoff would be worth it when you consider all the extra cables everywhere and that a single dedicated cable can be found for much less. I can see how it would be a fun Xbox project but personally I wouldnt have any reason to do it on mine.
retrogametech Im considering that! A game related geocache :)
retrogametech And emulating isnt pirating games?
retrogametech but if thats the case they really wouldnt work or work right... the official website to download the firmware is constantly being updated as well and the fact we can download the firmware and it works on the cards kinda means that cant be true ive never heard of such a thing anyway about the bumps even the r4 devs show or did show how to spot fake cards another way is the sticker on back or some writing which is actually the main way i think but again ive never heard about the whole bump thing
retrogametech No, the fake R4s have the bump where the sticker covers the flash chip.
retrogametech Im looking to buy an r4 card. Can you help me? I dont know which website to use becuase everyone I ask says a different thing...I live in USA so I would like one that does free shipping in USA. Bc a few other sites do free ship but they are in china and other foreign places. If you can respond, that would be great :) Thank you.!
retrogametech Cool I wasnt sure how the DMCA affected actually owning and using them things as you are kinda bypassing security features in the DS everytime you use the R4. Im not going to go off on some rant about how bad these things are.... I had one when I had a DS :) great bit of kit for Homebrew especially.
retrogametech a lot of the time, larger micro sd cards are the issue, try putting the firmware on a 2gb card.
retrogametech I believe in emulating games but it is illeagal to rip a game from its hardware and uploading it to the internet.
retrogametech Nintendo have allegedly made r4 unuseable on 3ds.
retrogametech why cant i buy r4s on ebay ?
retrogametech There are cards that run on the 3DS, but as the system updates so often you constantly have to upgrade the software on the card. Its a pain, Ive got one.
retrogametech a brand new R4 clone costs 5.85 with free pp not much profit to be made
retrogametech very nice man, im sure youll get a bit more going for sure. nice pick ups
retrogametech That is ALLOT of R4 cards
retrogametech Do I hear Splash Wave in the background?
retrogametech They arent illegal to have. Youre no longer allowed to sell them but thats about it. And that really only applies to bigger resellers who might want to import a large quantity for openly selling to the general public. Selling or bundling these off secondhand wont be any issue.
retrogametech You dont have to add all of them you could just take some RCA jacks and solder them on from what I know. It would be a hard project. I had an idea of adding a audio 3.5mm jack but not sure if it was possible. Its kinda of like the Sega AV mod you did. I think it was the 16 bit?
retrogametech A couple of times every hour or so. You have to be quick! :)
retrogametech I dont think you can sell them on ebay your lucky, i got 5 of them in there boxes but for the 3ds also so yea ill be selling them at the markets when i go there to sell stuff
retrogametech These are supposed to be illegal to sell on ebay...
retrogametech Emulating is legal if you own the actual game.
retrogametech Just wondering, how long are you searching at ebay every day for deals like this? This is pretty sick!
retrogametech I Got one for 30 bucks in turkey, sold as a Nintendo Super 300 PACK. works dandy.
retrogametech Thanks Luke. Getting anymore working is just a bonus. There are a crazy number of firmware versions and hardware revisions to get your head around! Im pretty happy I got those 6 running and found that bonus 4GB micro SD :) . Now Ive just got to figure out what to do with them all! haha.
retrogametech Can someone link or tell me wich FLASHCARDs there are the best for softmoding DS,DSL,DSI,DSi or XL
retrogametech uhh prety sure officil ones have the bump they even have wifi too i doubt you could download the kernal if it was fake
retrogametech Thats a big no no sorry. That would be me outright selling pirated games!
retrogametech I find it really difficult to keep on top of PMs. I try and respond to new video comments daily though.
retrogametech Go to the official site Ed, there are a few. Some games seem to work with different ones. Very annoying.
retrogametech Im pretty sure the first gen original propper ones had the black background.
retrogametech Sounds good hope to see more mods like that pretty soon. Did you hear about the 360 mod that lets you make a 360 receiver for window pc games?
retrogametech thats not possible i even ordered a couple from different places one is official they all had the same bump only acekard etc dont ive never seen an (well at least more current r4s even the 3ds) they all have bumps only the really old cards dont
retrogametech The R4 cards will all work for the ds. You have to download a patcher and new firmware. easy
retrogametech I remember Chinese stores selling the original R4s for a pound each when they did the update and stopped them from working. But the R4i ones can definitely be reflashed.
retrogametech I bought an original NDS from Gamestation when they first came out and it came with a flash cart that used micro USB. I think that was the first cart ever
retrogametech Sadly most of them have hardware faults.
retrogametech In that case would you mind selling me a blank one as you wouldnt be selling any games, just the ability to use them?
retrogametech Love these little flash carts. All my game collection in one cart is a beautiful thing.
retrogametech Using DSTwo on my DS. Works excellent. No need for patching and has all the real time savescheats.
retrogametech Try using Wood firmware! It should be compatiate with almost all of them.
retrogametech So in the end how many did you get to work again?
retrogametech They are illegal to sellhave fullstop in the UK but that wouldnt stop me :)
retrogametech please tell me cause i really want one of thecause i cntt find any of them on ebay
retrogametech i got the same wifi r4 ,that works for you :)) bought it for 18 before this website got shut down
retrogametech Wanna sell me some? :D
retrogametech Whow 8 for all of them? I have 3, 1 4 ds and 2 for 3ds an i spend like 40 on them
retrogametech Looking for the correct firmware for your clone? I really cant help sorry. There are just so many clones and hardware variations with hundreds of firmwares its impossible for me to say which one youll need. You can maybe try one of the generic Wood firmwares people have mentioned here. But other than that Im afraid its just a case of trial and error until you find the correct one.
retrogametech Ive already got more than Id expected to work again so its all good :)
retrogametech If only there was one for 3ds D:
retrogametech The ones with bumps are not official, theyre the fakeclone R4 cards. The market was totally flooded with them and even legitimate resellers ended up selling them. In this joblot I got many of those fake R4 clones with the bumps and many of the official ones without. In comparison the fake ones have much poorer build quality and dont work with the proper R4 firmware.
retrogametech Sadly most of these appear to be hardware related faults.
retrogametech where can i find a case like that for DS games? P.S I live in Greece and its very hard to find.
retrogametech retrogametech Where did you pick up these r4s from? Cant seem to find em anywhere :(
retrogametech I originally bought an M3. It works crazy well.
retrogametech Wood R4 is the best software for r4. The Acekard2i is great.
retrogametech The TT cards work nice, used to have one years ago for my DS.
retrogametech RetroGameTech I hope youve had a chance to look at the PM I sent you Id love to watch you do this modification if you could do a full on tut of it thatd be awesome. I think you could do it easily.
retrogametech Awesome haul, great video as always.
retrogametech Theyre illegal to sell at all in the UK, and I think in Germany? Although Im not too sure about that.
retrogametech Just looked for it there. Was it about a component mod for the original Xbox1? If so I doubt Id ever do that, sorry. You can find and buy HD component cables for the original Xbox really cheap on ebay. Thats how I have mine hooked up so it outputs in 720p for XBMC and some of the games. Theres no need to install separate connectors like that since the Xbox1 natively outputs component via its own AV port. It would cost a lot more in parts than it would to buy a cable that does the same thing.
retrogametech AAAAAGGGHHH!!! If my ears had legs theyed be running away right now
retrogametech i would love to get that game!
retrogametech Sonic Adventure 7 returns......
retrogametech the musics horrible but this is still pretty neat :)
retrogametech I actually have Sonic 3D Blast 5 on a separate cart. Seriously.
retrogametech thats sonic 1 game gear lv hard
retrogametech Lol I got this but for gameboy advance
retrogametech I have a boxed copy of this game for sale if anyone is interested?
retrogametech Im impressed, looks in my mind very good!
retrogametech why the hell is this in color i know that you playing on the GBA but make a video of plaing it on the original gameboy
retrogametech Forget it now, its really an horrible pirate game.
retrogametech PopStations sure have come a long way graphically. Shame about the sounds.
retrogametech that music is amazing i want to download it extended version on mp3
retrogametech where did you get this?
retrogametech That looks pretty cool for what it is. I cant believe that someone took the time to do that, and even more amazingly how they foreshadow Sonic moving house to Nintendo )
retrogametech What Do You Aspect The Music To Be? From A Gameboy?
retrogametech de ja fucking vu. i picked this up in china but it had its own cart
retrogametech right in the childhood ... man that hurts
retrogametech I dont think that game actually looks too bad. The graphics are better than thte Game Gear games. Though it obviously has some horrid issues.
retrogametech Can you play Game Boy games on the GBA?
retrogametech i have one of these but the games printed on the cartage are poorly printed
retrogametech (Please respond!) Where can I get this actual cartridge?
retrogametech Its funny because the music is Sonic music in slow mode and kinda bad a bit, but I can hear angel island on the 1st level.
retrogametech It actually looks nice. The sound is awful thou. :D
retrogametech you can use supergameboy, so recording will be easier.
retrogametech That music is horrific, it shouldnt even be legal to put that music on that bootleg game lol...
retrogametech Oh christ. The two songs that play are terrible renditions of the Sonic 3D intro music and Angel Island act 1. Took me until after the video to recognize the second one, it was that butchered.
retrogametech His accent tells me hes from Scotland
retrogametech Rememver these from china
retrogametech I would want one. Mostly to say I have it. Only so many do.
retrogametech Ive played this game. I remember discovering a glitch in the game when I can go to the left and somehow Sonic would appear at the right side of the screen and then the game glitches out making Sonic walk on an Invisible path.
retrogametech Its actually not too bad. The controls are a little unresponsive but otherwise its a pretty decent bootleg. A lot better than that Sonic Fighter GBA game I got a few weeks back.
retrogametech OMG, the music is simply unacceptable xD.
retrogametech Its the intro music to Sonic  Knuckles from MegaDrive.... HORRIBLY BUTCHERED!
retrogametech its on the saturn not the mega drive
retrogametech dude run y r u walking your supposed 2 make sonic run
retrogametech These console homebrew hack like games really usually put in music as an after thought. I would like to play one someday with decent music. haha
retrogametech YOU. HAVE. BEEN. WARNED.
retrogametech I have the exact same cartridge. :) watch?vubX0a8Ngct3m40s
retrogametech Now I know who bidded over me. D:
retrogametech Its the MD everywhere except North America. They had to change the name in North America because of trademarklegal issues.
retrogametech Have you never heard any chiptune or what can be produced using a GameBoy and LSDJ? You should YouTube it! )
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech These console homebrew hack like games really usually put in music as an after thought. I would like to play one someday with decent music. haha
retrogametech It looks more like the Saturn version of the game theyre using.
retrogametech YOU. HAVE. BEEN. WARNED.
retrogametech I have the exact same cartridge. :) watch?vubX0a8Ngct3m40s
retrogametech Now I know who bidded over me. D:
retrogametech Its the MD everywhere except North America. They had to change the name in North America because of trademarklegal issues.
retrogametech Where did you get this???
retrogametech this looked alot better than i expectet! i am genuinly impressed! thanks for sharing! )
retrogametech where do you get all your broken consoles from ? not apt for this video but i keep forgetting to ask lol
retrogametech Have you never heard any chiptune or what can be produced using a GameBoy and LSDJ? You should YouTube it! )
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Well, since were being all pedantic... Tip: Game Boy is actually two separate words. Also the actual GBA used in this vid is an AGS001 SP NES edition which has been modified using the guts of a pink backlit AGS101. Do you think I should also quote all of these unnecessary details everytime I use the console in a video? Surely when I say Ill be using a backlit Game Boy Advance thats enough info for anyone. :P
retrogametech You are right... the music is indeed horrible
retrogametech Any link (or at least the chinese name of the cartridge) to buy it on taobao or other ? Great video, loves these chinese hacked games.
retrogametech Only thing missing is the blast processing and you wouldnt be able to tell this from the Genesis version :)
retrogametech The Title Screen music is the Title Screen music from Sonic  Knuckles and Green Hill Zones music is Angel Island Zone Act 1 from Sonic 3. Just horrible, 8bit versions.
retrogametech The music sounds like a cryptic message from deep space.
retrogametech thank god you told me that, it was genuinely doing my head in!
retrogametech Have you ever considered using a capture card and recording from a Game Boy Player or Super Game Boy?
retrogametech The intro music is a really shitty 1 rendition of the title music from Sonic  Knuckles..
retrogametech I Believe In A Thing Called Love by The Darkness? Horrible
retrogametech Sure, just look at Final Fantasy! I made the joke a long time ago, I think they are going to keep it limping on long enough to get into the 70s with it...
retrogametech Cheers for the mental image. Any particular reason for multi coloured chalk? Sadly the cameras mic doesnt do it justice. In real life the frequencies being produced make it almost unbearable to be in the same room. For real!
retrogametech Its damn awful, sounds like a child composed it.
retrogametech Green hill  angel island I think
retrogametech Woah how did you know?! It looks JUST like a real GB cart!
retrogametech Theres nothing wrong with 8 bit music, it brings back memories for me also, but not that. Its hardly musical.
retrogametech oh my god the sonic  knuckles title theme just got murdered lol
retrogametech I know what you mean. The 90s dont seem that long ago. Its weird to think that 2002 was a decade ago!! That was just yesterday, in my mind.
retrogametech Have you ever listened to a dialup modem trying to connect to the internet or a ZX Spectrum loading a game? No? My friend, youre in for a real treat! :P
retrogametech I actually checked that out after you posted this comment and you totally right!! lol The Game Com version is way worse than this! AND its an officially licensed Sega game!! That crazy!
retrogametech Suddenly the ugliest man in Glasgow wasnt good enough for her!
retrogametech Tip: console name is GameBoy Advance SP
retrogametech I think these were mostly sold in places like China and Taiwan. From what people have told me, lots of stores in China openly sell bootlegs and fakes as the norm. Here in the UK theres usually always a stall at every flea marketcarboot where people can buy cheap games.
retrogametech Ebay, carboot sale, flea market etc
retrogametech Sonic 3D Blast 5 lmao..
retrogametech My poor sennheisers D:
retrogametech It actually looks good.
retrogametech uhh thats what he said
retrogametech its called mega drive in japan.
retrogametech 9:01 Flashcard detected
retrogametech Today i got a perfectly fine, 100 working, good condition, GBA SP for 4 (got it off a friend)
retrogametech 2:20 I cant find a faulty NES gameboy advance, so Im combining a faulty flame red and a pearl blue
retrogametech Just want to say Im loving your videos and I also love the Double Dragon Neon soundtrack!
retrogametech Why dont u work with GameCube
retrogametech Is it pokemon music in the background? It sounds like it from ruby sapphire or emerald.
retrogametech yes! please do more fixes!!
retrogametech I Was Playing Pokemon Mystery Dungeon On My DSI And When I Switched It To The 3DS I Noticed It Right Away.
retrogametech Hey man can u help me I have a ds lite that doesnt work, the probelms is that when I turn it on the power light is on (green) but theres no sound or picture.
retrogametech I cant understand how people always seem to get juice INSIDE the cart slot! Ive seen so many systems like this. How are you spilling juice inside your console?! lol Maybe kids sabotaging their older systems to persuade parents to buy the latest model? Who knows shrugs.
retrogametech Ive read about it and seen the result. Never tried it myself.
retrogametech Excellent projects as always!
retrogametech Thanks, dude. Didnt you fix up a Virtual Boy? Or am I imagining things again?
retrogametech The lime green DSl is nice man, I saw one recently and wanted to get it, just for the colour :P
retrogametech My DS Lite recently stopped holding a charge and I read online it could be one of the fuses, but in their example, it had fallen completely off and a quick check told me they havent fallen off on my DSL. How would I diagnose if, and which fuse is the problem?
retrogametech cool finds as always dude! btw i downloaded the deme of deadlight! the game you reccomended me! it looks and plays awesome! love the art style in it too! btw how long is the game? is it worth a purchase? cheers dude! :)
retrogametech Cool GBA SP. Interesting stuff man, hopefully there are no problems while fixing them. Those have to be some of the cleanest NESs I have seen too.
retrogametech Just messing around with and modding old consoles over the years. You pick up and learn as you go. None of what I do is overly complicated or difficult :) . Most of the time things just need a full strip down and clean.
retrogametech Double Dragon Music :)
retrogametech I Need To Get A DS Lite Like That. My Lites Top Screen Is Faulty. The L Button Is Missing And R Doesnt Work. Really Sucks, It Was My First As Well As A Christmas Gift Back In 2007. I Noticed DS Games I Played On My 3DS Looked Like They Took A Graphics Hit.
retrogametech You are what inspired me to buy my first retro console (SNES) and fix it 3
retrogametech Thanks! I try to make as many as I can. :)
retrogametech Music detail in the description :)
retrogametech Thank you Martin let me know when u do also would you mod my snes and mega drive to play all regions and 60hz please
retrogametech Were any of them AGS 101s?
retrogametech They were never officially released in the UK so no not really. You can very occasionally find imported units on ebay. Pretty rare though and quite expensive.
retrogametech I hope this isnt some sort of dodgy euphemism! Either way, have fun! :P
retrogametech 7:00 i hear double dragon!! I play super double dragon on my snes so often its one of my favorite games lol
retrogametech When youve finished the NESs, would you be willing to sell me one or do you want to trade for something? PM me!
retrogametech why dont you just buy a new one and just repair that one it would save you money and repair time
retrogametech Youre lucky it still worked and hadnt corroded inside!
retrogametech Cheers, Rob! From memory Deadlight is supposed to be 5 hours long (I think). Pretty sure I finished it in about 23 sittings. Its not massively long but some parts can be really tricky and require multiple attempts. I loved it and Im going back to 100 it and find all the collectables etc. Perfect game for Halloween! :P
retrogametech What mod card do u have in ur ds?
retrogametech Holy hell you cleaned up that 360 controller really well. When you picked it up I actually thought it was some faulty brand spanking new controller, kudos!
retrogametech Whats your ebay account?
retrogametech You can get them on eBay really cheap for about 34. But I really dont recommend composite for the Dreamcast at all! Youll be missing out on so much of the Dreamcasts awesome, vibrant arcade style visuals. Invest in either a proper RGB Scart or if you really want to see what the Dreamcast can do then get a VGA box! :) . Both are well worth the extra money.
retrogametech Maybe next one I do. Its a pretty tricky thing to film :P
retrogametech i opened it up and heated up a piece of it yea. lol.. but so far no real techy fixes.. :)
retrogametech Martin, I know you deal with these things, so I thought I might as well ask. Do you have any spare Dreamcast composite cables? I bought 2 Dreamcasts from Gumtree and the guy didnt give me any.
retrogametech Hey Martin, Been a subscriber for awhile... thanks for all of the great videos! I, like WhiteSpartan down there, am curious about where you sell the consoles and accessories from your videos. Please let us know! Thanks, Q
retrogametech In the past I ended up selling my videogame items !
retrogametech Aww man, that sucks! Hope it heals quick!
retrogametech When youve finished the NESs, would you be willing to sell me one or do you want to trade for something?
retrogametech Lol, Its weird, definitely not a colour Id usually go for. But when you see them in real life they look awesome! The real colour doesnt really come across on camera.
retrogametech do they have the ags101 SPs in your area?
retrogametech i will download it ! but last nite i broke my hand left hand! so is impoosable to play games! its hell for me not to be able to play games!!! :)
retrogametech What is his ebay account because i would by a refurbished system from him
retrogametech nice lime green ds its not physcolgical its proven that the colors and the quality on the motherboard and the ds itself is better than any other Ds lite hoped this helped bye mate.
retrogametech I also have brand new card slot if you need one how much is snipping from us to uk? I want no money for it.
retrogametech Le Joker Dans Toute Sa Splendeur
retrogametech i was just asking where i could find a gameboy advance sp i have been looking everywhere
retrogametech Nice! I wish Id thought to check the warranty on mine before I tore it apart to diagnose the cartridge fault. Ive been lucky with warranty on secondhand consoles a few times in the past. Xbox 360s used to be good for that.
retrogametech I can drop you a PM when I get around listing it. I dont generally share my ebay details on YouTube for security reasons.
retrogametech I would have liked to have seen you perform the fuse repair on the DS. That would have been interesting.
retrogametech Background Music Bring Back That Catchy Tune You Used To Use!! Always Interesting Man!! Theres Not Enough Hours In The Day. I Wish I Could Fix Stuff Like That.
retrogametech Interesting videos, I remember when I found out how to fix dropped G.B.As, it took 5 seconds to fix and without any soldering, I sold one on and made about 40 profit, I would have fixed a lot more if Nintendo hadnt released the S.P. so soon. Then I bought a faulty S.P  fitted the glass  lighting to my translucent G.B.A, with some extra l.e.ds on the sides  a switch, that was my first D.I.Y project.
retrogametech I find it amazing how people will let their stuff get so dirty. Even more so when they sell it and send it off like that. Not even a quick wipe down, Id be embarrassed to sell something like that. When I traded in my my black DS lite to get a 3DS the guy was amazed at its condition. I got it in December 06 but it was mint condition, simply because I kept it in a case with a cleaning cloth from day one, and applied screen protectors day one. No crack in the hinge, so scuffs or scratches on it.
retrogametech class vid i like how u fix them and sell them
retrogametech How do you find out these faults, do you just take a chance buying these broken units?
retrogametech Yes they do, he lives just one city over and although they are rare, we do have them.
retrogametech Lol, you should have seen the condition it was in when I got it! It was disgusting and I was almost tempted to send it back to the seller (I was pretty angry, haha). Instead I decided to give it a full strip down and refurb. Turned out really nice! :)
retrogametech Its best to just wash your hands and not think about these things! :P
retrogametech I dread to think what that stain is on the back of the 3DS...
retrogametech LOL! No it wasnt, but maybe, after all, there is such a thing as an innuentendo.
retrogametech Yes, the 3DS is more or less the same size as the DSL. It fits in regular DS cases etc
retrogametech No, but I think there are a few videos showing that on YouTube already. As long as you are reasonably confident with a soldering iron then its not too difficult.
retrogametech can i buy that nes of you please
retrogametech Spilled liquid? It always boggles my mind how careless some people are with expensive toys like these. Granted, many of these DSs were owned by children, but I cant believe how irresponsible some are with their video games! Back in my day at the mere age of 8 I protected my Game Boy like my baby!
retrogametech Hi i was just wondering is there any way to repair the hinges of a Nintendo ds light as they are a bit loses and i dont want it too break. Thank you
retrogametech Id be really interested in that NES version GameBoy Advanced SP but where do I go to buy it? EBay?
retrogametech class man how you fix them up then sell them off
retrogametech Is the GBA SP NES version still availible?
retrogametech Ill try and do a vid on that when I get some spare time. Ive not used it much yet so cant really give a good opinion on it.
retrogametech That was a great video. Im off to play my handheld console in the bath... whilst repeatedly changing games cartridges.
retrogametech Keep up the good work mate great video :) I always wanted a nes
retrogametech I have heard of the camera adding ten pounds, but making something look clean is a new one! Maybe its the lighting...
retrogametech Was just wondering as I have a C64, Super Famicom and orig gameboy that could use it... but have you tried makingusing Retr0bright? Ive heard of people having really good luck with it and other completely destroying their shit.
retrogametech Yeah you make a lot and it seems like everyone enjoys them so keep it up!
retrogametech Hello, Im curious as to how you clean and fix all these systems? Could you make some tutorials? Ive fixed, cleaned, and modded many consoles but some some things you talk about intrigue me and Id love to see how you do it as Im sure many others would love to see as well.
retrogametech I could never let my stuff get dirty like that, my GBA SP is a little scratched but that was more the previous owner and my little brother and sister than me.
retrogametech Im sure, the AVGN would love to own one of these multi adapters.
retrogametech when you split the for the wires I assume it was parallel, does the amperage drop or did you use any resistors inline... I want to do this with one of my old dell power cords but the output is 19V I was going to add a resistor to drop the volts down to 9 but I dont what to fry anything with the amps.
retrogametech Hi,Do you have any more information on how this was made? I want to make something similar is there a schematic you followed at all?
retrogametech 10 pounds is 16.68 dollars. Sorry. But you were close enough. So yeah
retrogametech I just did this mod, great idea! Everything seems to work fine as long as you dont get the polarity of the Mega cd wrong as this will blow a fuse in it, its an easy repair if you have any kind of soldering skills though. no more power blocks taking up loads of space and creating tons of heat in my cabinet!!!
retrogametech wow that is awesome! i wish i was smart enough to do this...lol Cheers Martin
retrogametech Wow! thats amazing! (first but i dont really care)
retrogametech The 32x and Model 2 Genesis has a different power jack with the polarity reversed..
retrogametech Man, I love your floors. I am in awe every time you shoot a video.
retrogametech Me too! Is it worth it to mod the og box though
retrogametech nice class idea man great vids :)
retrogametech Yep! :P . My prototype was actually made using a 7.5V PSOne PSU. It powered all 3 systems ok but was struggling and getting a bit hot with the amount of current being drawn. A PSOne PSU would probably be sufficient for powering a Mega Drive and 32X combo on their own though.
retrogametech OK, I just did this with one i got from ebay, the sega cd worked and the genesis worked but I fried 2 of my 32xs doing this. Is it the 32x doesnt support more than 4a? I have another 32x but i am afraid to try it since it might burn it.. my room smells like burned electronics after this. can you help me out? do you think i may have reverse polarity on it.? i think I have reverse polarity before by accident and this has never fried them like this.
retrogametech how much did it cost to make?
retrogametech Bloody brilliant, man ) Definitely adding this to my list of future projects. lol
retrogametech Any chance you could make a tutorial on how to make one of these?
retrogametech Great videos mate, keep em coming. I wouldnt be surprised if Retro Gamer called in the future for an interview.
retrogametech Haha, seems Im a little late to the party judging by some of the comments :P . Theres another really cool mod Ive heard about where you can run all 3 systems with a single Sega PSU plugged into just the Mega Drive. The 32X gets powered though the cart slot and MCD through the expansion bay. It involves reworking some of the internal power circuitry in all three but I cant find any solid details on the mod. That would be the ultimate setup!
retrogametech Every time I get a retro system I completely dismantle it then wash it in the sink with hot soapy water and a toothbrush. Let it fully dry then wipe it using a microfibre cloth sprayed with a small amount of WD40. Makes old systems look like new! I did a howto vid a while back. Should be on my channel somewhere :)
retrogametech I have a gba sp that i stepped on, the system still works but half the screen is black,.. is it an easy fix and cheap or should i just buy another one?
retrogametech Its not, its really easy. You just need to strip a few wires and solder them together :) .
retrogametech If I ever get my Genesis  CD  32X working, Ill give this mod a try.
retrogametech Thanks dude. Did you notice the game I had plugged in? lol Had to dig that out after watching your recent gameplay.
retrogametech Nice job Martin :) 4.0 Amps should be more than enough. I used 3.0 Amps on my all in one Sega fusion console, been working great so far. Great video!
retrogametech Wow, thanks RGT for uploading this! I remember when a buddy of mine borrowed my Genny 32X CD setup, and had hooked the wrong powersupply to my then 400 model1 SEGA CD, and killed it. I died that day. I am soon going to build a Genesis 32X CD minicab, and using only one adaptor will help heaps. I just uploaded a Dreamcast arcade cabinets video you might really like. Its a new upload, so Im sure its pretty low on the Dreamcast searches, so the link is watch?vsBCYo9Kn1B0 Thanks again man.
retrogametech Thanks.. I figured it out. I also burned 3 32x units however I managed to get them fixed by replacing one of the components on it.
retrogametech Wow your power plugs are different than my north American plugs
retrogametech Great mod Martin! What about the MVS? Do you have any news on this project? Im really looking forward to see it working again!
retrogametech Thanks, Thomas. It all seems to be running fine :) . Ideally Id like to get it looking a bit tidier. Maybe use a small hobby box as a junction box to better hide the connections or something. Really appreciate all your input and help btw!
retrogametech Yeah I did lol. Cheeky! I have the real OutRun coming in not long from now, so that adventure will be over. Seriously though, this is McGuyver type ingenuity. Why I love watching your stuff!
retrogametech I never seen this but it looks cool
retrogametech Ill have to do this mod a couple of times:). Where did you scavenge the plug ends from?
retrogametech Now you need two more for Saturn and Dreamcast
retrogametech Thanks for the mention. I 1st designed my version of this power supply more than a year ago when one of my customers asked if I could create one for him. I set to work running current draw tests on all 3 units combined. I then started quality testing and endurance testing. Today the Trio is a best seller at Retro Game Cave.
retrogametech Those are the strangest plugs I have EVER seen. Im used to polarized plugs and occasionally a round grounding pin.
retrogametech Sounds like you need a couple of those Sega strips! lol
retrogametech Do you connect the cables in series or just all together? also if i get a 9v 2a can i just run 2 units off of that instead of getting the 9v 4a to run 4 ?
retrogametech that looks difficult, aha
retrogametech Just visted your site, very cool! I really like the simplified daisy chain design you use. Im not surprised people are eager to buy these things!
retrogametech Dam I Love Your Setup! All I Currently Have Room For Is My Wii, Gamecube And 360. I Have To Keep M y PS2, N64 And Anything Else On A Seperate Table.
retrogametech As a mega drive gameplay vetran myself, OMG, at 2:21 you used one of those 12 volt outlets. IM PROUD OF YOU!!!!!!! Ya know, Id rather rig up a sealed leadacid battery in a cubby on the TV stand, and allow a lowamp power brick to recharge it before using more realtime watt output for the Sega systems, seeing that we only play video games for 8 hours a day at average. I can do some eyeballed math since I am an advocate for use of SLA batteries. I have other reasons in mind to use a batt
retrogametech Do you have a brand and model number for one of those power supplies please?
retrogametech The voltages and current running though the wires is very low. Theyre all soldered together and properly insulated so the chance of fire is extremely low. The cigarette adapter has been completely gutted. Its really just a plastic housing to keep the wires from getting tangled or damaged and isnt part of the circuit. The PSU itself is fused as is the power strip itll be connected to. So any major short circuit or component failure would burn out the fuse before anything else.
retrogametech how did you get your consels so clean?
retrogametech its a nice thing you have fuses in your plugs. in europe we only have circuit breakers, usually one for each room of the house.
retrogametech Haha, thanks dude. Those oversized power adapters have always bugged me and Ive been after a way to get rid of them for a while! Im sure people have done this before although I dont think anyone has ever released a commercial product. Is that the cable that gives you stereo sound over RGB scart with both mk1s? Ive got me one of those too! Awesome!
retrogametech Whats that xbox lcd th ing
retrogametech Very copla mem thanks
retrogametech Hey martin, neat mod looks like it save you a lot of power  gets rid of those nasty 90s brick plugs lol, what is that in the master system card slot?
retrogametech Awesome work as always!
retrogametech SOOOOO MANY WIRES! lol
retrogametech You should produce these things and sell them on ebay or somerhing.
retrogametech The PSU was 10 delivered from ebay and the rest of the bits I had kicking about. If you had to buy parts separately them maybe an extra 7. Not sure what that is in CAD but shouldnt be much.
retrogametech Awesome! Look very tidy.
retrogametech I see that remote on your TV Stand. Is that for the SumiVision Cyclone 2 ? If so, High bloody 5!
retrogametech I uploaded a vid about the MVS projects just before this one :) . Maybe not fully published yet.
retrogametech Interesting, can I ask how long you played and did you compare the picture quality before and after? Ive tried similar experiments and concluded that, with the MegaCD especially, the lack of a dedicated ground completely killed picture quality.
retrogametech Woah, thats kind of creepy, it looks just like what I did... Complete with the psone plug... OO
retrogametech Great idea mate nice one
retrogametech Nicely done! Ive been hounding the internet for a Sega power supply that doesnt have that massive fat plug head, its an absolute pain plugging it into my setup because I have to disconnect two plugs rather than one. I have yet to find one though :(
retrogametech Is that a ps1 power cable in the middle?
retrogametech Thank you so much for this man, I know many, me included will love this. You are awesome indeed :)
retrogametech I was going to say the same.
retrogametech Just noticed that you have a Genesis CDX, would like to know if this console have any problems like loading problems, and the overall lifespam of the console is the same than using a mega drive and a sega cd?
retrogametech nice trick I have 4 power strips for all my stuff and its still need more most of that is because of all the big DC plugs
retrogametech i would love to see a tutorial for this!
retrogametech Most of the official PSUs state 10V as their output. I think the Master System is the only one that states 9V. Testing with a multimeter showed most official Sega PSUs output over that at around 14V. But all the consoles have regulators and circuitry inside them to lowermanage voltage to the levels they require (probably only about 5V7V in most cases). You can happily run a Mega Drive using a 7.5V supply as long as the PSU has a high enough Amp rating.
retrogametech Thats a good idea but i dont trust myself enough to do it. Ill probably burn my house down lol
retrogametech i am from America and i was wondering if you could tell me what Dragons den is please.
retrogametech would you consider making these and selling them?
retrogametech Thanks for the checking out my site. Each connection is of course soldered and then shrink tubed over the center conductor to ensure reliable service even under rough use.
retrogametech Do you know how to fix the sync issue on mega drive when you using RGB ?
retrogametech Very nice although definitely reserved for people that know what they are doing. Would be nothing worse than plugging it in and just seeing a puff of smoke from them all
retrogametech I have a big box of random wires and adapters from lots of faulty electronics Ive scavenged over the years :) . I totally recommend doing it! Its freed up so much space!! You just need to double check the polarity of all your plugs and consoles. I found that most of mine were different.
retrogametech is there a way to remove the yellow from an old SNES without having lab equipment?
retrogametech were do i send my money!!!
retrogametech Just wondering with the 32x originally having a 10v adaptor does the 9v power supply run it without any problems? Reason Im asking is Im debating building one only thing is i have a model 2 sega and it also uses a 10v adaptor.
retrogametech Man that does sound really good but I would worry about causing a fire having all of those branched connections inside that cig lighter adapter.
retrogametech RetroGameTech I sent you a PM with a really cool Xbox mod that you should check out. I think itd be a great video for you to do.
retrogametech A work of genius, you should go on Dragons den with that one!
retrogametech You can buy these on retrogamecave They call it the Sega Trio
retrogametech I would love a tutorial on how to make one of these
retrogametech Man ,you genius! i have in mind the same kind of idea!
retrogametech The reason im asking is because i just bought one for 60 dollars, and it works perfectly, only downside is that it didnt come in the original box. I got it for my collection and considering how difficult it is to find one in working order especially in my country, i kind of scared that it will break if i keep using, because a play a lot.
retrogametech Retro Game Cave sells all in one PSUs for the Sega CD 32x
retrogametech Quick question, how did you wire up your RGB cable directly from the JAMMA harness? I got myself an MVS board and a Framemeister, but Im not entirely sure as to how the wiring should be done.
retrogametech Did you ever finish this project? :)
retrogametech I like your thinking on wiring everything up to a jamma harness. Im doing the same so can switch between my arcade and consolised
retrogametech It means Multi Video System...
retrogametech A good alternative to M.A.M.E.
retrogametech Thanks, I still need to decide on a nice compact PSU to use with it. Any suggestions?
retrogametech I want one in a cabinet!!!
retrogametech GOODD i really dont get how people can go back to graphics like that these days...each to their own obviously a big up for being able to but personally i just think they look poop lol
retrogametech A mini arcade cab with something like a small computer monitor would be cool
retrogametech I love that both of those games share lots of sound effects from Metal Slug :D
retrogametech for some reason this video did not appear on my sub box, thats weird this bug hasnt happened for a long time...
retrogametech Im pretty sure Luke Morse did an in depth tutorial on fixing N64 controllers just recently. If you go to his channel Im sure youll find it no problem :)
retrogametech Personally, I wouldnt go with MDF, purely because of the fact that it conducts heat so quickly. If you were to use it, I would recommend using thin pieces but also making sure you have quite a bit of ventilation via fans. Other than that, its great! Easy to shape, and providing you coat it, rather strong! Hope this helps!
retrogametech Do you have a desoldering iron? You say it took forever to desolder the ICs, I felt that way too until I got a Hakko 808. Expensive but saves an AMAZING amount of time if youre constantly working on stuff like me, and also you have the heat on your components for a lower amount of time, greatly minimizing chances to damage componentsburn traces. Highly recommended.
retrogametech Wow, that is a small MVS :) I really like how small it is, should be great for the console. Nice you finally got the UniBios. Looking foward to the progress. Btw, what materials are you thinking about using for the housingshell?
retrogametech just put it in an old bubblejet printer case. it should fit.
retrogametech RetroGameTech cheers mate,
retrogametech hey dude, hope you get better soon! Also, ive been wondering for a while, where did you get your watch? Its awesome! :D
retrogametech I think the most annoying part about that multicart is that the games are not in alphabetical order.
retrogametech Thanks dude! Its nice to finally get to mess around with some of those games1 XD
retrogametech this is what i like to see, YouTubers helping one another instead of arguing about religion
retrogametech Thanks, Luke. Yeah would love to have a go at building a mini cab! Im still pretty confident I can get that original MVS board running again. It would be really cool to have a little cab for messing around with arcade boards. Loving the Neo Geo games right now! Ive been enjoying Strikes 1945  and Neo Drift Out. I watched your NITD lets play the other day then realised it was actually on my multicart! XD . Win!
retrogametech Could you tell me how to fix an n64 controller from the joystick not having resistance? Thanks
retrogametech awesome stuff! cant wait to see it consolized!
retrogametech yeah ill pm you a link for the one i use. i gotta dig through my purchase history to find the product number and everything. ill send you a link and the product  as soon as i find it. its a pretty small psu so i think youll like it.
retrogametech Cool to see this version MVS board. First thing I noticed was the battery. Is that stock? Good video man:)
retrogametech I really like the compact size of this board, it should make a nice looking console when youre done. I also really like the NeoGeo CD controllers. The picture looked great to me. Hope you feel better soon.
retrogametech HEY MARTIN, LOVE YOUR VIDEOS AS ALWAYS. IS THERE A CORNER MISSING FROM YOU TV?
retrogametech Cant wait too see it running, are you gonna build a case?
retrogametech Multi Video System... wait that was a joke right? .
retrogametech Will be good to have a working unit, so you can maybe get more games etc Hope you feel better soon, plenty of rest  games :)
retrogametech Thanks, Ed! Yeah that the first time Id ever tried one of those controllers. Very cool! Love the clicky direction pad. All controllers should have this!!! Up close the picture looks like its a little over exposed on the white or light coloured graphics. I think it just needs a little adjustment. Adding some pots to the RGB and Sync lines should sort it out.
retrogametech So when youre done consolizing the MVS are you going to keep it? If so, where are you going to put it? Your setup has no room. Well, unless you take out the CDX.
retrogametech i cant wait to see the finished product!
retrogametech This video is probably my first tutorialish video on how to build a CMVS :) I have some MV1C boards that I desperately want to consolize and Im trying to balance that, with tutorials on soldering, desoldering.. and work! Haha! Great video, subscribed :) Btw what setup is the board connected to right now? Is it just a custom supergunjamma setup?
retrogametech Get Better Man. Just Invite Some Women Over, Being Stuck In Bed Wont Be So Bad Then.
retrogametech New Vid. That time again!... Get well Soon man.
retrogametech Its a slippery slope son, and you are already skidding :)
retrogametech Awesome mvs dude, I have consolized mv1b aswell. I dont have an enclosure for it yet but Im excited to see what you come up with to enclose the mvs board. Maybe you could do a step by step on how you made the housing for it?
retrogametech Thanks! Yep, the whole thing is stock. The battery is in good condition and working fine so no reason to replace it just yet.
retrogametech About the paint...I like to spray it but you can use a very thin nap roller and tip it off with a foam brush. Id go with a Latex paint. Dries good and easy to clean up with water. I hope you feel better!
retrogametech hey mate do you sell these consolised? i seen a few on ebay, but cant seem to find them again
retrogametech btw love your vids. wish i could do this
retrogametech I was surprised how quickly the UniBIOS arrived! Im looking forward to messing about with it. Its actually kinda cool to see how they improved the board design and replaced a lot of the big IC chips with much smaller surface mount components. Its a really tidy and compact design! Im not sure on the materials yet. Probably just a combination of different thickness MDF. Its easy to work with, durable and paints well. I want it to look sleek, minimalistic and simple. Any suggestions?
retrogametech WoodMDF is probably the easiest to work with. MDF is also really flat and smooth which is good for painting andor adding some decals :) The only downside to MDF is getting wet (not a problem here) and its a bit heavy..probably nothing to worry either since its a small console.
retrogametech Dazza2292 us retro fans havent gone BACK to these graphics, we never left them!
retrogametech Yeah the power supply I use is pretty small. ill pm you the website and product number so you can check it out.
retrogametech Thank god for the biosmasta. :)
retrogametech cool pick up, i just got one of these myself and am planning on doing the console transformation to it as well. i was wondering what you ended up doing for a housing for it. i was going to convert mine to 5v and just make something out of wood and t molding, but i want to see some more ideas. thanks for making the video.
retrogametech Because hes a thinker )
retrogametech Itll probably be too bulky to sit on the entertainment unit so I plan to design it in a way where it wont look out of place sitting on its own, freestanding on the the floor. Even though the MV1B is tiny in comparison to the other boards its still very big compared to a regular console. The CDXMultiMega is not hooked up. Its just for show since its way too cool to keep in storage P
retrogametech Another interesting mod that a few people have done to the MV1B, is to remove the cartridge slot PCB, and reconnect it so that it is back to back with the mainboard. This makes for a very tiny NeoGeo MVS that can be put in a small housing with a vertical cart slot.
retrogametech Yep, its an excellent piece of kit! Itll save me loads of time and potential frustration, lol
retrogametech Thats what Id like to do with one of the other boards Im working right now. Ive got a spare old monitor sitting in storage that would be perfect for something like that :)
retrogametech Hope you will get better soon, and get a working console!
retrogametech This is going to be really cool. I look forward to seeing the final product. Good luck man!
retrogametech If you are looking for arcade controls, I used a reseller of Ultimarc. Ultimarc have really good quality products at a reasonable price.
retrogametech sound alot like Arnold Schwarzenegger ... cool
retrogametech Now, I wanna play PKMN gen1 for some unknown reason...
retrogametech Why do the rings make the sound of the cursor moving in a menu in the old pokemon!?
retrogametech Can i buy it from you? Please?
retrogametech I actually own a copy of this! I bought it at Ayr market for 2.
retrogametech For sure! Lets make it happen! :P
retrogametech He Did A Video On It A Short Time Back, I Actually Just Remembered It Existed And Added It To My Wish List.
retrogametech i expected it to be a fighting game. like the one on the saturn.
retrogametech Where did you get this? i want one
retrogametech Never seen sonic this slow!
retrogametech Its just blank info, sadly. 00s repeated to 32mb. :S
retrogametech Hey I sent you a PM the other day, did you get it? I needed you advice on something I bought.
retrogametech its because he has the rare backlit model
retrogametech its as good as sonic 06
retrogametech Haha, a game youve never seen before? Surely not? :P It caught my eye on eBay a few weeks back. Had to check it out and see if I could get it dumped.
retrogametech HaHaHa! as bad as this unlicensed game seems to be,it looks to be better than an official sonic jam for the Game.com......LOL excellent video brother! :)
retrogametech Nintendo has secured there code better. The reason it is harder to dump a pirate game is because Nintendos protection for GBA is the same for every game. The pirate games, however, are probably 35 games of the same encryption. Tons of people tried to break Nintendos protection, but no one bothered to figure out how to copy the obscure, unlicensed titles. P.S. The download link doesnt work at this time
retrogametech Dude please answer ) When are you repairing a console again? I love those vids ) Prob gave the xbox one like 100 views )
retrogametech I could deal with the bad level design and the horrible controls, but that music would drive me to throw the Game Boy across the room.
retrogametech The ROM was just blank. Nothing youre missing out on, heh. :P Well, I think that the pirated games use the same encryption as Pokemon Emerald. The bad thing is that the games are SO badly built that they hardly ever work.
retrogametech Another great video mate. Fantastic quality aswell. Its quite remarkable how clear you can capture the image on the GBA. Normally you see a lot of glare. Looking forward to the next vid
retrogametech and i downloaded the ROM and it worked fine
retrogametech Definitely Do So!! I Have A Spare Youtube Channel For Handheld Gaming Related Stuff, All My Videos Are Very Poor In Quality.
retrogametech i see a sonic.exe icon in here
retrogametech the ring collection sounds is the confirm sound in the pokemon games. lol
retrogametech So a bootleg game wont run on a bootleg console? :)
retrogametech haha mario gunna say bitch where is your blast proccesor now byatch! but as fer the music ..its not bad .. better den some other game ....holy crap it in my head.......
retrogametech Its only dumped part of the game, repeated loads of times. Its the usual for a Sintax pirate. More info : PGC Forums. )
retrogametech more like game of the rear2012
retrogametech That is absolutely amazing! Where did you get it?
retrogametech oh nothing...just due to the fact that people would spend 45 for a flashcart...that plays ...homebrew...I wasnt implying anything about you mate, but for everyone else :P
retrogametech looks like super mario advance (
retrogametech To be honest I like the music in the game.
retrogametech Hey, do you have the crash bandicoot bootleg made by the same company?
retrogametech you cant even force me to play that crap!
retrogametech lol one time i had to go to a certain country and my brother saw a sonic game called sonic advance six at their mall
retrogametech I love how bootlegs always add little mechanics. THROWING his spindash is kinda cool.
retrogametech I looks awesome I love pirate games one of my faves is Super Mario 4 for gbc
retrogametech When you get a ring,the pokemon selection sound could heard
retrogametech Wow! Looks like a real winner to me....
retrogametech The sound that plays after Sonic picks up rings in this game is from the Pokemon games.
retrogametech now i know what were aaaalll thinking right here 3:20
retrogametech The quality is that good because he is using the quite rare backlit GBA SP model.Usually the GBA SP screen is front lit which gives it that annoying glare effect.
retrogametech I always look forward to watching the latest RGT vid.
retrogametech There was no Sonic fighting game on the Saturn.If your on about Sonic The Fighters that came out only on the Sega Model 2 arcade board and on Sonic gems collection on the PS2 and GameCube.
retrogametech retrogametch u r lieing
retrogametech Lol, Ive never played a Pokemon game but it really wouldnt surprise me! Theyve borrowed bits from all over the place.
retrogametech I would totally pick that game up
retrogametech I have this game, I remember my brother telling me my grandfather found it from a seller in the Philipines. I still have it to this day.
retrogametech This game makes duke Nukem forever almost look good.... Almost.
retrogametech omfg the music...MAKE IT STOP haha
retrogametech interesting but looks horrible
retrogametech I dont think its encrypted or has copy protection or anything like that, I think its just stored in a different way which the dumping software doesnt know how to read, which would explain why it just dumps an empty file. Ive got a fake Pokemon Emerald that does the same thing.
retrogametech whats a gamebox at 7:45?
retrogametech funny fake game is copy protected. also i kinda like these games because they are not easy to find sometimes.
retrogametech i love how sonic walks like a derp
retrogametech The sound that plays when you collect a ring is from Pokemon :I why ripoff Pokemon?
retrogametech Yes I hate them, but so long as I dont have to play them I still find it interesting. Who knows, this could be better than any of SEGAs attempts lately.
retrogametech That ring colected sound is from pokemon.
retrogametech Havent played Super Mario 4, Ill look that up when I get the chance. The hacks on cartridge I have are Pokemon Naranja, Quartz, Blue Sea, and Arcoirus.
retrogametech when Sonic is in stand by, it looks like hes fucking jerking im off
retrogametech Sorry, Larry. I find it really difficult to manage both my PM inbox and respond to the comments people leave on my vids. I try to respond to everyone but unfortunately I just dont have the time. Comments left on my vids always take priority since theyre public and any useful info that gets exchanged can be viewed, shared and added to by everyone in the community. My PM inbox doesnt get so much attention but I do go through it every few weeks and respond to what I can when I find time.
retrogametech Take a dump :D liking the colour of your DS lite!!
retrogametech When you collect a ring, it uses the same sound effect as GBA Pokemon games OO
retrogametech It would be nice if a good dump is done for this, Im sure its not that they protected the game but most likely theres a weird data at the beginning of the game that the tool cannot read properly, had the game got more interest Im sure the programmers wouldve found a way to dump this, too bad!
retrogametech So did Sonic! xD Looked like he was jamming to the beat with his idle animation in this one.
retrogametech Cool Beans, I love Rom Hacks and Fan made games, even though they are rarely good, I have a Mario Bros. that has Final Fantasy sprites which is pretty good.
retrogametech Funny that the bootlegs have better copy protection
retrogametech Man that music DOES start to grind your nerves fast! At first I thought it wasnt THAT bad but boy was I wrong...
retrogametech its the same engine for the Crash Bandicoot Bootleg
retrogametech KITT171 get outtatown!!! this was garbage! play sonic generations....its excellent :)
retrogametech Sweet!! Thanks for the share! Well made video cant say that about the game!!! Hahaaaaha, happy gaming! Peace
retrogametech Another great show, you always find interesting little things
retrogametech I thought you might get a laugh out of this, lol. Dont you hate rom hacks?
retrogametech Thanks, dude! Like others have mentioned its a backlit GBA Im using. It makes it a little easier but Ive found even with those, filming the screen without glare can be tricky. So Ive now rigged up a special system for filming shiny LCD screens :) . Its very basic but seems to do the job. Might do a short vid on it in future :)
retrogametech Download permission denied by uploader. (0b67c2f5)
retrogametech Oh hey, its Rayman IV  Crash IV all over again. XD Wow, didnt know the fake Sonic boxart Id seen actually corresponded to a massproduced bootleg. Thanks for showing this off, its rather entertaining to see just how many bootleg reskins there are of this.
retrogametech get your kilt on your lad
retrogametech :D Yeah, I love it, Ive never really been into the whole piratehack scene, but recently I realise that I should be as some good, and very obviously notably bad games have come from them, sounds like theres quite a few terrible sonic ones out there!
retrogametech My cord is broken similar to yours. How did you soder the wires. I tryed and the wires rem to just melt.
retrogametech What on EARTH are you talking about youll start seeing more and more of these being sold as faulty. If youre handy with a soldering iron then you can potentially grab yourself a real bargain! I bought one off Ebay and the damn things peripherals werent sending any output. Headset 1  2  USB decoder work, Possibly the HiFi port are all in working order. However, the main reason I loved this unit was for the 5.1 Analog Output peripherals... but those do not work. Is it a fuse? a diodeResistor, a Capacitor?? could this all be at the Main Intergrated circuts fault? Fourtunatly i have 2 of these exsactly showing the same problem Just i do not know what direction to begin repairing this unit in. .PS: Also, i do not feel like starting the project if the problem persists in a simple manor whereas i always end up doing things the hard way when it comes to the simple repairs.Confident I may be in repairing The Tritton AX PRO 2011 Model honestly either rout this undergoes, BUT the question lies with what do i repair? Because i too would like to have a good bargain out of both my AX PROs.hEX mCcAUSLIN
retrogametech This is not even the same model as mine however if i see a voltage regulator ill give jumping the power like you have done in a last ditch effort to repair mine.
retrogametech Are you getting my messages dude?
retrogametech thats the 6v micro controller, i think the best bet is to leave it as it is, those little feckers are a pain in the balls to take off and replace, all this does is acts as a relay switch which has a on and off controller, just like 12 relays in a car, it senses the voltage and turns on or off according to power, bridging it would probably just shorten the life of the unit by a non substantial amount due to being on all the time, ive had all the tritons but the new pro plus are really good :)
retrogametech Thats the only downside to these things, the wire is a kinda annoying. But theyre massive and really comfy. The earpieces are so big they fit around my ears and rest on my head.
retrogametech Up for selling the other set?
retrogametech do you know a fix for only audio from left side?
retrogametech I got a pair of tritton kunia headphones for 40 asda
retrogametech WOW!! Those are expensive!!! Nice fix!!!!
retrogametech I Pleasure Myself To Comments Like Yours.
retrogametech PS. As For Size, I Have Big Ears So My Headphones Are About The Same Size As My Ears And Fir Nicely.
retrogametech I think you are the real McGuyver! I dont have or know what those are, but this should help someone who does out.
retrogametech I know this sounds cheesy but I figured Id chime in anyway. You might be able to do some sort of contest, I dont know what it would be exactly but considering you didnt spend a boat load of money on the headset it might be an interesting way of getting more subscribers(if you care about that sort of thing). Again I would understand if you didnt want to stoop to that level of promotion just figured Id share my thoughts. Keep on being awesome as usual :D
retrogametech Hey.. I have a pair and hte only problem is the sound quality has dropped and the bass is crackly and im not sure what is wrong. i think its because my friend had them up way to loud and did something to the speakers HELP :(
retrogametech Nice fix. Those actually arent proprietary cables. Based on the logo and shape, those are displayport connectors, usually used on monitors. Kind of strange to see them on a nondisplay item, but I guess they probably wanted a standardsbased connector that supported the amount of pinouts they need for 5.1 sound. Interesting.
retrogametech enjoyed the ramble, tech stuff isnt boring if youre into this stuff. cheers
retrogametech hey man!....great videos...i wonder...can u help me with.. Xstatic sharkoon 5.1 headphones i brought them for 2 euros on flee market.... missing extra parts....i only got headphones with cut cable... no volume control on cable,no digital device...no propriety jack. i peel off cable isolation and i got 1011 wires didnt mapped jet 4x two colored twisted wires 3x one colored wires red green blue mapped 2x plastic wires green and blue for neon light 1x dabble wire i bet its for mix
retrogametech As I was watching the video I looked over at my Xbox and it had the red dot of death
retrogametech Why the fuck would you type like that?
retrogametech Mate could you please add me to your contacts if you dont mind, got a question in regards to this fix.
retrogametech God, that typing is so annoying!
retrogametech Your best bet is ebay, or if youre in the US you can also find things on Freecycle and Craigslist. Garage and yard sales are also common places to find these things cheap. When on ebay, you can search for broken or for partsrepair in the descriptions to narrow the field. Its a little time consuming, but you can find great deals.
retrogametech you could do me a massive favour by showing me how to fix a wired xbox 360 controller, my cable is faulty, thanks!
retrogametech lol great price. I bet the Tritton company makes a lot of money repairing systems from the design flaw...
retrogametech anybody know how to fix if your optical case thing comes off ? please reply if so
retrogametech if u would be interested in selling a set let me know... ill buy a set of fixnon fixed... i dont know y i dont buy faulty stuff online
retrogametech How Madonna is that mic.
retrogametech Driver San Francisco haha :)
retrogametech 5.1 headphones? You got ripped off, mate.
retrogametech where would i look for faulty things? i know a bit about soldering, ive soldered LEDs to my xbox, but i can never find faulty consoles, id LOVE to get a faulty gameboy, and fix it. where do i look, and what do i look for thats an easy fix, like soldering 1 or 2 things back to the board?
retrogametech He does have a point though. Why would you write like that? It takes longer and just looks odd.
retrogametech gross, used headphone?
retrogametech Thanks for all you do love all your videos. You are real easy to listen to and I have learned a lot from what you do because of you I was able to fix my GBA SP that I bought at a swap meet that was sold to me broke :( so I really appreciate all you do.
retrogametech Then dont read it moron.
retrogametech and how exactly did you connect these teo
retrogametech my fucking trittons broke. sounds doesnt travel through the cord so i cant hear shit
retrogametech Couldnt find any on eBay. Nice fix
retrogametech Can u help me with my kinect sensor it does not go up
retrogametech How can i find you on ebay?
retrogametech I Was Kinda Annoyed About The Wireless On Mine At First Because My Old Headphones Had Volume Adjusters. But When I Have A 360 Controller Play And Charge Kit, Possibly 360 Headphones, Samsung Galaxy Tab Charger All Around Me, I Dont Miss Having An Extra Cord.
retrogametech Dont replace the chip, just stick a small signal relay to turn off the 6V when it powers down, normally open etc.
retrogametech Which component did you connect the voltage regulator to?
retrogametech my ax pros dont light up anymore:( theyre just dead! fkin bullshit
retrogametech My Ears Do Not Hurt That Easy. But Reading A Comment With Every Word Beginning With A Capital Does Hurt My Eyes.
retrogametech where did you buy the tritton??
retrogametech I cant believe you gave up on the other board) If it was me, I would sell both faulty boards and find one that works, but that is because I am getting lazy in my old age.
retrogametech if characters are being substituted, then you have a stuck address or data line somewhere.
retrogametech I think that is showing you work ram error? really strange. If you want to, take the bios out of your other board and put it in that one. the other bios should be in english so give that a shot first :) probably have another trace that is broken on that board somewhere as well. look really really close and you might be able to find it. its close to working but the main blue screen should be a cross hatch without any letters. first though, swap out that bios :)
retrogametech The seller said the game was fine and I have no real reason to doubt him. Ideally Id have another system to test it on but I suppose I just have to take his word. It does look in very good condition and it partially loaded that one time so I dont think its the issue. The garbled BIOS text on screen is my main concern for now.
retrogametech Thanks! :) That explains a lot. So it looks like theres maybe an issue with the RAM or video output?
retrogametech Did you get these boards going mate??
retrogametech Im not an expert but I agree with lukemorse1 try swaping out that bios chip but the the green screen that u get might be somethung to do with a dodgy video chip or processor like I said Im not an expert just something I thought of :) hope u get the board working soon
retrogametech That look like a RAM Issue to me. Now Im a bit extreme but Id try to verify that the RAM is working through a Test firstly. Do you have a LogicAnalyser or Scope? If so then try to grab Data from the ICs as they pass on the DataBus. This will require you to get at the Pins though, maybe desolder the 68000, replace it with a Connecter then grab it from there as it passes to and from the 68000. For the Custom ICs this will be harder. Good work thus far :)
retrogametech Odd. That looks like the same mess I had on a bad SNES board. The games played but there was too much color mixingcolors missing going on.
retrogametech NEW CONSOLIZED PROJECT CHECK YOUR MESSAGERS search Sega STV Titan Arcade Jamma Mother Board on ebay
retrogametech i like you watch where did you get it from?
retrogametech Good idea just to get another board, hopefully with the best bits of each board you can get it working. Is the game definitely OK?
retrogametech Im in the same boat, got video issues with a PC Motherboard, but as you said signs of life and thats enough for me to keep troubleshooting...
retrogametech Lol, Oi! Im not giving up on the other board :P. Its actually in much better condition than this new one, so if I can, Ill use the donor to try and diagnose the fault on the original board. Trying to get these systems working again has at times been frustrating as hell! So many occasions Ive been tempted to rage quit and throw them out the window! haha I just want to play me some Metal Slug!!!!
retrogametech Wosk Sam Vesu is czech but I cant get google translate to work on it so.......
retrogametech heres the menu: HARDWARE MENU SETTING UP THE HARD DIP SETTING UP THE SOFT DIP BOOK KEEPING SETTING UP THE CODE NUMBER SETTING UP THE CALENDER EXIT
retrogametech I have just been messing around with MAME to find out the test menus. So, to do a Backup Clear you would turn dipswith 1 to ON, the press A, then press Start 5 times. Then hold A, B  C. Might be worth a shot.
retrogametech Most of the time, the devices are low voltage dc. If youre doing testing, make sure the board is sitting on something bare with no metal near it such as a cardboard pad or something like a rubber or silicon mat. Avoid touching the boards themselves while they are on while testing. Very simple common sense things will help you avoid getting shocked, but again, hes dealing with low voltage items usually.
retrogametech You mentioned before that the cartridge you are using is one of the MultiInOne carts. Perhaps if you tried a legitimate cartridge for testing, you may get a better result?
retrogametech It looks like a badshorted pin in the bios chip probably one of the data lines. since you see the lines on the screen, try tracing the bios lines (especially data) and check em.
retrogametech This is about as accurate as i can get for describingstating what each incorrect letter means: s  r !  space u  t o  n q  p faint o  t faint h  h bfaint d  d g  f e  d c  b m  l y  x
retrogametech how do you avoid getting electricuted ? i know you have to unplug stuff but i heard that devices hide some electricity
retrogametech Excellent progress. Im sure after bit more resoldering pins etc youll get it fired up. Could be just cold solder joints.
retrogametech Thats really good, you might get this MVS working sooner then you thought!
retrogametech Work ram test, I mean
retrogametech Possibly a GPU issue followed by a bad cartridge  cartridge connection pin
retrogametech SETTING UP THE HARD DIP SETTING UP THE SOFT DIP
retrogametech A lot of the solder points around the chips are pretty dull so possibly a bad connection?
retrogametech The text is in English, but there are characters being substituted. The RAM test screen says WORK RAM TEST, but the R, T, and space characters are being substituted with S, U, and ! respectively. The same substitutions are showing up in the menu, among some others (Y for X in EXIT).
retrogametech Will check it out. Thanks for the tip!
retrogametech You maybe right. Maybe it is caused by one of the lines that was soldered, one of them might be unnescessary and might have been left unused for a reason, so you have to break each one of the lines you made and test the system each time.
retrogametech ITS ALIVE! Lightning flashes, thunder booms, electrical gzzzzzk noises
retrogametech what exactly is an MVS?
retrogametech Thanks! And yeah it pretty frustrating working on these boards :P
retrogametech Im really hoping that all it is! :) This board is a bit rough though. Looked like it had been sitting unused for a few years.
retrogametech Best of luck to you man, the neo geos are a bitch to get working, especially the AVS. And hey if you cant get it to work, your could probably send it to LukeMorse from japan. he is pretty good at fixing neo geos
retrogametech I tried swapping out the BIOS chips but got the same garbled menu. Could it possibly be a GPU or RAM issue? I suppose I just need to go over the whole board again and clean up the individual legs on all the chips and resolder. At least theres some signs of life with this one! Nearly hit the roof when I heard the Neo Geo intro music and got the title screen that one time, lol.
retrogametech As long as he doesnt touch the ends of capacitors, hell be fine. Personally, Ive never even had a tiny electric shock, and Im always tinkering with old systems
retrogametech hope you get that thing running, awesome that youre showing us your constant progress and excitement about what it is youre doing. its basically fuel to help me fix or create something. thanks!
retrogametech Oh and the date is 3775 SUN. So your battery is completely flat . That date being that far off might lock the cart up also.
retrogametech I thought you were getting nothing until I recognised COOK!KEEQIOG which is obviously meant to be BOOK KEEPING, and it unravelled from there: it is indeed saying work ram error. The diagnostic BIOS will tell you straight away whether the ramCPU is busted, but it may be that the character ROM (stored in the GPU) is missing or corrupted. As far as I remember, this can be recopied by running an official game cart from your region just once, which leaves a lot of users sol
retrogametech Its SNKs NeoGeo arcade system. The home system is AES.
retrogametech The toughest soldering job Ive done on a game console was to replace the cartridge slot on a Mk1 Sega Genesis. Ive never tried SMD but I do have a good soldering station so Ill probably do it sometime.
retrogametech Instead of solding the new battery I just hold it with some electrical tape, which makes easier to replace, but this mod i so much better! Really nice :D
retrogametech I installed a CR2032 on my Pokemon silver cartridge. I considered a battery holder, but again, I wasnt really satisfied that I had to keep using such a small battery. I just guessed that a larger battery would keep my save file for longer. I mean, same voltage, twice the size, thus much bigger capacity. If the original battery kept my save file for about 11 years, the the new one should hit the 1520 years mark quite easily.What I did was to cut the old battery from its metal pins, and simple placed the new, larger battery on those pins. I didnt use solder, as the cartridge case alone (when closed) aplied enough pressure on it to keep it in place. I did use one small strip of electric tape to keep the larger battery contacts away from the cartridge PCB, though. As I said before, its a tight fit, the cartridge kinda get a little bulkier where the new battery is, about 1mm, but that doesnt do any damage to the cartridge case or the gameboy. It still slides easily into any Gameboy related product without ploblems, and its been working fine until now. (and Ive done this mod about 2 years ago) )
retrogametech I never knew that. Good stuff man.
retrogametech dude how have you not got partership yet
retrogametech Nice video!! Good info
retrogametech Very nice tip! Thanks for sharing Im going to try this out for sure.
retrogametech How long would these batteries last?
retrogametech nice video :) how long do the batteries usually last for Game Boy Color progress saves?
retrogametech I owned the SNES close to when it came out when I was 7, it got lost (how isnt relevant) but I didnt have a problem emulating instead. I did buy another SNES off ebay more recently and will usually prefer that if I have the game, but I dont feel I really lose anything by emulating the games I dont have. One advantage of emulation is the fact that your game saves dont have a limited lifespan since you can copy them and save them and back them up like any other disk file.
retrogametech everyone seems to say 2032 are the batteries to use for this. why 1220?
retrogametech Pokmon uses batteries.
retrogametech watch?vluZWkteXhVEfeatureplcp HEres a video of a NES cart I installed a battery holder on.
retrogametech can you do this same mod with the snes cardtridges
retrogametech The thing with the game saves is true, I used to do that with emulators running on my modded PSP sometimes. The only thing I use now is MAME (running in a mario bros replica nintendo cab I have built, it has special settings for low res on arcade monitor now). I have a few arcade cabinets but I cant buy them all so emulation sure is cool if it can be done on original screen and resolution :D
retrogametech Just stick a rechargeable lithium with a series resistor going to the  on the card to keep it topped up in use. Easier than reopening it constantly!
retrogametech thanks man! really big help! keep up the awsome vids! Could u do a video showing how to replace the housing on a original ds? i have one from china that i got when i was a kid and my cousin broke both screens and tore up the case.
retrogametech I doubt youd be able to fit something like this inside a GBA cart. Although, only a few GBA games actually use batteries for saving. From what Ive seen its mostly only bootlegs that use batteries. There were also a handful of early genuine titles that use them but its pretty uncommon.
retrogametech No worries, I wish hed reply to me though :(
retrogametech Martin, have you read about the new coated lithium ion batteries being developed? Amazing stuff.
retrogametech Haha, thanks dude. Its the one thing that really bugs me about YouTube. It doesnt matter how much research you do, how careful you are to cover your bases or how many times youve rerecorded a video to make sure you mention something youd previously forgotten, theres always someone who seemingly just cant wait to nitpick and criticise. Either that or just post misinformation to try and discredit what youve done. You cant please everyone :P
retrogametech The that I find cool about this, is the battery holder. Of course this is cheaper but that is not the most impressive part to me. It is more that I cannot stand soldered batteries, what with the reluctance to pull it out if worried about leakage of an old cell. Anybody else feel that way? It isnt just a practicality thing (although it is partly that). It is also a factor that may deter people from replacing the battery (if unsure about novice soldering), thereby increasing the chance of a leak.
retrogametech could you post a link to your ebay page? id love to buy stuff from you
retrogametech That Or They Ask Dumbass Questions.
retrogametech i have a pokemon gold that needs battery changing... TO EBAY I GO!
retrogametech Just wondering how long the life on the button batteries is? Thanks for the budgetspeed mod Man! Keep up the great work :)
retrogametech Damn, that is a great question.
retrogametech Any idea how to do this for GBA carts? They dont have the little handle area at the top where a taller battery holder could fit.
retrogametech Oh my gosh I LOVE THESE MODS! You just save like almost half my collection of game boy color!
retrogametech Do you need a lot of money to invest in your hobby? I really enjoy electronics and I enjoy retro gaming and gaming in general even more so. Currently I have a Wii, a PS1, a Xbox 360 Slim, a Gamecube, a DS Lite and a crazy amount of games for consoles I dont have. (PSP, Snes, Nes, Master System, Saturn, all those old consoles.)
retrogametech make a video of the soldering. i wanna see your equipment. soldering, that is.
retrogametech I dont own any SNES games to test it on but I dont see why not. It would probably be even easier considering theres lots more room to work with :) .
retrogametech RetroGameTech I did it the cheapest way possible.
retrogametech Great tip. Thank you for sharing.
retrogametech Ive seen people mod these with AA batteries, but mostly for console carts to hide it better
retrogametech Sapphire ruby and emerald still save just fine. Its just the in game events that require it to be a certain time wont happen. Gbas use some sort of rewritable ROM because it would be smarter, for technologys sake, to stop relying on batteries to save games like that. The only pkmn games you should be worrying about are the GBGBC ones but like liquidhalo said, get one of those backup thingymabobs and use this mod. Ill get around to doing this once I get my game bit screwdriver in the mail.
retrogametech yep battery in ruby mine is dead :(
retrogametech Could this same concept work with NESSNES games as well?
retrogametech No, the carts appear to retain a charge for several seconds (possibly 1020). I switched the battery in my copy of Xtreme Sports while testing out this mod and was surprised to see my save was still selectable the next time I booted the game. So you should have enough time to quickly take out an old battery and fit a new one without losing data.
retrogametech Did they use flash memory to store saves instead? What did the Pokemon games use?
retrogametech do game saves get deleted the second you remove the battery?
retrogametech sorry you will nto save money in the long run. you will spend more money since have to replace batteries so much. i have snes games that still have good batteries in it too and they used 2032 too i think.
retrogametech Hey RetroGameTech! Love your videos. I hate to annoy you, but I was inspired by this video to do this mod to my Gameboy Pokmon Gold cart, I also did an indepth tutorial on how to do this mod. I would be honored for you to check it out: watch?vCKU6hDHgnNQ
retrogametech will the CR1220 Battery and Cell work For Pokemon Yellow since It uses A CR1616 Battery? ps. I bought 5x Cr2025 holders off ebay, so when a battery goes flat I dont need to solder. Also I looks good. To bad GameFreak and nintendo didnt think of it.
retrogametech Although I would resort to emulation instead of this, I still found this very interesting.
retrogametech A great tip Martin, one of the reasons I subbed : )
retrogametech Can you show the battery going in and out of the holder?
retrogametech Haha Larry. Glad to see youre giving support to awesome people doing awesome stuff like this.
retrogametech I wish I was at all handy.
retrogametech This guy is thinking, far too many people just think oh ill fix it with a new battery and some tape. This is a permanent fix and for anyone who has a mega memory card that uses flash to backup saves this makes the process much easier, just backup and replace every 10 years or so.
retrogametech thank you for this tip i was wondering about if i could use a holder instead of having to resoldier ever time
retrogametech Might not, because the top plastic is different  it goes down, while the GBC plastic goes up.
retrogametech I never would have thought of this, good work, man! Now I just need to find smaller ones to fit inside standard gameboy games and Im golden!
retrogametech now I have a cartridge that is flat it doesnt have the space that your has, now will it fit a cartridge like links awakening
retrogametech Id recommend purchasing a Mega Memory Card (Game Boy Color). You can back up a lot of your save files with it! Ive backed up most of my GBGBC saves already! It works great!
retrogametech would this work for normal Gameboy games like pokemon ?
retrogametech I really dont get how people can enjoy emulation. They must have never owned the systems when they came out (gbc isnt that old but im talking all systems). Its all about nostalgia and playing the games on the actual hardware to me. Its like playing on a modern TV , play the games on a good CRT, people throw perfect ones away you can get them for free. Just my opinion, you can play on an emulator if you are into that weird stuff :D
retrogametech Just Curious, Do You Know If Its At All Possible With GBA And Gameboy Games Without Modding The Plastic?
retrogametech Very nice :D All button celld batteries have the same 3V voltages, The number indicates the size of the battery. Usually the life of the battery really depends on the environment theyre stored in. :P
retrogametech i wish those battery holders fit inside my pokemon red :(
retrogametech When the battery dies you lose you lose your save data. Well when you switch the battery, will you lose it again?
retrogametech I actually ordered a lot of a 100 cr2032 battery holders and replaced all my batteries in my NES games and put in the battery holders. Im eventually going to replace all my SNES, SMS and Genesis batteries and install battery holders.
retrogametech If only Nintendo used FRAM to hold the game saves.
retrogametech I have to correct you in that. Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire have batteries but theyre used ONLY for the internal clock feature. The cartridges use EEPROM to save and not SRAM. If the battery dies out on them, they can still save fine, its just that the few time clock events in the game wont occur properly.
retrogametech Would you be able to do a tutorial for this if you havent already?
retrogametech o forgot to ask would this work on original gameboy games. If not is there a smaller version of the holder.
retrogametech haha pretty neat! its sad that the batteries in most games will be dyingdead
retrogametech Very smart way of doing the battery replacement.
retrogametech I think many of the Pokemon Games have batteries, for the real time clock afaik.
retrogametech Careful, not all batteries are 3V. Some are 1.5V.
retrogametech Pokemon Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire all have the internal batteries. Leafgreen and Firered dont have a battery, therefore firered and leafgreen will always save.
retrogametech Can you Please make a Video of you putting it in and everything you did. I want to do this from my pokemon yellow game.
retrogametech Im planning to do this with a load of my gba games!
retrogametech Have you tried this with NES carts?
retrogametech Excllent tip! When you metioned the battery that you used, I thought to myself I wonder how many people will criticise this because of the shorter battery life?. People are so predictable.
retrogametech They do! Check out this video with a tutorial on how to put them inside Pokmon Gold (same shape as Red): watch?vCKU6hDHgnNQ
retrogametech The lower capacity of the CR1220 wont be an issue with this setup. You could even be super extravagant and replace the battery once a year for 10 years and it would still be about half the cost of buying a single CR2025 with solder tabs. And once the CR1220 battery holder is in place youll never have to solder anything ever again XD.
retrogametech Time to go Fleebay shopping...
retrogametech For your xbox with the blue LED how did you get a clear xbox logo cap (the middle thing on the top with a blue light)? Please reply
retrogametech this xbox looks sick, i wish the xbox one looked half has cool as the OG
retrogametech Guys I dont think hed ever sell this. Since its so rare
retrogametech Is that metallica ride the lightning I hear in the background , awesome man .
retrogametech its nice but your black one looks alot better and the switches are much nicer on your black one :)
retrogametech you wanna sold some these MODD XBOX ? heeheh
retrogametech why cant I watch this damn video?
retrogametech Metallica!! Ride the Lightening!
retrogametech When the tray doesnt come open you have to tap the top of it. Not to hard but just enough. Thats what mine does.
retrogametech You think the LCD is expensive?That is a 20x4 HD44780 screen you can pick up a basic one for 2, or the BlueWhite for 46.
retrogametech YOU WERE PLAYING METALLICA IN THE BACKGROUND!!! FUCK YEAH
retrogametech Here in Canada the law is that if the system and games are out of production you can mod it if they are in production you can not
retrogametech Is it me or does this guy sound like Kevin McKidd
retrogametech People need to understand that getting the mod kits arent hard to do at all. If I can do it anyone can trust me
retrogametech 200sex. Tee hee I know its the accent but its kinda funny. (no offence!)
retrogametech metallica in the background! :D
retrogametech Dont u wanna sale one
retrogametech i bet the seller on ebay is watching this yelling HOLY SHIT ALL I HAD TO DO WAS PRESS THAT FUCKING BUTTON!
retrogametech Are you selling this unit?  Ill happily pay for this!
retrogametech Omg black Dreamcast. So cool.
retrogametech Just a question:Have you ever bought a faulty item that you werent able to get working again?
retrogametech I would leave i8t looking standard , a classic in e making, what a gem
retrogametech D3FS3 Its actually to protect the chip from accidental flash
retrogametech Excellent haul, man, but you know, I like what you did with yours better. Buttons are great and all, but dip switches have a great charm all by themselves.
retrogametech Have you removed the clock capacitor on your Xbox?
retrogametech Sick find. Im looking for an X3ce chip myself. hard little bastards to find these days.
retrogametech Hey guys, I am desperate to find a clear x3 lcd front panel, if anyone knows of were I can get one from, please, please let me know. I have a clear modded xbox with x3 chip in  have been trying to find a front panel for a very long time. TiA...
retrogametech DaveSimonH Have you PS3 re pasted with new Thermal paste and your good for another 23 yrs depend on useage.. Happy gaming
retrogametech Cool Mod. I recently got a modded XBOX with installed XECUTER 2.6 Modchip and secondary Hard Drive on Amazon for 40. Fun Fact: It came with a fresh installed build of XBMC 1.1 from April 2005 or so. The seller didnt even know the console was modded, so I think it was a good deal. I love to use my XBOX as a media center. :3
retrogametech You have to give it back now.
retrogametech Would you make me one of these if i sent you my xbox
retrogametech I have one of these, its the business, but how do you change the text on the LCD, mine says toms box.
retrogametech It can mean the same thing. If the hard drive isnt working correctly or it failed while unlocked then the Xbox will throw out error code 5.
retrogametech Haha, I was weirdly disappointed I didnt need to tinker with it! Still, really happy with it :)
retrogametech Do they make a green version of those screens?
retrogametech Robbery with a willing victim! I love it sir!
retrogametech or actually just has to be connected to internet maybe idk?
retrogametech excellent.. still got my modified xbox with executer 2.6 (nonsolder chip) with 80gb hard drive networked upto 2 pcs :) , still love the original xbox.. had a few modified ones over the years.
retrogametech excellent.. still got my modified xbox with executer 2.6 (nonsolder chip) with 80gb hard drive networked upto 2 pcs :) , still love the original xbox.. had a few modified ones over the years.
retrogametech Since its a crystal edition I think it could do with some lighting mods! lol :P
retrogametech for whom the bell tolls !!!!!!!
retrogametech I remember getting that same clear System for my brother awhile back. It wasnts modded though. A really cool system! Im glad you were able to get the system as nonworking a great deal!
retrogametech heh, my Xbox has a stuck DVDROM drive.....hit the open button and then smack the top of the system and the drive opens LOL
retrogametech Yes, If you dont have any other means of watching your content on a TV, The original xbox is still the absolute best console to use as a media center.
retrogametech I got the same thing frim ebay gir free
retrogametech I just wish it would die altogether, I would have just bought a slim but it clinging to life makes me want to keep going with it. It can be pretty ridiculous though the amount of YLOD I have to go through to get it running, the record is 12 attempts, yes twelve..... lol It gave me a reason to pick up a standalone bluray player though, got a Toshiba BDX3200 which when you install the Aussie firmware (USB or CD) makes it region free for DVDs  blurays. Can now get region A locked US blurays :)
retrogametech where can i buy an xecuter 2.6 or 3? or an xbox like this!
retrogametech The original xbox was (sorry still is!) amazing. The only bad feature is how bulky and ugly it is. Fantastic find my friend! Really nice. Your home modded version looks a great deal nicer though. Loving all your videos, keep em coming!
retrogametech Not sure  the emulator would need to be written to accept it.
retrogametech Totally worth picking up! :) Get it soft modded and use it for emulation!
retrogametech My modded Xbox has the same case cool.
retrogametech Protect switch was to disable the mod chip if you were playing Xbox Live
retrogametech Do you ever feel bad for getting a really low price on a really rare console?
retrogametech What did you search on ebay? I have an XBOX DVT4 Kit, and I want a modded xbox too.
retrogametech nice pick up dude...yeah the sticky dvd rom dive can be easley over come bye a tapping the top of the console up the just ubove the rom drive b because there was no dvd lock keys for the xbox ones you can just drop in anothere new drive that works
retrogametech Hey dude! Hows things? Yep Ive seen them sell for close to 200. And I regularly get some crazy offers to sell that black one I modded. Got the shelving unit for a tenner at Home Bargains! :)
retrogametech What Ever Happened To That Catchy Tune You Used To Have Playing During Your Videos?
retrogametech I just picked up the exact same thing but halo green edition with a 200 gig hard drive for 80 us dollars
retrogametech Those are cool. Im liking the Mettalica!
retrogametech Haha, thats what I thought. Its been so long since I messed around with anything X3 related. I notice the dip switch panel on my own box has a little protect dip too. Memories coming back now! :P It wasnt explicitly listed as modded and to be fair it was only up for a couple of minutes before I snagged it :P . Suppose it just slipped through the net. Kinda lucky! I see you have a couple of these in black? Do you still use yours much?
retrogametech you dont need a chip to mod the console, i use splinter cell and action replay to mod mine, you put the mod on action replay from your pc, and then your run the mod from within the game using action replay.
retrogametech Aww Dam, I Loved That Playing In The Background hahahahahah
retrogametech I got the same thing from ebay for free
retrogametech Martin, for your sticky dvd drive. Sometimes they arent sticky, but just dont close properly, thus wont open again until closed properly. So just try using the close tray in unleashx, you should hear the drive close, from then onwards it should openclose until switched off again.... Beats the thumbing!
retrogametech is that a dreamcast in your pic
retrogametech Thats not an XBOX... Its a SEXBOX!!! :P Nice mod dude.
retrogametech Is the Xecuter 3 the best mod chip for the original xbox?
retrogametech Where can i get one of these screens because i soo want one on my modded xbox
retrogametech I still have mine with all this on it too, but mine is blue and has a custom Halo Legendary Elite skull center jewel with LEDs, i never use it, thought about selling it many times but glad i keep it :)
retrogametech i have a halo edition that i got as interest from someone
retrogametech Thats pretty cool, and even better that you didnt have to fix it!
retrogametech Awesome find! I always wanted one of these cases after I got my first 2.3b Lite but read somewhere that it would be incompatible with either the screen or just the protection switches. Of course at that time I didnt know half as much about them as I do now. How do the usb ports work exactly? Do they take away one of the ports? Ive always wondered that but never got a hold of one of these official faceplates to figure it out.
retrogametech Modding XBoxes. Its so fun soldering wire to vias while trying to make sense of crap quality photos that may or may not relate to either your XBox or the modchip you bought. I used XBMC on mine for about 3 years and it was great. Now I run XBMC on a jailbroken Apple TV 2 and its equally great  but can decode H.264 video.
retrogametech Ive had people call me Irish. Scotland  Ireland.
retrogametech I have another Xbox with an Xecuter 3 modchip but a faulty drive... Ill need to remove it and install it to my main Xbox!
retrogametech Someones listening to RIDE THE LIGHTNING! fist bumps
retrogametech 8:23 FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS
retrogametech The draw sticks on mine as well .Nice buy my sister chucked her modded xbox out when it stopped reading disk i should have saved it i do have all the baclup games from it.
retrogametech Just bought a Old Megadrive 1 for exactly that Chip, will have to post Videos of the finished product
retrogametech I have to find a burned out ic on mine, so I can relate. I am always interested in this kind of stuff! Any progress is good progress I say, keep at it man, I hope you get it back in order.
retrogametech I keep on watching for updates on this like the stock market or something super excited to see if this ends up working
retrogametech Ive been subscribed to both of Jeris channels for a while now :) . She properly knows her stuff! I watch her vids and try to followunderstand but a lot of what she does is WAY beyond my level of understanding. I clearly have a lot to learn, haha :P. Its still always really interesting to follow her projects.
retrogametech the old battery was a rechargeable one 50mAH, I dont think its a good idea to replace it with a nonrechargeable lithium battery because it will explode when recharged.
retrogametech Never boring Martin :) Taint That The Fuckin Truth!! Just A Stupid, Maybe Useless Idea. If The Chips Get Hot Why Not Try To Add A Small Fan Over Them? A VideoGameConsole Modder, Goes By MODDEDbyBACTERIA Uses Small Fans To Keep CPUs On His Handheld Consoles From Getting Too Hot. Maybe You Could Use A Multimeter And Run A Fan Over The Chips?
retrogametech I suggest before start desoldering the big chips you should find the power and ground of the Yamaha and Z80 chip and cut only those legs first and then power the whole thing up. Cut first the power of Yamaha then test, then if nothing cut ground of Yamaha then test. Cut z80 power and test and etc you should get something on the screen, since these boards do have some BIOS checking . (and install the bios of course...)
retrogametech Classic Game Room have got a 4 cart version of one of these with the cabinet. This board is crawling out of the wood work!
retrogametech Haha, thanks dude! Just got done watching Lukes vid on the Unibios. Definitely going to pick one up as the next step. Im really interested to see how yours will react when you test with Unibios and the missing RAM. With mine Id just like to get it to show anything on screen. Even an error message would be nice! lol I was interested to read about the GenMega similarities too. Someone told me I could even use a Z80 from a model 1 Mega Drive. Ill still need to find a YM2610 though.
retrogametech My bad  skipped around and missed your point about the BIOS :P
retrogametech i have a cdtv which had no video, turned out to be bad caps on the video board, it seems your issue with video may be similar as it seems your tv is picking up a signal, however no RGB from the video stage, with the sound it may be a similar issue, may be worth getting hold of a chip schematic and checking voltages on power pins and use a logic probe to test channel outputs if not just drop in another 2610 or 2608 which is similar
retrogametech take it you are going to desolder the yamaha chip and check below it? id agree that if the battery leaked it may well have leaked in below
retrogametech i cant believe i watched the whole thing.. lol pretty interestin this was.. guys who actually try and bring retro stuff back to life are absolute legends, a service to the history of gaming.. its definitely somethin i wanna get into, have to knick me dads solderer and get crackin on that dead jap MD of mine. :)
retrogametech Good to hear. I thought there was a possibility you might have (wasnt sure). Hence my phrasing.
retrogametech Hey bro, first off you need to pick up a Unibios for that machine, you can get them on eBay for around 30 or type in Universe bios in google and you can find what Im talking about. With the unibios it will show you what is wrong and allow you to force the mvs into aes mode so you can still play the games. Very important other point is that the cart slot NEEDS TO be attached with the game in it, not just the board only
retrogametech Never boring Martin :) The Yamaha sound chip too hot to touch...Id say swap that out but also with my ocd, find out where the soundaudio caps are and replace. Just ordered the UnoBios  after watching Lukes video, its a definite must have. Havent had a chance to test mine out yet...still waiting on the JAMMA harness  unibios. Interesting some of the similarities of the Neo Geo and GenesisMegadrive. Both have a main Motorola 68000 based cpu and a Zilog Z80 cpu to handle sound.
retrogametech Do you know how to fix bill acceptors?
retrogametech Did you ever get this working? Ive done a recent repair to an MV1FZ but luckily I didnt have any battery acid  that stuff is really painful... I suspect you could have damaged tracks under the components nearby, it often doesnt stop just at the battery area and can damage the tracks underneath chips easily.
retrogametech How do you deep clean a motherboard like that?
retrogametech I dont understand most of this but I pick up a few worlds to drop in conversation the sound tech savvy!
retrogametech it looks like its missing a bios chip from the centre there
retrogametech I have no idea what youre talking about but I still watch your videos ).
retrogametech If chips get hot like that, theyve usually shorted out inside. What happens after that can be completely random depending on how the chip died and whats shorted out in it. Try removing the Yamaha chip (its the actual sound chip so beyond making sound it shouldnt be doing anything important) and see what happens. If youre lucky you might get an error telling you the sound chip is missing or bad.
retrogametech I think your floor is on LSD.
retrogametech Im always interested in listening to you ramble for 10 minutes! xD
retrogametech The chips on this board arent advanced enough to require cooling :) The Z80 is the CPU that was inside the ZX Spectrum and runs at a whole 4MHz, and the Yamaha sound chip is just a sound generator and shouldnt even warm up. It wasnt until the mid 90s that CPUs ran fast enough (and consumed enough power) that theyd get hot enough to need cooling.
retrogametech good vid dude ! always worth a watch !
retrogametech hell yes I want to get a MVS too and will prob get a cheap one with faults to fix up so this will be very helpful ty :)
retrogametech Lol! EVERYONE is repairing these things lately.
retrogametech Yea since everyone is so proper Im gonna be the vulgar yank lol if u dont wanna hear martin talk about electronic repairs fuck off !
retrogametech I think, if you both dont already know of her, you would both gain a lot of info about electronics and games computers like amigas etc if you were to look at the videos made by (and made about) the very popular youtuber Jeri Ellsworth watch?veFzsyQOTXbM watch?vcLy0mVkoLio
retrogametech You can take a Z80 out of a dead Model 1 Mega DriveGenesis or even an old Master System. Ive seen a bunch of them Z80s die for no reason. Whats the voltage on pin 57 (SCS) of the YM2610 when the systems running? If its somewhere between 2 and 4 volts, the Z80 is accessing it properly. Is the voltage on pins 19, 28, and 62 5 volts? if not it may be shorted out.
retrogametech I had the same problem with my MVS i got, I didnt have an JAMMA connector so i had to solder directly from the pins to the SCART. When i tried it on both of my TVs it switched to the channel but no picture, same problem as you. I then changed the sync pin on the scart from 20 to 19 and i got picture :).
retrogametech Lol, well thats good to know!
retrogametech Lol, well I think you deserve a round of applause making it all the way through :P . You should definitely give it a go! Its really not that difficult. Very rewarding when you manage to fix something!
retrogametech Maybe there is a trace coroded under the DIPIC beside the Battery. The acid seems to like to spread underneath parts unfortunately.
retrogametech Have you got an AES? I find the AES much more appealing, maybe because the cartridges have labels :o)
retrogametech Ill make that vid now
retrogametech The board will not do anything without a bios chip installed.
retrogametech Is the PSU giving enough power to the entire board? I repair old MSDOS computers and sometimes the seller added a card to the motherboard and it exceeded the power supply.
retrogametech i have a question if you ever find a sega cd 1 pal could i pleas buy it?
retrogametech Probably worth swapping the capacitors with some new ones as the old ones might be broken. ASSEMberX has a good guide! watch?vUY5ouIXVQc
retrogametech AES I mean, I dont have a MVS.
retrogametech anyone who finds martin boring when talking about something education like eletronic shouldnt even be on his channel. martin, keep doing your thing man. your videos are great!!
retrogametech I would imagine the PCB could be multilayer board so you might not see all the corroded traces inside the board. Challenging project it seems. Good luck!
retrogametech A 10 minute quick update? Still watched the whole thing though
retrogametech Who doesnt like faulty electronics talk? Sucks that it isnt working, but at this point, I would be either all in or all out. The YM2610 and Z80 shouldnt be too expensive, and if youre going to go to that much trouble, you may as well replace the caps while youre at it. Even after all that, you could still end up with a non working board. I love old electronics.
retrogametech Epic your videos are brilliant very interesting information. I watch another guy from America called Ben Heck who also mods technology and regenerates retro hardware good stuff addictive watching thanks for making them.
retrogametech Does it have to Port on the back of it for the MegaDrive MODEM?
retrogametech If Robot Chicken hasnt done anything with these things, they should. XDIm pretty sure Nintendo had a line of these as well, available around the same time.
retrogametech I just got this from eBay a couple of days ago! Looks awesome for something that tiny! Just gotta get the Mega CD32X combo and it will be complete! :D
retrogametech shut up and take my money!!!!!!!!!!!
retrogametech Theyre adorable!But are they edible?Ill eat anything!
retrogametech This is awesome, I was thinking on this days ago, its nice to know that actually it existed, but I wish I could have them in hands.
retrogametech thats to small how can u play that dude
retrogametech liksang was a great import store. sony shut it down with its lawyers. sucks!
retrogametech that is a really neat little toy.
retrogametech your channel is amazing!
retrogametech So when are you going to repair it?
retrogametech What was that in the 32x?
retrogametech You mentioned LikSang... how I miss that place.
retrogametech Damn I want one of these great little addition to my collection, how much do these go for whenever they pop up on places like ebay
retrogametech Lol, thats a good question!
retrogametech I dont do much with the 360 these days sorry. I should have an original Xbox project soon though :)
retrogametech It would be awesome if those little machines actually worked,imagine carrying all your favourite systems in your pocket...
retrogametech This is like what your parents got you if you were jealous of your sisters Barbie playhouse. lol
retrogametech Is that a fire extinguisher in your room? Lol
retrogametech Those are so fing cool! Man id end up spending retarded amounts of money on those hahaha.
retrogametech I wish there was a tiny cables to go with it,and then purchase different cartirdges. That would be awesome.
retrogametech Awww that is the cutest thing I have ever seen! I want one!!! :D
retrogametech If it worked that would be ... GODLY!
retrogametech He got this one from Ebay, he said it at the start of the video. There is a video on the other one he has and I think he mentioned where he got that one from as well.
retrogametech Epic find dude, hows that AES coming on?
retrogametech Eggs....Sega.....oh, I see what you did there. You so silly, Sega!
retrogametech I got a DS that is from the Nintendo collection
retrogametech lol that is awesome, Id love to have a mini Dreamcast for my collection
retrogametech When I get these for my Action Man, he is gonna FREAK.
retrogametech I bet you had to shell out a lot of dough for that p
retrogametech All my pockets would be full then
retrogametech Haha no way. I didnt even know they existed. And its japanese model too. I must this collection.
retrogametech No, it was actually pretty cheap! I paid around 8 total. And Id just sold a 3DS game I didnt like so had spare credit sitting in my PayPal. So technically it was free :P
retrogametech Awwww that is sooooo adorable!!!!! Maybe they bring good luck!
retrogametech Very cool. I have never seen them before.
retrogametech These things are fantastic, I have the entire set.
retrogametech Just check a lot and frequently :P
retrogametech can I borrow your shrink ray? :p
retrogametech Thats really awesome! :D
retrogametech Hows the game play on it? LOL
retrogametech Honey I shrunk the mega drive.
retrogametech Irony is the cord on them little pads is longer than the cords on my real pads :P
retrogametech do they have these for systems like the NES and SNES?
retrogametech How do you get these stuff? I live in Japan but those are impossible to find here...
retrogametech Lol, Ill need to find some video game related action figures to pose them with it XD
retrogametech Risky Ride is my fave Outrun song!
retrogametech I just ordered a NeoGeo from ebay, but it didnt come with a cartridge and I know they exist. I just have to figure out what kind of ebay search will pull these things up.
retrogametech now all you need is a Vending egg TV to play it
retrogametech Lol, that would be awesome! But imagine trying to keep track of all those tiny cartridges! :P
retrogametech Ive seen those floating about on eBay and they are super cute querky items :D
retrogametech Yeah there was a Nintendo History Collection set very much in the same way as these. Fortunately I managed to get them when Playasia was still selling them a few years back. However Im still kicking myself that I never managed to get the Sega collection lol.
retrogametech you should make a video about it :)
retrogametech many video games contain easter eggs,..however, these easter eggs contain video games.
retrogametech Where did you find this?!
retrogametech I can feel the SEGA love.
retrogametech This is the greatest nerdgasm Ive ever experienced...
retrogametech Must resist the urge to start hunting these down!!
retrogametech I had no idea they had all of the Sega consoles featured in such way. Looks like you got more to hunt down now.
retrogametech Haha, the Dreamcast even has its own miniature removable VMUs! WANT!! XD
retrogametech I want to tease you and call you a nerd, but Id be lying if I said I didnt want them too:) Oh know, now you need to get another one to display with the Power Base Converter. Was that genuine excitement in your voice when you snapped the Mega Drive and Mega CD together? I like the forced perspective view at the end.
retrogametech Does any one know any good ways to store xbox360 and ps3 games Does any one know any good shops in the UK to purchase a video game shelf like the one in this video?
retrogametech The machines selling things like this are all over the place here in Japan. Of course they have newer systems these days, but its still pretty cool. If you want to come hang out in Japan Ill show you things that will blow your mind.
retrogametech That is just so adorable! Cool stuff man, I never got anything good in those egg things.
retrogametech I bet if you took todays best hardware tech, you could probably make real working consoles that size! lol
retrogametech Oh yeah!!!!! Just AWESOME!!!!!! Just imagine if I could just make some money off people buying scale models of the bikes I ride from vending machine sales.
retrogametech Congratulations on completing the set. When the panel opened up to reveal an actual scale expansion port edge connector, it was a little mindblowing. You almost expect it to have traces painted on.
retrogametech i want one! thats too cool
retrogametech Yep and theres a Nintendo collection too :) .
retrogametech Damn it!... you got me! :P But dont pretend like you wouldnt do the same!
retrogametech Admit it : you play these and pretend youre a giant......
retrogametech Congrats for finding that nice replica! Awesome video like always...I think Im going to turno on my megadrive and play some Sonic the Hedgehog. :P
retrogametech Looks like an adaptor for Sega Channel, which was a cable TV based service for downloading games. I think he made a video about it and Sega Retro has rather a long article too, if youre interested.
retrogametech awesome...love how it all fits together, wow, that cartirdge is cool as hell, so detailed
retrogametech I use to work with plastic injection mold machines. Can you imagine how long it took to tool that mold for those miniature models.Cool, Thanks.
retrogametech You got to do a vid on that, dude! XD Id love to see the Dreamcast and Master System versions!
retrogametech These days they could make a real working one in that size, and if they used a Micro SD Card in the cart you could have every game ever made all packaged in one tiny little unit :)
retrogametech Thats so cool. Technology being what it is these days, they could probably make a functional Megadrive clone that size. Id buy one :D
retrogametech Very cool, I have the mini version of the famicom and some games with boxes, its pretty neat
retrogametech i wonder how the blast processing handles !
retrogametech i am f....... liking this video
retrogametech Lol. Aww man... why did you have to go and point that out! You know my OCD tendencies mean Ill now have to go hunt down another just to display the Power Base! Haha. And yes, that was indeed some genuine unscripted nerdy excitement. Dont act like you wouldnt be the same! :P
retrogametech What do the prices go for on those 40 in 1 carts
retrogametech I got all the power wiring done after making this vid. Just got video and sound to do next. Taking my time and double checking everything as I go. So many unknownuntested variables to consider with something like this. But it is kinda fun! :) I really want to play those games on that cart now! I got the cart on eBay (what a surprise eh?). It was more or less the same price as a single sports game.
retrogametech Not decided yet. It kinda depends on if I can get it work right now. I might consider building a mini cab or making some sort of console style housing for it.
retrogametech Booo you should have got a multi cart with Super Dodge Ball!
retrogametech Excellent progress on the MVS! Very lovely multicart too. Are you planning to build this into a cabinet of some sorts?
retrogametech Lucky you! I wish the AES wasnt so expensive! :P
retrogametech I guess youll be the guy to speak to if I need any spare parts then, lol. Yeah, those vias are what worry me. I dont want to have to start running wires from one side of the board to the other! Any suggestions on the best place to pickup a UniBios chip from?
retrogametech Please reply to my PM Martin :)
retrogametech Haha I saw this video and thought it was one of Lukes videos until I heard your voice.
retrogametech Looking good! Nearly bought a neo geo console myself the other week, this may ignite more interest lol
retrogametech Would love to see how the traces get repaired.
retrogametech Great stuff bro, one thing I totally made a mistake on is this. For the mvs 1 slot you can use a regular jamma cable, no sound wire switch necessary. I cant believe I forgot about that. With multi slot boards you have to do this but that single slot board shouldnt need any messing around with, just make sure to hook up that 5v line so you can play jamma boards with sound
retrogametech Cool! You should make some vids!
retrogametech I can almost guarantee there will be more hiccups. There always are! :P
retrogametech Someone was nice enough to send me a busted one for nothing, Kenn6265. It can be brought back from the dead though. I need to find and replace the burned out ic and replace the missing LED. I made a big special video about it and its a rare Korean one! Since all SNK hardware is region free it doesnt matter, and it uses Japanese, or US BIOS I dont know yet since I cant turn it on. I wish I lived near you, I would pay to to fix it for me lol. I have wanted one all my life. Youll get one :)
retrogametech Nice to see that you have made a little bit of progress. I dont know why it is that I find arcade repair so interesting. Where did you pick up the multicart?
retrogametech best of luck, I hope it will work out for you!
retrogametech Seems a cool little project youve got yourself there,and great that your getting advice from Luke.I always wanted an MVS cab myself.What are you going to be doing in the way of controllers?
retrogametech Thanks! fingers crossed I can revive it :)
retrogametech It depends on how many and what games are on the cart. From what Ive seen they typically go for between 2080.
retrogametech A mini cab would be cool but Im not sure I have the space. Ill probably go with building a housing of some sort for it. After seeing some gameplay of the games on that multicart I really want to get this working again so I can have a shot! :P
retrogametech Hope you get it working, Luke is extremely knowledgeable and has a ton of experience.
retrogametech respect to luke love his channel too
retrogametech For the broken track either link it from the via to the chip pin on the bottom of the pcb or scratch off the solder resist from the track to expose it, then run a single core link wire across the break and paint on some new resist (total track replacement repair).
retrogametech What are you going to house the console in?
retrogametech You can but you need to watch out as some dishwasher have a super hot rinse cycle plus they wont clean a PCB than a toothbrush can.
retrogametech You can ask Luke anything and hell give you a cool long answer hes a retro legend!!!!!!!
retrogametech Awesome video as always!!! Cool project you got on your hands. These types of video are the best!!! Thanks!!!
retrogametech Cool stuff man. Luke is a solid guy and takes the time to help out. Another good vid man:)
retrogametech I hope you get this board working as im not familiar with Neo Geo hardwate or anything.
retrogametech luke morse is a geezer! good luck on the project do love your vids!
retrogametech For now Im just going to get the power and video hooked up. If I see signs of life then Ill probably use my Xbox 360 Hori arcade stick for the controls. It shouldnt be difficult to wire it up.
retrogametech Good stuff man. I myself have a AES I need to start working on, someday.
retrogametech It sounds like there is still a glimmer of interest in these boards for you, seeing how, despite your hardware being in the loft, that you are watching this video. I for one am finding it rewarding just reading both positive and negative comments on the boards.
retrogametech Remove any socketed chips (Like the bios) and give the board a good wash with soap and warm water using a toothbrush to scrub. Let it drip dry in the vertical position for 30 minutes then put it in the sun for about 2 hours. You might need to use canned air to get the water out from under the chips to dry good. Make sure the board is completely dry before powering it on again.
retrogametech Ive heard of people putting their PCBs in the dishwasher to achieve the same goal. Is this true, and is it sane to do so?
retrogametech Great vid man, looking forward to seeing it in action which Im sure you will, you sound determined lol. Its cool that you have fans willing enough to help you that are in the know with these types of things also cool that you gave the guy credit i bet he feels awesome right about now!. I am in need of some help I feel you might be the one to go to....you up for it?
retrogametech Thanks for the tips. Ive got it drip drying right now.
retrogametech Ive got a load of these in the loft. I just got bored of fixing them, they are just a pain in the arse, especially the multi slot boards. Heres a hint though, if you stick a UniBios in there you can bypass a few of the error messages like calendar ram and backup ram errors. Also check plated through holes and make sure to check for broken traces under the PCB from poor handling. Good luck!
retrogametech Haha I would usually frown upon the 48in1 cart, but I must admit I have one myself for my arcade cabinet, but possibly has 80 games on it, not at home at the mo, mvs carts whilst cheaper than aes carts, are still very expensive :(
retrogametech See it all clean up and ready to go.
retrogametech I have those exact same 3d glasses, but they do NOT work as well as the OEM SEGA glasses, which I also have. I found that the 3D effect is not as good, that you still get some of the double vision that you get wearing no glasses.
retrogametech Do you have to be a certain distance from the TV for it to work? I need to sit close as I cant see well!
retrogametech Thats awesome. Do you buy stuff from craiglist type of sites, not caunting ebay and everything else.
retrogametech Wow I got a complete master system in my celler complete in box I bought it years and years ago on clearance for 30.00 usd I never played it. Because I had a working one. I may have to dig it out and put it on ebay.
retrogametech Well, the Famicom and SMS glasses work on eachother, so it should work. The reason I just said Almost definately is because I havent actually tried it myself.
retrogametech 1:07 did you just read my mind lol? I was like I wonder what that is in dollars?
retrogametech Ive been wanting a pair for my sms! Thanks for this video because im not paying all that for a pair of broken sms 3D glasses!
retrogametech What keywords would you use in an eBay search? 3D LCD glasses? Shutter glasses? You didnt really specify or give a link.
retrogametech A great way to save some money. I suppose having a working pair means you could try getting an official pair but wouldnt have to worry about getting a working set. More of a display piece.
retrogametech Awesome!! Love master system!!!
retrogametech I got some official Sega master system 3d glasses for 30 boxed and complete with polystyrene inserts, manual, mint condition glasses (no cracks), 3d adaptor and the lead!
retrogametech Asus vr100g glasses will also work with the Sega 3D Adaptor and they are a bit larger than the Sega versions for those who need the larger width.
retrogametech Quite surprised a modern 3d shutter glasses would work with master system adapter!
retrogametech See, I thought I remembered you mentioning this, haha. Thanks for the idea! :)
retrogametech Keep make videos lots and lots
retrogametech Totally worth checking out! I actually wear glasses a lot of the time as well. But the cool thing is these 3D frames are designed to fit over regular glasses. They fit over the top of mine no problem. Youll just end up looking a bit special while playing your Master System. Good times!
retrogametech Ive got the official glasses, I got them relatively cheap. Unfortunately theyre too small for my head! I will get some of these, Im surprised this works!
retrogametech At the moment the only 3D game I have is Missile Defence which is built into the system. Space Harrier 3D is supposed to be pretty good though. Ill probably pick it up since its one of the more common 3D titles. Space Harrier on the Saturn is excellent! I have it on a compilation with Outrun and AfterBurner. Its supposedly an arcade perfect port.
retrogametech Your videos are great :D glad you putting out more videos oh and you have not seem to have updated your backloggery
retrogametech lol yeah i know, i just thought that phrase was really funny :P
retrogametech Thanks to you, I will be able too! :)
retrogametech Just search for 3D LCD shutter glasses. You should get a few hits.
retrogametech Nicely done! Yeah, the official glasses can be really expensive! Its interesting that the Japanese Master Systems dont need that 3D adapter unit. I want to get one, partly because you can play Sega SG1000 games on it, and thats a REALLY expensive retro console!
retrogametech I know a lot of people who are huge fans of the SMS and want those 3D glasses, but not the price would love this! I am going to tell them about it, great stuff man.
retrogametech so would this work for the famicom?
retrogametech Some questions: 1.Could you please say exactly how is called the glasses that are you using on your video? I wish order this glases but I want be sure that they will work with my sega master. 2. Do you need a crt monitor for get working properly the 3d effect with your sega? 3. Do you get a perfect effect? I mean, do you not perceive double images some times? I own the original 3d glasses,. Back on time the effect was perfect, but now sometimes I perceive double images because they aged. 3.
retrogametech I had the same problem at first! I thought maybe the glasses werent compatible but it turned out the contact pins inside the adapter were dirty and needed bent back into place. I should maybe have mentioned and shown this in the vid. I was really surprised how good the 3D effect works on such an old 8bit system! I actually shouted Holy st! when I first saw it working properly, lol. Now I want to hunt down more of the supported games. Have you got any recommendations?
retrogametech Unfortunately those arent LCD shutter glasses. Theyre the passive polarised type and wont work with the Master System.
retrogametech those came with the x3d extreme 3d system for pc. i got it free but never really tried them.
retrogametech YES I too got those as a backup to my original 3D Glasses.
retrogametech Those are pretty ugly. I wanna try that one day though!
retrogametech Thought I got away with it )
retrogametech Tell me about it. I can see the 3D effect from here! (Just a little jokey poos there)
retrogametech i have a megadrive exuiped with a master system converter and iu plugged the 3d adapter in i know it works but who wants to borrow me a few games
retrogametech Just wondering, do you have Space Harrier 3d? If so, how is the 3d effect on it? I have Space Harrier for Sega Saturn and it plays really well with the 3d controller.
retrogametech Its like the pause on a VHS tape! The image isnt actually still but judders slightly. Or as Eddie Izzard called it the Lacukaracha button!
retrogametech Cool, Will have to try and track down a 3D adapter and dig out my MS1.
retrogametech You could sit on the floor directly in front of your TV and still see the 3D effect. I was walking around the room while playing and the 3D effect looked great! So distance isnt really a problem.
retrogametech Excellent vid dude, nice heads up on the glasses :D
retrogametech Same here :) . I wonder how hard it would be to hack one of the wireless sets of glasses to work with the 3D adapter? That would be even cooler!
retrogametech Ive got three pairs of the glasses, my main issue is theyre made for kids, so youll need to have a small head or the arms that are brittle as all hell will easily snap off. But do these glasses have a model name at all? They should also work on famicom 3D games.
retrogametech Cool. I probably would never have gotten to try out the Master Systems 3D if it wasnt for these cheap glasses XD
retrogametech I have a pair of the modern shutter glasses as well, and I can tell you that they are far more comfortable. I believe that most of the trouble with the SEGA 3D glasses actually comes from the adapter nowadays. I noticed that the image was affected by bumping the adapter one day, so I opened it up to see what was wrong. The metal contacts in the jack needed to be adjusted to make a better connection, and now both sets of glasses work great.
retrogametech Punorama! You have no principles p
retrogametech I have the standalone japanese release on saturn of space harrier (which I had purchased first) and the sega ages usa release with outrun and afterburner.
retrogametech Let me ask for the people that have these 3d games. Is worth the investment ?or are there more of a novelty??? What gamegames are worth it?
retrogametech Google Logisys CLK4WT2 4 Dual White Cold Cathode Kit those would of fit perfectly for what you needed. etherway keep up the great work.
retrogametech It was close! Literally less than a mm worth of clearance at just the right angle. I thought I was going to snap the ends off a few times :P Where to put it? I really have no idea! lol I dont have the space at the moment. Hopefully in future when I get a place with a dedicated games room it can go on display with the rest of my geeky tat! :) 1st world problems, eh?
retrogametech looks good, glad you got it working
retrogametech neat videos. does it get hot or stinky?
retrogametech very nice light fix on the ngage sign i like your videos did you have to take the whole thing apart i guess that it was a project for you to do
retrogametech Thanks! Im pretty pleased I got it back to its original working condition :)
retrogametech The NGage has no video out so doubtful its possible. Cool idea though :)
retrogametech Yup, any old clock that uses 7 Segment displays will work. :)
retrogametech Its not that I didnt listen to the suggestions, Its more that I can really afford to undertake a project like that right now. I just went with the cheapest option to restore it to its original working state. The other problem would be dismantling it to fit a photo screen inside. The way its constructed means it would near enough have to be destroyed to gain access. These things were never meant to be serviced so opening them up isnt really an option without damaging it.
retrogametech I was considering do this. It wouldnt be too difficult to convert the countdown display to a real clock. Maybe a future project if I find a cheap donor clock :)
retrogametech There seems to be a bit of empty space in there, it would be awesome if you could modify it to be a working telephone.
retrogametech Bad ass shit bro good job
retrogametech What a lovely oversized night light!
retrogametech Haha, I think peeps might start to think I was a little egotistical if I did something like that :P
retrogametech you know, they do make smaller florescent tubes like that, a pc case i ordered came with one that was about half the size. so that might be something to look for next time space is an issue.
retrogametech What would have been awesome, stick a cheap laptop in there, and run NGage emulated games on it. and also get the buttons to work too. and you have the worlds largest NGage!!!
retrogametech Looks really good now its all fixed up! I wonder if its possible to find any of the inserts that would have been used with it.
retrogametech Just search ebay or amazon for CCFL kit and you should see a bunch of options. You can get all sorts of sizes and colours etc.
retrogametech Yes, but can you fix the NGauge from sucking 100 though? That is the question lol. Good stuff man.
retrogametech I would put Sonic N in there
retrogametech I can see this being used a comiccon not as an attendee thou, have it displaying something directly related to what your doing there
retrogametech Fantastic job Martin ! Looks awesome. I love how it illuminates that playstation insert, The flash from Dukes guns looks amazing ! Top stuff dude :)
retrogametech Great vid. Did you get the Duke Nuke Em cover out...?
retrogametech You have done a nice job but i think youve missed a real trick not listening to those people that suggested you put a video or photo player playing ngage images that would have been really cool.
retrogametech Hahaha, What is it with YouTubers always wanting to either grow or hide weed in my consolesmods? lol
retrogametech Modify the clock to work as a clock and use this as a night lamp :)
retrogametech Bummer, that always to me. Just when I think Ive got it, I break it. I didnt think there was any chance you would be able to get those tubes in there. It looks nice, but where the heck would you display something like that?
retrogametech Theoretically, If I had an unlimited amount of money how much would you sell every game, console and awesome tech gadget you owned for?
retrogametech Could you give a linkproduct info for the lights please? Thanks :)
retrogametech Put a android tablet or ereader in it and put a bunch of game emulators on it
retrogametech Lol, I had to take the front screen off again! hahaha. Wont be doing that again :P
retrogametech Looks great, well done.
retrogametech Awesome . You any good at replaceing ipod touch glass screens . If so how much if you could .
retrogametech i would grow weed in it and use the count down to tell me when its ready lol
retrogametech Thanks dude! Would love to find some of the original promo flyers for it :) . Now, off to hunt down that giant GameGear you mentioned :P
retrogametech Yeah but its the kinda thing you wouldnt think would be an issue until you actually got around to fitting. The tubes I bought are identical in size to what was already in there. I just assumed there wouldnt be a problem in a direct replacement. Will keep those shorter tubes in mind for next time though )
retrogametech I cannot help but look at this giant NGage thing and wonder how it might look if modded to accommodate that NeoGeo arcade board (with a screen added of course).
retrogametech Thanks! Sadly I doubt Ill ever find any of the original inserts. Stuff like that always ends up in the bin. But you never know :P
retrogametech What about fitting the engage innards with a big screen? Possible? It would look funny as playing it with big Kenny Everett hands!
retrogametech Or people will argue that the store like gamespot will lose money, even though they pretty much screw the developers and customers when it comes to selling used games, and trading in games lol.
retrogametech Sweet, Ill need to check that out. Ive mostly just been messing around with GBA roms so far.
retrogametech Check out a site called Ebluar. They have them for a pretty good price.
retrogametech Just ordered one of these after watching your review. To be honest, a fellow Brit saying its good sealed the deal. Bought mine from Germany through PayPal to be safe. And I am so glad someone else shares my views on downloading ROMs for oldgen consoles. The only people making money are the scalpers or excollectors that bought them all up. Still trying to get a cheap Blood Omen 1 legit though.
retrogametech also, the L button skip thing: when you power cycle the ez4, it then tries to save from the nand memory to the sd card. if you skip it, boom goes your previous sessions saves. of course if you had saved earlier, then those will be available, just not the recent ones. gameboy and gameboy color games can be emulated with goomba and goombacolor.
retrogametech They can, but they do it by detecting if its a GBA Cartridge or a GBGBC Cartridge. Since this is a GBA Cartridge, it goes into GBA Mode and only plays GBA ROMs. If this was a GBGBC Cartridge, it would go into GBGBC Mode, and would only play GBGBC ROMs.
retrogametech Im definitely picking one of these up, along with a Gameboy Micro :)
retrogametech Dam, Ive Been Wanting One Of Those For Testing.
retrogametech Hi mate richard here that cart in your gba are u selling it i have a ds light and.just ordered a r4. Cart for ds games but want one to play the gba games on the ds gba slot
retrogametech You have the coolest shit Man...Bravo on a great new tech I had no idea that it existed!thanks Bro. :)
retrogametech The only question I have with this is can you play online with friends in games such as pokemon? Thanks!
retrogametech I went out and bought this the day you posted this video. Super excited for it finally came in the mail and sort of disappointed. I can figure out how to get this thing saving. in configuration it has save mode and it says auto and forced I tried both but it doesnt keep any saves. I save in game, I quit. I start another game save that. come back to the first game, no more saved data... Any help?
retrogametech I heard about things like this for the NES and SNES and stuff but is it possible to get flash carts like this for consoles such as N64?
retrogametech I do not have this, so I cannot say for sure, but it should be perfect, as it is not emulation. It is running them nativly, so everything should be 100 perfect
retrogametech Does this mean if I have already patched mother 3 in English that I could actually really play it on my GBA instead of an emulator?
retrogametech Did you transfer the roms to your memory card with the EZFlash software using a PC? The ROMS need to be patched and the EZClient software also has to create a special folder with save files etc.
retrogametech I got my miniSD  microSD converter stuck in mine. Im still able to remove the microSD card inside, but I cannot get the converter out at all. Rather nice flashcart, software was fairly easy to use, etc. Make sure you dont skip the starting saver bit because that is it reading back from the SRAM and writing that to the SD card, it doesnt do direct to SD writes in game. If you skip it, next game you load will overwrite the SRAM. Where did you get that GBC one though?
retrogametech Any idea where i can buy this. Money is not a big problem
retrogametech How did you get one of these? I heard that its illegal to buy, sell, or advertise them in the UK and Ireland.
retrogametech dang... i wish you were my father, haha!
retrogametech nice xbox in the background
retrogametech Yes Mother 3 works on it, and it is even better since you can patch a mother 3 ROM to English and play the English version. To play Mother 3 , select the game and press SELECT, then A. This will permenantly write to your cartridge, and will then load up instantly.
retrogametech Will It work with Pokemon chaos black
retrogametech If memory servers correctly down by the cartage contacts there is a little switch that gets hit when you put in a normal Game Boy game, when a GBA game is put in the switch is not pushed down and the system goes in to GBA mode. I wonder if you could put in a ROM for a normal Game Boy and have something push the little switch down to make the GBA start in GB mode.
retrogametech from where did you buy it ? I wanted a trusted website...
retrogametech why a save battery if its flash memory?
retrogametech hey, u have the same gba sp as Tweeterman287s XD
retrogametech is the super card gba good?
retrogametech Nice! Only problem is Im having a very hard time finding one to buy online. Ebay included. No one seems to have them. Where could I buy one today?
retrogametech where do you live? there is one buy a different company on amazon uk, just search gba flash you should be able to spot it
retrogametech the reset option is good so you can save your game even if the battery is dead
retrogametech Did the software run on a mac ?
retrogametech You know Martin, you can play game boy and game boy color games using Goomba and Goomba color. They work fine for me, and if you are having trouble with it, check out wildwolfGs tutorial. Also, you can find a EZflash iv at the realhotstuff for  3035.
retrogametech managed to add some cheats to the games? if not, check out gbaatm.
retrogametech where can i get a gamebox
retrogametech I have this flash cart and I love it.
retrogametech I buyed one one year ago.Very nice...
retrogametech does that software work on mac os x? Or only windows eh?
retrogametech You made me download Klonoa
retrogametech Thats cool man. How much does it cost?
retrogametech Has anyone used the Mother 3 english rom with this?
retrogametech managed to add some cheats to the games? if not, check out gbaatm.

retrogametech does that software work on mac os x? Or only windows eh?
retrogametech You made me download Klonoa
retrogametech Thats cool man. How much does it cost?
retrogametech I have almost 40 games for my GBA and hauling them all around with me really sucks because the case is about the size of a small purse. I feel ridiculous carrying it around with me. With this thing I can have all the games I own and dont own in one cart and leave all the other physical games at home. Having tons of cartridge games really destroys the portability of a console. I need one of these.
retrogametech Has anyone used the Mother 3 english rom with this?
retrogametech Is there a device for a Sega Megadrive which works the same way?
retrogametech why dont you mod your agb to backlight?? good vid
retrogametech Yes, search for EverDrive. You can get them for most retro consoles :)
retrogametech I used to have a GBA with a flashcart but nowadays I use a modded PSP, the battery lasts way longer than the almost dead battery of my GBA, and the game compatibility is actually better, not to mention all the other consoles I can also play with it.
retrogametech N0 I am sorry my fellow mac user ,but you will have to set up boot camp or run it threw wine.
retrogametech Where the heck did you find this?
retrogametech Thanks, dude! I got the EZ from a Chinese site called ebluar. Although It seems to be down right now. The GB USB I bought from Kitsch Bent in the US. Both sources are very reliable :) (in my experience).
retrogametech Could i use this to play snes on my GBA?
retrogametech i modded my ds lite so it only has a bottom screen. do you think it can run a snes emulator on this flash cart?
retrogametech What is going on with that Xbox in the background and where can I get one please.
retrogametech I was aware of SFII, but just thought all these flash cards had these sort of issues. Will the EZ Flash play Monkey Ball Jr? I have never seen that game emulated correctly. Also, will the GB USB smart card work in a Micro? Really, the only reason I bought a Supercard was because I had a dinky little Micro,  I wanted everything all in one small portable handheld  no extra carts. I always wanted the Micro to be backwards compatible with the GBGBC anyway, smooth NES emulation was just a bonus.
retrogametech Can this work in gameboy player on gamecube
retrogametech I agree, the gameboy games run flawlessly. The odd game like Shantae may not work but the vast majority will run perfect on the ez flash 4. Better than purchasing another flashcart for sure.
retrogametech He shows in the video that it does!!
retrogametech I live in the USA, is there any place online I can buy one of these? And Do they play all GBA games including Japanese Imports?
retrogametech Does anyone know of something like this but it also plays GBC and original GB games? I would love to have one for my DS.
GameSack a big Meeting of old School heads. Too bad i live in Germany. I bet that Metal Jesus Rocks, Angry Video Game Nerd and the Nostalgia Critic will be there too.
GameSack Crap... I live in German :(
GameSack I will be the reason they have hangovers if anyone is wondering
GameSack Dear Game Sack ....hiThat is all xoxoxo
GameSack The Gaming Historian FTW!!!
GameSack Distance between Saarbruecken and Arlington from 8080 miles is unfortunately too big for me... :(
GameSack Im gonna be at PRGE, but I cant get all the way to Texas!
GameSack Only people id wanna see is you guys. Wish Happy Console Gamer was gonna be there. Granted I live in texas so ill probably go.
GameSack Super cool. Ill be living in Texas by then and Im planning on attending Retropalooza as well. Hope to see you guys there.
GameSack Have fun there guys! And if you have time, when you get back, why not make a short video for those of us who cannot attend to let us know what you found there that was interesting. And thanks for the last video. I love how you guys tend to make every video these days at least 25 minutes long. They really are like episodes, and while I love genre videos, the console ones are my favorites!
GameSack I hope they are as awkward in real life as they are on camera! For some strange reason though I wouldnt want it any other way.
GameSack It was a great time last year. Cant wait for this! We will see you there!
GameSack Have fun. Check the back seat for Sonic before you go. Maybe under the car too.
GameSack wish i could go. you and alphaomegasin make it worth it
GameSack Few hour drive for me but Im thinking about it! Well now that you guys are going ... prob not.
GameSack Just sold all my old systems, a part of me is sad and I always say to myself that I want to go back and play them, but I never really do. The few times I have gotten around to play old games, I just realise weve moved on so much and my childhood often gets ruined when I realise theyre actually bad. I remember loving MGS and it being my favourite game ever at the time, but going back........ just not a good game and I never even remembered it being only like 4 hours of actual gameplay lol.I miss my Dreamcast and N64 the most, but in reality Shenmue is just really bad and most N64 games have superior later versions. Goldeneye just isnt good any more and really Mario 64 and OoT have been surpassed and Mario Kart 64 is actually quite crap, Mario Kart 8 just looks so amazing.I have all these memories in my head of these games being amazing, I love watching them all back and remembering them, when it comes to playing though...... games today are a lot better, on the whole.
GameSack Dang live nowhere near there.....
GameSack I cant wait to go to my first convention.. someday..
GameSack Crap! I have to pick one convention. This, CGE, or Portland. This decision has become pretty hard.
GameSack Now if only you could come to San Antonio...Or Austin. Austins cool. But seriously. San Antonio.
GameSack Shame I am unable to attend but if you guys are ever at a convention anywhere on the east I would totally be there. Best of luck.
GameSack Sounds legit! I might have to check it out this year! Would be fun to talk to some other fun to talk to people!! Yeah... lol
GameSack Good luck to all of you.
GameSack 0  10 plz 2 releees new gaym sak
GameSack Cool, I live about 45 minutes away from Arlington.
GameSack If money wasnt an issue, Id love to see you guys at Classic Gaming Expo. Its the week prior in Vegas.
GameSack What were you guys laughing at just before this video started?
GameSack I wish i could come to meet up with yall and play some games
GameSack I may actually go. (I live about 15 minutes from Arlington in the DFW area) Never been to any roundup gig like this. Ive been in the game scene since 1983 or so. (Created 3 or 4 myself) YES Im almost as old as you two!  DPerhaps Ill fork over 20 bux and head out. Ill put it on my calender... Wait, I got to get one first. Dang.. !Chow  Sonic Mario mixed breed duo!
GameSack texas is so far aways :(....come get me in PA on your way down and ill be able to go lol
GameSack Joe please bring Neo Turf Masters on the AES for me!!! Thanks man!!!
GameSack The Game Chasers got no love from game sack hahaha. like the Highlander, there can be only one...Duo on Youtube!
GameSack Im actually going to try but only if Joe is mean to me and mocks me. If he doesnt Ill feel ripped off. Still, together with Joe we will hold a Sega party to make Dave feel terrible about his Nintendo choices. We will mock him roundly then slow dance to the theme of Joes choice.
GameSack Would love to go to see you guys, although I live in Australia, so that will probably never happen. Anyway good luck guys I hope things go well for you and you get to meet a bunch of great fans.
GameSack Shirt is trippin me out
GameSack Dave you fucking suck dick holes. Go fuck your self and lick game sac. Asshole.
GameSack alpha mega sin is .. only complaining on his channel... he is lame
GameSack Go to So Cal. Thx bye.... I wish :(
GameSack Dave, we can see right through you!
GameSack Pretty sure The Game Chasers put on Retropalooza right?
GameSack Wish i could attend i wouldnt mind meeting you two.
GameSack Come to Portland in October for the expo!
GameSack You guys are hilariously great. Visit the northeast sometime!
GameSack I wish I could go that sounds pretty cool to meet you guys. Too bad Im on the east coast :(
GameSack Out of everyone you guys listed.... Your the only ones I would want to talk too. Well that and Pat he seems like he would be cool to check out the flea market with (one of my favorite hobbies.) I wish I could go, maybe next year. Unless there is some sort of cool convention in FL then I would drive :)  Anyway I love your videos and please keep making them forever! better than whats on TVCable by leaps and bounds.
GameSack when are you guys coming to Chicago?
GameSack Hope you guys and everyone else at the convention have fun! I wish I was close to Texas, I would definitely go.
GameSack what year!!!!???!!??!?
GameSack Wish I could be at these things. Awesome you guys are finally doing one.
GameSack Ill be there! I cannot WAIT to meet you guys!! Ok ok ok, calm down, Josh... stop geeking out... lol
GameSack Would be cool if you could make it to PAX AUS. :)
GameSack Maybe Ill attend something like this next year, would be cool meeting Joe and Dave. Ill have to bring my cheap Luigi hat for Dave sign ha.
GameSack Seriously, you guys a just middleaged men who are over obsessed with video games......hell ya I subscribed!
GameSack Dont forget to bring your life jackets
GameSack Ah, hell yeah!! I definitely have to go now.
GameSack I actually live across from the Game Chasers (not to be creepy) so I will definitely be there. Never been to a gaming convention before.
GameSack What! I hope our idiots here dont scare you
GameSack You and Boogie are my favs!
GameSack live in Texas but wont be able to go to Arlington :(
GameSack Are there any good retro video game conventions around Ohio? Ive always wanted to go to one but never know where one is close by.
GameSack Bring me the state of Texas so I can join in.
GameSack Bring your own sacks.
GameSack I wish Columbus Ohio had something like gaming conventions. Most we have is Ohayocon
GameSack Sorry I cant attend! I live in the UK and My parents will be in Naples at that point in time
GameSack I wish I lived in Texas. Well glad to hear you got in a convention. Hopefully this will bring in more people to appreciate this great show you guys make. Btw will you be doing a live broadcast of the show?
GameSack Mannnn, a lot of my favorite youtubers included you guys, I so wish I could fly up the states. Good luck there!
GameSack Great, Make Video about it, It will be amazing!
GameSack Why update a dead game when halo 3 has more players than halo 4.Get back Halo 3 Double XP Weekend and the ORIGINAL GAMETYPES.
GameSack lame gametypes for action sack
GameSack Dont take off multi team!!!!!!
GameSack I didnt know the Neo Geo CD was developed as a costeffective alternative to the original Neo Geo system. I always just figured it was a response to the illconceived CD system boom of the early 90s, but I guess a costreduced version makes more sense for the Neo Geo.
GameSack Cool episode!:D Am I the only one that Twinkle Star Spritess mechanic and gameplay reminds of Touhou 3 Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream for the PC98?
GameSack Another awesome video as usual guys! I dont own the NeoGeoCD, but this video games me want to own one!
GameSack Neo geo the ultimate fighting console that every kid wanted but couldnt afford, so they rented it in a store. Or was i the only one
GameSack I Like the games on the system. but at the time it wsnt worth it to buy one. Not to many variations of games plus expensive console. Love metal slug played it on NeoGeo emulator great game. My favorite on the system
GameSack Another great episode. Nice work guys.
GameSack As I stated on their Facebook page a couple weeks ago, this is the only Youtube subscription I anticipate new videos on. For some reason I cant find my comment on their page anymore though....
GameSack That one with the knights would work great on the Wii... of course, then we have Dragon Quest Swords...
GameSack Its been a few days since I watched this episode so forgive me if I am wrong. But I dont recall one platformer for this... platform. Were there any platformers for this platform at all? If so did you feature any in other episodes?
GameSack Crossed Swords always made me think about the Phantasy Star game battles, imagining both of those mixed together would be damn amazing 00
GameSack Well, I have a Neo Geo, but I have never come across a Neo Geo CD...
GameSack Btw is that Iron Clad an actual copy or a bootleg? I mean that game goes for around 500 now and its just simply not that great of a game for its price.
GameSack This is a great review of the Neo Geo CD guys. You both crack me up with your sense of humor. I am glad I subscribed to your channel last year. It was some time before you guys did your Sharp X68000 review which was an awesome review that everyone should see. Very informative and very entertaining! Two things you guys are good that! :)
GameSack Shit the neogeo was a beast.
GameSack So jealous you have SVC Chaos on the AES. I just ordered it for the original XBOX today. Thats the real Capcom vs SNK that I think a lot of fans dont know exists. I dont understand why it hasnt been released digitally.
GameSack Neo Geo CD reminds me of a North American SEGA Saturn and the games and cases remind me of Japanese SEGA Saturn games. Both systems are obviously 2D juggernauts.
GameSack neo geo AES is the one and only for me.still got it and its still impressive. the sound and the graphics are sick. the music really sounds like cd. that is so impressive if you think about that the console came out in 1990. the console was like 8 years ahead of its time. i mean. even the saturn and the playstation couldnt emulate metal slug, last blade or samurai spiritsshodown perfectly. there are still some animations missing from backgrounds or charakters. and there where no loading time at all on the AES
GameSack Sweet Video guys, NEO GEO cd is the last console I want for my collection!
GameSack That was one hell of an episode! I own a Japanese Neo Geo CD but always wanted to get a CDZ. I hear that the system heats up quickly though and may lead to some hardware failure. Did you encounter such a thing while recording the footage for this awesome episode?
GameSack youve proven to me that you have more money than sense. lol, man.. how many people do we know that are exactly like that?great episode again.this show is so choice, I swear 3
GameSack I wonder if the ratio between the time I spend waiting for my NG:CD to load is comparable to the difference in money I would make working for that same amount of time, and spending the money on an MVS version of the same game instead. Perhaps, but Im too impatient to do the calculations P
GameSack Did Dave just bch slapped Joe? XD
GameSack Im going to watch the super popular puzzle games episode. It was super popular after all.
GameSack I always choose the offensive orgy. ALWAYS. HA Great episode guys!
GameSack Please do a episode on the Commodore 64. Such a great system!
GameSack Ive never been able to afford one of these, so I cheat and play the homebrew Sega Dreamcast ports, of which there are many. I dont think every game has been ported yet, but quite a few have and new ones are still released occasionally. Theyre not totally perfect ports as the sound can be kinda wonky at times (like, sometimes the music will drop out and then randomly start back up again a minute or two later), but theyre definitely a decent option for gamers on a budget if you know where to find them.
GameSack Last blade was made by the same guy who made guilty gear and founded Arc Systems
GameSack Had a Neo Geo CD that I had to sell on ebay before college, broke my heart. My collection consisted of Real Bout Fatal Fury 1,2 and special, KOFs 9498, and Samurai Showdowns 14. The load times are so long you become immune to load times in general... sigh, I dont know if Ill ever love again.
GameSack Awesome as usual, Ive got a CDZ without a PSU (which im just getting around to sorting out), looks like a nice system.
GameSack Dave... you flicking faggot.
GameSack Could you do a episode on bad licensed games. Theres plenty to choose from and I know you guys would show a game Ive never even heard of.
GameSack Your show is better than a lot of the game review videos out there. Some ideas for episodes and opinions.Bad voice acting in games.Show less Shooters.Coop 16 bit games.Left in Europe.Theres always been lots of talk about Mario and Sonic. Bonk for turbografx was the competing mascot. Could do a brief history on him.Be amusing to see you two switch roles. Joe acts like Dave and vice versa.
GameSack cant stop. watching. this channel. too much. awesome.
GameSack Cool, lots of info on a system I knew very little about aside from the Neo Geo connection and the loading times (and Im not surprised to learn that theyre exaggerated).
GameSack I think I didnt get one was because Im not a big fan of SNK fighting games. This thing was meant for fighting fans.
GameSack Good one! Ending was nice, but it gave me a more extreme idea for an ad: The Neo Geo CD  Finally homeless bums can enjoy the 24bit power! :)
GameSack Wow, wow... No Art Of Fighting?! There are some of the 3 best games in the system, plus the third one has animations in the level od Street Fighter 3...! I missed the King of Fighters series and also some nice sports games, like Super Sidekicks, Windjammers and that golf game, Neo Turf Masters, but you guys already covered this one.Nice vdeo, I love the Neo Geo CD, the games are very collectible, nice artworks in the manuals and cds. Treasures!
GameSack Review kid chameleon for Sega gen
GameSack Also guys was the ending sequence a shot a the elitist attitude that most of the collectors show? Lol man they must be pissed lol!
GameSack You guys are awesome. I really look forward to these reviews each week. So much effort and passion is incorporated into each episode. Great job!
GameSack The best vids on Youtube!!
GameSack Awesome episode guys! I own a Neo Geo CD but I really wish I owned a regular Neo Geo. The load times are horrendous on my model!
GameSack They are a lot of neo geo AESMVS games that did not get a release on CD)Any way to take neo geo AESAES rom and burn it to a cd so you could play them on neo geo cd?
GameSack They are a lot of neo geo AESMVS games that did not get a release on CD)Any way to take neo geo AESAES rom and burn it to a cd so you could play them on neo geo cd?
GameSack Id like to own a neo cd at some point, ive got AES and MVS in a candy cabinet. Prices are indeed out of reach for the most people on AES, but MVS is clearly the best option (just needs a supergun to be usable outside a cab). CDs just dont feel right for neo games, but then again its just my opinion. Still, a good addition to someones collection, its SNK hardware after all !
GameSack sweet Golden Axe shirt Dave!
GameSack Even though the cd is cheaper, is funny that the music is better in some games.
GameSack I love the time these guys put into their videos, its what separates them from a lot of the other reviewers.
GameSack Appreciate the laughs and for that game I will give you a 6.710 dollhairs
GameSack Are there any Fighting Games on the Neo Geo CD?
GameSack OMG a Night Trap T shirt! drool
GameSack So of all the comedy skits at the end of all the episodes... this one so far is definately my favourite!!!!!
GameSack Amazing episode ! You guys are the best ! Keep doing the amazing work! I almost bought the 1x cd read version back in 1995 here in Brazil, but I ended buying the Sega Saturn and didnt regret, as the Sega console also had lots of SNKs classics. And the loading times on the 1x cd rom version are really really annoying...
GameSack Dave and Joe both wearing Sega shirts... what is this world coming to?
GameSack Nice episode. To restart a game hold down all four buttons and startselect, it will take you back to the CD Audio menu.
GameSack Awesome. I love these Neo Geo episodes. Keep up the great work guys!
GameSack You were able to point out the loading times on Last Blade in quite an amusing way.The skit at the end was priceless as well. Hope to see more, as with the X68000 comp as well!
GameSack Broadcast quality show here!
GameSack Great show guys! You should do a sketchonly special you guys are hilarious!
GameSack One system that I hope you cover in the future is the MSX I havent played it but I heard that it has a lot of great games that never came out on any other systems, especially by Konami.
GameSack Is that a real Turf masters? If so that is quite amazing!
GameSack How often do episodes of gamesack come out, I started to miss u guys so I started watching older episodes... Again, huge fan of gamesack here!
GameSack Great episode guys! but I was surprised that KOF (King of Fighters) was not reviewed! was hoping or that game to show up. still I enjoyed the Episode :)
GameSack Wow, their acting actually improved. I remember playing Samurai Spirits 2 at a supermarket while my parents were shopping. And also when the store simply pulled it away because of the increasing number of children going there only to play for free.
GameSack You guys have the best shirts. Always look forward to see what you guys wear for the review. Thanks for all that you guys do.
GameSack Great episode as always.
GameSack Nice episode, but according to the wikipedia page the CDZ still had a 1x cd rom drive. It had an expanded cache for faster load times.http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiNeoGeoCD
GameSack Come on dudes, Viewpoint is SO cool!
GameSack 1000s of dollars my ass i got aes neogeo n all my games i for for like 4050 bujks a cartridge bak in day at game crazy in hollywood video and every time i go to retro expos in seattle i find most caerridges for like 100 buks so u saying 1000 dollars is pure bs n here say lol
GameSack Greetings from Boulder. Your stopmotion hardware teardowns are the best.
GameSack ABCSelect  return to CD playerABCStart  reset the softwaretadah!I love GS videos but too bad no AES vs CD in this video
GameSack Another obscure system  another great episode! A bit fighter heavy, but hey, Neo Geo  what can you do? :)Ive picked up several of the Neo Geo compilations and Dreamcast ports released over the years, but I still have many Neo Geo games on my wish list. I figure either the CD or consolized MVS is my best option if I ever decide to go with original hardware.Had never seen Twinkle Star Sprites before  looks like an amazing puzzleshooter hybrid. Thanks for the recommendation, Dave!
GameSack I love Samurai Shodown 4. I used to play it so much in the arcade. The first time when I beat it I felt like I was gonna crap myself because it was the first game I ever beat, also I was about 7 and I used an exploit on the last boss to beat him.. yea I wasnt really that good. :P
GameSack You guys still impress me with youre high quality production YouTube videos. I didnt know there was a Neo Geo CD console. Keep up the good work.
GameSack Savage Reign looks insane, looked it up and it is on the Fun Super Combo Ps2 game released in Japan, so I actually have a chance to play it! Thanks Game Sack!
GameSack Why would you rip video game music? I cant see the point. Seems a waste of time.
GameSack You guys are great yall need to do more episodes.
GameSack Man, I always love those postcredit gags.
GameSack Where did you get the shirt Dave?
GameSack i dont know...the neo geo neer really appealed to and after this i still say no the neo geo cd, honestly i am not a fan early to mid nineties cd based consuls...it is a good effort but the quality of the cds and (graphics arent eer thing) the loading times, I mean i just want to sit and play. what I do not like about the neo geo cd looks like well, it is a fighting arcade and i do not like that, aside from that all other games were either games that are a ripped off of other games to games that are already on other systems than and now. With that said this was another great episode and although it turned me away from the system and games it was still fun worth watching. Thank you guys and remember this is my thought and opinion so please do not hate
GameSack 29:40 I got a story. Ahem! Today...I will tell you the story of the ThousandYearloading endsOh hey! The games ready!
GameSack dude...the guy on the left is like a weird hybrid of ron perlman and jim gaffigan loloh you...you irishbad ass video nonetheless, dat golden axe shirt!
GameSack Mr. Dave, you were right, sweet game, and imo a sweet shirt. Shirtwin is a tie, that Night Trap shirt is pretty awesome too :) I cant believe that Neo Geo cartridges were so damn expensive, thats unreal. I knew they were expensive, but damn. Metal Slug is the greatest run n gun series in history dammit. I love the SNK stuff, its almost all arcade game goodness, which I love. Any plans on doing more arcade game episodes? Great job as always guys, thanks for the goodness, and damn those after credit bits are entertaining :)
GameSack Id like to own a neo cd at some point, ive got AES and MVS in a candy cabinet. Prices are indeed out of reach for the most people on AES, but MVS is clearly the best option (just needs a supergun to be usable outside a cab). CDs just dont feel right for neo games, but then again its just my opinion. Still, a good addition to someones collection, its SNK hardware after all !
GameSack Lol. Ok, did you remove the first digit of your super popular puzzle video views? Call me a nerd, but I pulled it up and its got 14 thousand views. Sure, thats 14k views in two years versus the 15k views in 17 hours this one has gotten, but thats nothing to scoff at, guys.
GameSack Was I the only one excited to see that they uploaded a new video?
GameSack sweet Golden Axe shirt Dave!
GameSack Are there any Fighting Games on the Neo Geo CD?
GameSack The neo geo cd has a reset just hold the four buttons and select.
GameSack So of all the comedy skits at the end of all the episodes... this one so far is definately my favourite!!!!!
GameSack Amazing episode ! You guys are the best ! Keep doing the amazing work!

GameSack Why dont these dudes have more subscribers??
GameSack Cant say I would ever buy one, but very cool nonetheless.
GameSack That slap at the end sounded like it hurt
GameSack Is that a real Turf masters? If so that is quite amazing!

GameSack One of the best gaming channels on YouTube...they should have way more subscribers.
GameSack You guys still impress me with youre high quality production YouTube videos. I didnt know there was a Neo Geo CD console. Keep up the good work.
GameSack Savage Reign looks insane, looked it up and it is on the Fun Super Combo Ps2 game released in Japan, so I actually have a chance to play it! Thanks Game Sack!
GameSack You guys are great yall need to do more episodes.
GameSack Man, I always love those postcredit gags.
GameSack Do you guys have Windjammers Flying Power Disc for the CD or AES? Id love to hear you talk about it.
GameSack KOF for another episode? SCHWEET! Its sad that its the only ongoing SNK series, though....
GameSack Love the stopmotion effects. You guys are awesome! Please keep bringing us these interesting looks into past consoles!
GameSack Golden axe shirt rocks. Arent you a Nintendo fan or did you have a change of heart in an episode I havent seen yet ?
GameSack Where did you get the shirt Dave?
GameSack i dont know...the neo geo neer really appealed to and after this i still say no the neo geo cd, honestly i am not a fan early to mid nineties cd based consuls...it is a good effort but the quality of the cds and (graphics arent eer thing) the loading times, I mean i just want to sit and play. what I do not like about the neo geo cd looks like well, it is a fighting arcade and i do not like that, aside from that all other games were either games that are a ripped off of other games to games that are already on other systems than and now.

GameSack This game is completely messed up! I would hate to be that guy (getting hit in the balls)
GameSack She said neeej nej nej, not naaa naa naa (batman)
GameSack Guys need to stop being girl characters, it gives me the chills... D:
GameSack Pahahahaha Paul mate this video is class. Best one uve edited in ages. Enjoyed being a part of the making it and being the evil old witch...but yeah class clips there. Oh and I realise my phone mic sucks so badly...Cldnt stop laughing the whole way through, keep em coming.
GameSack Funny video, was laughing the whole time. Can you upload more videos like this?
GameSack get loot get it get ship do again xD
GameSack Justice whats your amour called in your youtube picture ? The third age looking armour :P
GameSack I know that this does not relate to the episode but I just got today kid Dracula and damn is it tough
GameSack Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten at 5:15
GameSack Is the Game Sack a ScotteVest bag?
GameSack I expected many good games back then. Some of these games would actually do well in sales. It seems they felt discouraged about how well it would go.
GameSack Have you played, heard, or seen anything from the Densha De Go series?
GameSack VERY TENNISY HUH? hahah another great episode.
GameSack Almost 50k subscribers, and very well deserved. Congratulations gentlemen!
GameSack 12:42 II thought it said DERPY and got really excited...
GameSack Really good episodecheers from brazil!
GameSack What are those switches on the side of your Saturn for, Dave? Also, Id would love to see Bahamut Lagoon covered in a future episode of LiJ.
GameSack well i guess in the usa no one pees, i think thats because in usa men doesnt have pennis mmm.. now i get it...
GameSack Talk about mother on the famicom!!!
GameSack Too many boring shoot em ups zzzz
GameSack Parodius Forever With Me is a great game! I like all games in the series! Hope to see them in your episodes!
GameSack if you guys plan on doing another left in japan, may i suggest seiken densetsu 3 on the SNES, the sequel to secret of mana? it improves pretty much everything (in my opinion anyway), from game play, character development, and the story is much grander. the only things that hinder it are a lack of customisation, because each character can only equip 1 type of weapon, and there are a couple of glitches that make certain items useless (im looking at you shields), and critical hits are nowhere to be seen. but still, if you liked secret of mana, you will almost surely like (or prefer if your really into it) Seiken Densetsu 3.
GameSack I remember playing that Lupin the 3rd game when I was a kid. It must have been a bootleg copy.
GameSack (Original post: Was my post deleted?)Sorry, it was gone... I even clicked all comments, expanded the whole page and CtrlFsearched for just my name, and could not find it. I have put thousands of hours into my retexture projects and gotten nothing in return so my frustration level can climb easily.GTG and thanks,Jay
GameSack I somehow missed this one when it came out a week ago!
GameSack One game that never left Japan which I would love to see you guys talk about is Legend of Legaia 2. The first one was a super amazing game (which sadly not many people have heard of that I know) and it really sucks that we never got to see the sequal.
GameSack You should make an episode about games with balls in them like Super Monkey Ball, Marble Madness etc. and call the episode Ball sack instead of Game sack.
GameSack adventures of little Ralph, for PSX
GameSack Magical Popn, the main character looks like Blue Link.
GameSack You guys have the most consistent show on the internet. Ive been enjoying it for a long time. Now if only I could get me some of these Japanese games!
GameSack you guys should dedicate an episode to cave shooters :) lots of great region free japanese imports on the xbox 360 :) cave shooters are the best :) also 5pb made a really good region free shooter called bullet soul :)
GameSack The main character in the Agedama game looks kind of like Keith Courage. In fact, this game could probably be the sequel that the credits talked about!
GameSack subscribed. and great vid
GameSack Rudra no Hihou The Treasure of Rudra, one of Squaresofts obscure jewels from the last years of the Super Famicom (thus the probable reason It didnt make It to America as the N64 was just launched to sale for that time). I would also mention Pulseman but he came to America in 2009 via Wiis virtual console so, dunno if It counts:
GameSack Hey would be cool to see some games that got changed when they came to America. I imagine you guys know more examples, but there are the superficial examples like M.BisonBalrogVega in Street Fighter, however I just found out about how they changed a Ranma 12 game to Street Combat (SNES) when it came out in America.
GameSack Just subbed. Gonna help you hit 15k!
GameSack guys you should make an entire episode dedicated to MSX! that if you have one of course :)
GameSack Thanks so much for this! I never heard of Magical Popn but its super cool! :)
GameSack I like Daves hair because its like mine
GameSack Awesome as usual. Thanks guys.
GameSack These make me jealous sometimes that Japan gets so many inventive titles that dont make it out to the states. We never get to see bugs pissing rivers!Also, but kind of unrelated, doing some video reviews has revealed some interesting things about narration, like the importance of carefully pronouncing certain phrases like game mechanics (I bet you guys know what I mean!)...What do you guys think of my Legaia 2 review?Experiential Game Reviews: Legaia 2: Duel Saga
GameSack Imagine zero gunner 2 and bangaio if dreamcast came with twin sticks..
GameSack Super Tempo  Tryrush Deppy in ONE Episode!!NICE!!  (Both REALLY Rare and expensive...)
GameSack Also Why did you guys choose games not really most people would even know of I mean like I appreciate you guys trying to find some diverse games but like mother 3, pokemon typing maybe some more well known Japan exclusive series
GameSack Great episode as always, I have played all of these games. JK ), I have played about 5 of them total I think. Magical Popn is definitely my favorite from this list, epic game.
GameSack Keep doing what you do guys. I love your videos and are easily the best gaming gurus on youtube.
GameSack Despite your admitted poor knowledge of the Japanese language I think its great that you at least put some effort into pronouncing the original names of the games properly and show some respect for the culture jokes aside.
GameSack I wonder if the Japanese ever make videos and write blogs about games being translated and released from the US market to Japan. I wonder if they even care.
GameSack Tobal No. 2 on the Play Station X or one. its a really good Fighter and there is a Eng Patch for this game.
GameSack Favorite video game reviewers on youtube! Thanks guys.
GameSack Cant remember if you guys coverd the best JAPOnly game of them all yet. Adventure of little Ralph for PSXPS1 :)One word, Awesome!
GameSack You guys have some really good content. I also really enjoy your style of presentation. Keep it up Im mostly going through your back catalog of videos.
GameSack Dave White looks like a younger Eddie Fitzgerald.
GameSack Question: what setup do you use for recording Sega Saturn footage?
GameSack Try the soccer RPG game Captain Tsubasa on Famicom  super famicom. I love the game. Try part 2 or 3.
GameSack Great channel guys since discorving it a few days ago, ive been addicted! Top stuff! thanks for the hard work!
GameSack Another entertaining episode that showed me a bunch of coollooking games Id never heard of. Id love to see my alltime favorite import, Blue Seed for the Sega Saturn, covered on one of these (assuming it wasnt covered in Left in Japan 1 or 2, since I havent gotten around to watching those yet).
GameSack That macross game was rereleased for the ps3 and came bundled with the bluray version of the same movie it was based on.
GameSack Great left in Japan games...Phantasy Star (Mega Drive convert... just for the nostalgia)Thunder Force V (Saturn)Strider (Mega Drive version they cut the huh with the sword strike and ALL SONS OF OLD GODS... DIE!!!!)Perhaps and episode that highlights the differences between US and Japanese versions of great games. Some of the changes make NO sense to me.
GameSack Nice work on showing the PC Engine some more attention. For the next Left episode you can do even more PCE stuff. Lots of great games on that platform. From hucards to super cd to arcade card cd games like ports of neo geo games.
GameSack definitely too much shooters in this series... please get more crazy japanese titles :)
GameSack While I think it could be its own episode, Id love to see Segagaga.
GameSack Another classic video! I keep on discovering new stuff thanks to you both!
GameSack Legend of Xanadu II looks awesome. Too bad it was never localized for NA.
GameSack Hey Joe and Dave.....love the series....Im an retro gamer myself....and mostly into imports...You guys arent big wrestling fanatics....maybe left in japan 7 or 8 can be dedicated to the games like funaki hybrid wrestler, stardust suplex or even the fabled firepro wrestling series....I mean there are schittloads out there....you can do a show on firepro wrestling itself.....if you guys need a list....happy to help....
GameSack I like Magical Flying Hat Turbo Adventure (MegaDrive)Psycho Fox (Master System, saw it also in the Master System episode, love this game)Wondering, if you will make an episode about the Sailor Moon fighting games, didnt saw it in the fighting game episodeAnd I missed the smurfs  Die Schlmpfe and Asterix (Asterix and Obelix) for Master System and MegaDrive in the mascots episode or with good or bad sequelsThey also didnt appear in the Western developed games episodes.I know, you cant talk about all games out there. So maybe we see some games from that in the future episodes. I am looking forward for that. Love your show. Great. Keep it doing.Thanks.
GameSack To answer your question on Xanadu II, yes, an English patch is in the works, and yes, the cutscenes are being translated to. Im actually one of the voice actors in the project. Sadly, I think the project hit a brick wall a few years ago, and I havent heard from the project head since then. :
GameSack Hey, I cared about the Sports episode, I enjoy every episode! I actually hope you guys make a 2nd sports one someday. Anyway, great episode, I really liked that outro bit, that one may have been one of my favorites so far.
GameSack Great episode. Needs more Koei.
GameSack More like Try Rush  DERPY!! OooooooOoOooOOooo.... sick burn. :P
GameSack I feel like Radical Dreamers should be on this series eventually. Not so heavy on gameplay, but damn the english translation is fantastic
GameSack For Left in Japan 6, Transformers for Famicom? Ill be impressed if you guys can make it past the first level.
GameSack You could probably do an entire episode on The Great Battle series released on the Famicom,SFC,Gameboy,PS1,NDS  PSP. There are also a ton of spinoff titles too, and theyre all pretty sweet!
GameSack Another great show. Tempo 2 looks pretty cool
GameSack hell yeah parodius!! DO IT!! )
GameSack The song that plays over the credits, is that from Granada? Where can I find that arrangement? Thanks!
GameSack Yu yu hakusho final only n japan 4 super famicom js
GameSack Zanac for the PS1! No one talks abou this game. :(We only got the NES version here in North America.
GameSack here is an idea game sack...you can roll with or eh, the idea. Home brew video games, hacks, part 2 with a twist, throw some creepy pastas in there. Here are few creepy pastas, dead sonic, tails doll from sonic racing whom makes people who pla as tails doll commit suicide, pokemon lavender town, white hand, lavender town music and more. I really liked that home brew episode so i threw that idea in there. Aright Dave and Joe
GameSack 14:00 is just like in real life.
GameSack wow you really did blast that girls top off. Thanks for putting these games on my radar.
GameSack You guys should check out a Japanonly PSX game called Community Pom. I think itd be right up your alley.
GameSack Can anyone recommend more RPGs with camera angle as on 1:03 that are in English or at least English subtitles.
GameSack The only problem with the series are the hosts. I think they are into a different type of sack from a game one.
GameSack have you played bara yarou gourmet sentai on the famicom? the graphics are excellent and its a funny surreal cyber punk japan as fuck take on the side scrolling beat em up.you get to make a recipe with all the strange food you tend to find usually for energy in that style of game at the end of each level hehe.
GameSack You forgot every single other game that you didnt mention here. Im telling my mommy on you.
GameSack Thanks for hanging lampshades on you pronunciation fails.
GameSack Frey looks adorable. Those graphics on Super Tempo are fucking awesome. Poppin seems like a girl Link.
GameSack Be sure to like this video up! Lets get 500 Likes, like only if you enjoyed though! I will be blown away.
GameSack I hate bunjie now they dont seem to give a shit that they just abandoned halo their masterpiece , to turn to shit and they just go make Destiny which just looks like boarderlands (but more serious)
GameSack What I dont understand is how bungie feels that it understands the playstation community, and I dont think the Playstation community understands them either. The vast majority of Bungies fans are based on the xbox, and the remainder of them on PC, owning to Halo and bungies previous titles like myth. Theyve never made a game for them, and also the majority of playstation users will never have played Halo. So hundreds of thousands of Playstation players have preordered the game based solely on the fact that it was praised by critics at E3, and also that the development studio has made very popular games (Halo) in the past, that (vitally) they themselves actually havent had the opportunity to play. Who knows what they might be expecting, especially with all the hype? Most of them arent preordering the game because of their own experience with Bungies games, and that will cause some of the players to be dissapointed. All im saying is that a lot of them dont really know what to expect (gameplay wise) from Destiny, or from Bungie themselves. They might have all hyped themselves up for a game that just isnt their bag of chips, and that would be a shame for the reviews and the reputation of Bungie.I didnt mean this comment to be hateful in any way, and am just concerned about how quickly the community size on that platform may decline. Id like to hear anyone elses opinions on this.
GameSack Whens the beta again?
GameSack When they say about the cities not being of our own creation, could they not be referring to Humanity? As in these cities are made by the enemies in destiny.
GameSack Who preorderd the beta!
GameSack I havent missed a bungie beta yet and my code I think I sent it to a wrong email cause I dont see any notification or email that I will be able to play the beta Im kinda losing my shit
GameSack Wtf is up with these names.? Lmao lol
GameSack do we keep what we earned in the beta or do we get something because we contributed by playing the beta

GameSack I thought this was YouTube, not YouPorn?!?!Great video guys, very funny! The PlayStations cum face was a little off putting though, hehehe

GameSack Just imagine what would happened if they added a Sony PS Move controller to that party
GameSack console sex YEAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
GameSack Those sound effects are so stock, I feel like Im watching a promotion video for some source site.
GameSack i thought the snes played hard to get, then turned down the playstation?
GameSack Dude please explain? I watched this last night when you released this video and than you deleted it? I tried to refresh the page to post a comment and it said video deleted ?
GameSack cant wait for the beta!
GameSack so youhave other two other chanells and you choose to like your videos to get more views your so dumb be a independent youtuber for once
GameSack 1:50 Heyy! Didnt know that the MajesticSix from Crysis 2 and 3 was in this game! Seems all big revolvers look the same these days...
GameSack How do you get into the BETA ?
GameSack damnonly if PC had destiny RIP PC gaming
GameSack All things holy considered? The Binding of Isaac.
GameSack Nice run! By the way, toward the end of the video, the gameplay audio got way out of sync.
GameSack NO Original Medal of Honor!? Fail! )
GameSack Best console ever, hands down.
GameSack I totally had to turn my Ps1 upside down haha. i had 3 ps1s in the 1st year i owned one. luck of the draw. Great console!
GameSack abes odyssey is one of my favorite games of ALL FUCKING TIME MOTHERFUCKER.this game blew my mind and still does... cant wait for the remake!
GameSack you know what game IS MUCH MORE fun than vandal hearts? front mission 3...
GameSack Can someone please give me some pointers. I want to start making videos and doing my own walkthroughs on youtube. Unfortunately idk enough about the copyright issues where if you do a walkthrough of a game it can be removed by the publisher. I heard its only for newer games but a few have said that games of last gen(ps3360) you can still have your videos removed from doing those too. Would it be best if i just stuck to doing Retro games(Thats kinda what i want to do though)? i heard HDpvrs are an awful choice when trying to record games through an Svideo output? That they were designed only for HD Gaming? If i want to record a ps1 or 2 games from my ps3 will it show the game correctly or will it drop in frames. SorrY if these are dumb questions but i must know!
GameSack The best console ever after the PS2.
GameSack I really liked Rage Racer back in the day. Surprised me.
GameSack Damn nooo final fantasy vii!
GameSack Crash 3 Warped is definitely the best game in the series.
GameSack I would have to throw in the Mega Man Legend franchise for the PSX. Great games.
GameSack Good video! Brings back the memories. Playstation started so many series. My favorite are Final Fantasy 7, Gran Turismo, Tekken, Twisted Metal.. and others I forgot
GameSack 2:07 hhahah I did notice that if I keep my playstation like that or standing up like new consoles it worked better, I didnt have any idea why it just worked, but now I know it was over heating.
GameSack NO resident evil? pssh.
GameSack The first Playstation is my favourite console up till today. You can just have unlimited fun with the many awesome old titles that its incredible. To mention few which werent mentioned: Rayman, Akuji, Gex, Legend of Kartia (never heard anybody talkin bout it), DoDonpachi (my fav shmup), Discworld, Fear Effect 2, Medievil... way too many to count.
GameSack Ive never even heard of having to turn the playstation upside down. I never had any cooling problem I guess.
GameSack Ah, Playstation! This was the first console I ever bought (previously Id had an Amiga and an Acorn Electron .. and my G7000 was bought by my dad).It cemented my love of games forever! Tekken2, Wipeout2097, Tobal No.1, Silent Hill, Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil, FF VIIVIIIIX, Vagrants Story, SOTN, Rollcage, MK 3, Warhawk, Tony Hawks Pro Skater, The Midway and Namco arcade classics, to name but a few of my fave games.Had every Sony console since!
GameSack they overlap but the PS1 was the first of the new generation and the DC was the last of the old generation. sony changed everything when they got involved and sega changed everything when they dropped out.
GameSack this was a pleasure to watch thanksbut i was hoping to see jet moto or twisted metal on here im sure you guys played both those games and you guys probably spit balled including one of them
GameSack One of my favorite PS1 games is SpiderMan by Activision. I was a huge fan of the animated series at the time and I thought it was great that they retained a lot of the shows cast to voice their characters in the game, especially Efrem Zimbalist as Doc Ock. The narration by Stan Lee is also great and adds a certain charm that other SpiderMan games lack. The story and gameplay are both awesome and I played through it countless times in the year or so after it first came out. To this day, its still the SpiderMan game by which I judge all others.Also, in the same way that Final Fantasy 7 was the first RPG for a lot of people, Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete was my first and even now is one of the only ones that held my interest long enough to get to the end. Eternal Blue Complete was also amazing, but I like the first game a little bit more.Other favorites of mine are Rayman 2: The Great Escape, PacMan World, Tomba!, Gundam Battle Assault, Resident Evil 2 and Spyro: Year Of The Dragon.
GameSack do the ps2 or original xbox
GameSack I gladly retired my Original PS console upon buying my PS2 Fat console model.Besides playing these games today without the PS2 Texture Smoothing feature turned on is a nono in my book.
GameSack On RIDGE RACER and RR REVOLUTION, you will UNLOCK the extra cars with a PERFECT score on the Galaxian or Galaga 88 intros!RIDGE RACER REVOLUTION allows you to race on ALL tracks from both Rigde Racer and the RR Revolution in the SYSTEM LINK mode! R4 is the only other Ridge Racer game with a system link. Linked racing is sweet and cheap to make happen on the PSX these days. 2 PSXs with link cable (10 online) and 2 SD Tubes!
GameSack Alucard  Dracula backwards
GameSack Mudo cons?....... Did you even play the game?
GameSack Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time was my favorite game on this console. The vintage Looney Tunes humor mixed into different time periods made the experience worth it.
GameSack God the PS1 is such a kickass system! So many great games
GameSack You should cover games and series like Jet Moto, Resident Evil, Road Rash, Tekken, Tomb Raider, Twisted Metal, Vigilante 8, Wipeout, and Um Jammer Lammy.
GameSack Do some of you people even watch the video before you comment???
GameSack D: how the hell did you forget bloody roar
GameSack Harry and the original cheryl ftw
GameSack The playstation was definitely much better as a 2D console. I missed out on a lot good games by going the Nintendo 64 route. I dont regret it though.
GameSack i wish i saved all the copies of official playstation mag i had, literally hundreds of demo discs one for each issue
GameSack Great list and thanks for adding Kula World, Poy Poy  TombaTombi
GameSack Silent hill was my favourite game ever :) very good game
GameSack I cant believe I didnt play some of these as a kid. They look great.
GameSack uhh.... no mention of resident evil, gran turismo (like... THE best racing game on the whole system)?
GameSack GAME SACK, Y U NO INCLUDE WIPEOUT!? THAT WAS PSYGNOSIS REAL GEM ON THE PLAYSTATION!
GameSack I actually played Total Eclipse Turbo today :o creppy
GameSack you can make the screen follow spyro you know its a setting in the game all three for the playstation have that
GameSack good list of games and I would for sure love to try silent hill on PS1 cause I own one myself
GameSack who hates the metroidvania games? i will destroy them!!!!!!!!
GameSack Im surprised nobody mentioned spyro the dragon.
GameSack I loved both Vandal Hearts and Final Fantasy Tactics. So much time wasted between the two. Great games!
GameSack its adventurerpg hybrid alundra theese guys really dont there genres or games there biost against final fantasy resident evil n silent hill n parasie eve seris i hate biost reviewrs there so biost its like watchin xplay again lol
GameSack No mention of the Colony Wars or GPolice series?
GameSack rayman, rayman 2, the coolboarders series and pacman 3d were some of my favourite games as a kid that werent already mentioned
GameSack Ape Escape had to be the best PS1 game
GameSack You should both kill your self and try get a life
GameSack playstation easily has the best controllers.
GameSack no Crash Bandicoot? that was fun game
GameSack Hidden gem for RidgeRacer 1 once the game loaded,pop,out,the CD then,put your own,music disk in,the game ...,now Race on,
GameSack Vandal hearts was awesome.
GameSack I just stood it on its side
GameSack CLASSIC GAME ROOM talked about GHOST IN THE SHELL a few years back.
GameSack Make a review on the Nintendo entertainment system game sack
GameSack you forgot them working with Philips sony backed out of the deal with Philips but Philips ended up releasing a system anyway even the it sucked badly
GameSack you guys should review the original Xbox
GameSack Thumbs up if you agree the PS1 is better than the N64!
GameSack My favorite PS game ??? N20: Nitrous Oxide !!!!
GameSack The underside of the CDs were clearly not black to prevent piracy. I remember the Action Replay chip that slid into the Parallel I0 slot on the right side of the Playstation on the back that would enable you to play copiedburnt Playstation games. Was pretty cool along with it acting as a Gameshark at the same time
GameSack I got an erection in the last part, is that normal?
GameSack ALICARD? Just....why?
GameSack I really hope to see more console focused videos from you guys. The others are definitely good but the main reason i got kind of obsessed with this channel is because of the Dreamcast and Saturn episodes.
GameSack Hello Game Sack, You should play Ridge Racer always in cocpit perspective. Its easier to get the drifts in controll. The drifting in the first Ridge Racers is simply the best and later episodes didnt preserve that pretty well.
GameSack My favorite game on PS1 is Bushido Blade 2. I and my friend used to play that game for hours.
GameSack y u no mention Metal Gear Solid?
GameSack The PS1 was cool in its time, but I just cant bring myself to go back and play that generation of games. 8 and 16 bit I still play from time to time, but the 32 bit games suffered hard from that awkward shift from 2d to 3d where they just didnt have things figured out yet, and the controls, and other game play mechanics suffered because of it.
GameSack Did they really have to review Metal Gear Solid?
GameSack tenchu? wheres tenchu!!!
GameSack My eyes are offended by the hosts
GameSack Parrappa is the worst game ever, besides is extremely stupid. (I dont care if i spelled the name wrong)
GameSack I had a crush on the Japanese girl from Ridge Racer
GameSack Time Crisis is way better than Virtua Cop
GameSack ohh my god did the playstation and a lower class nintendo system just have sex
GameSack How would you know to turn you Playstation upside down with out internet?
GameSack Tobal 1 was a very fun fighting game. The characters were designed by Akira Toriyama. Plus a Final Fantasy 7 Sample disc was included.
GameSack If it werent for crash bandicoot Idk how I wouldve made it through that first year of middle school.
GameSack 99 of the time I go back to old games, I am disappointed. They rarely hold up. A friend of mine played Crash Bandicoot again and was horrified. Well, yeah. The truth, of course, is that the craft advances. Rose tinted glasses notwithstanding. That said, remembering them is a lot of fun!
GameSack Its weird that when Im a grandparent this thing will seem to super ancient to my grandchildren just like Atari seems old to me
GameSack My favorite games are for the PlayStationMedal of HonorGame of LifeMetal Gear SolidGTA 2DriverTomb RaiderGran Turismo 2Tiger Woods PGA Tour GolfWipeoutGexPizza Hut Demo Disks
GameSack ach dhalu pls aboniren
GameSack Holly hat als erste das Band des Teams gebrochen :D
GameSack Hat du bogg mit mir viedo zu machen
GameSack Wenn ich diese verkakte jim fotzenkopf werbung noch einmal sehen muss raste ich aus...skfkjwbefinejfbvwulvbhijbiw .
GameSack You forgot gex the gecko. Gex was orginially a mascot for the company crystal dynamics. Sadly though crystal dynamics only shits out tomb raider nowadays.
GameSack The word you were looking for at the end of the Socket portion was labyrinthine.
GameSack I like to imagine that the very last part of this video wasnt a scripted joke, and that the guy on the right is genuinely traumatised and didnt see that coming.Also, Scud is reeeeal mharti! Oh no, hes reeeal!
GameSack I know you said about people talking about mascots you didnt include, but can I thank you for NOT including Bubsy the Bobcat on the list, everytime someone talks about mascots they ALWAYS bring him up. So thank you ever so much for not mentioning him :D
GameSack Man I love Vector Man! I think it failed becuase at was launched at the on consoles lifecycle. But I like the music and graphics. I dont mind for the poligonal design, actually vector man got in top ten s favorites for Sonic Transformed petitions! And well, I dont know how much success got Captain Commando in US, but everyone liked it in Costa Rica! I actually know other latinamerican fellas tat like it... But still, you guys are right, both are failed mascots
GameSack Ugh. Voice is so monotone and unexpressive, but great video anyway. You introduced me to a lot of mascots I missed out on!
GameSack i had bought chibi robo for the 3DS and HATED IT
GameSack That skunk mascot sounds like he was made by some random Chinese video game producer.
GameSack At least each of these Sonic wannabes seemed different as opposed to now where every new game character is the same scruffy, unshaven white guy wandering through some ruined city. Who was the last new original platforming star who had a colorful world? Sackboy?
GameSack BUBSY!!!! BUBSY!!!!I like your Snatcher shirt btw
GameSack Vectorman was a VERY good game , you old fat bastards are high.
GameSack Loved Croc myself back in the days.Never played any of the others though, a store near me sells Billy Hatcher though.Maybe I should spend some money on it.
GameSack 1) all living things generate CO22) while running on electricity doesnt mean that the device necessarily produces carbon, that electricity has to come from somewhere, and the most efficient way to do that involves creating carbon by burning things.
GameSack Great video! Been enjoying old forgotten titles lately. Just a tidbit of info on ChibiRobo I have actually never played it but if anyone thought it looked interesting I want to point out that I read that at FIRST the game is merely doing chores... But eventually something (no spoilers) happens that forces Chibi to set up traps and avoid ones set up for him while still obeying his program ans cleaning things up. If you enjoyed the first Pikmin I have a hunch ChibiRobo might be just the game someone wanted! Plus its cheap on ebay usually! This video convinced me to subscribe! I love the narration.
GameSack buck bumble was the shit as a kid and so was vectorman. ive gone back to play the latter and still enjoyed it but i can see how they might not have stood the test of time.
GameSack The guy on the left looks exactly like an older ketroc
GameSack Did these clowns honestly just say sonic wasntshouldnt have been a staple mascot? Theyll let anyone have a YouTube channel these days.
GameSack a friend sold me a Croc for GBC back in the day, but I dont remember which one, it was decent.
GameSack PUNKY IS ADORABLE YOU CURR!!!
GameSack Crash Bandicoot  Spyro the Dragon.And who could forget Original the Character?
GameSack Id love to see you guys tackle on the modern mascots.
GameSack The logic that every platformer was trying to be a system mascot is so moronic it hurts my head, also all credibilty was lost when you trashed vectorman 1 2, amazing games featured in nearly every best of genesis lists.
GameSack You didnt mention Claw :)
GameSack Vectorman is AWESOME )I love the atmospere of the game, the gameplay, everything!I think that this mascot failed just because the 16 bit era came in the past. I live in Russia, everything was different here because we had everything much later, so these two games were extremelly popular here, and the Vectorman himself was very famous at the time
GameSack Gave you guys a shot but it didnt really hold me. I liked your ad anyway! Perhaps another time.
GameSack WHY DO U HAT DA 3DO, GEX IS ON IT.
GameSack I played Vectorman on Sonics Ultimate Genesis Collection on PS3.
GameSack Vector mans design was just a placeholder at first but then they decided that they liked him or something of that such.
GameSack How could you forget the worst mascot of all...Bubsy. He was HORRIBLE. Instead of being cool he came off like a prick. I believe the company who designed them bankrupted themselves, after a very hard push to make him a household name.
GameSack Game Sack  Always interesting reviews.
GameSack Croc was actually supposed to be a Yoshi game at first, but Nintendo disapproved and it was made for rival systems instead
GameSack Punki Skunk is so cute!
GameSack Vectorman and Billy Hatcher are side series, not mascots. People gotta do research before recording themselves play games.
GameSack Jersey Devil, and Blinx..
GameSack I cringed so hard when he said you shouldnt buy ChibiRobo. If you actually play the game and just keep cleaning as a side extrapoints you can eventually have a battery that never runs out. The story is extremely charming especially when you travel through time with aliens. I understand that some people may not like the game but thats no reason to completely bash it. I personally really dislike Pikmin. does that mean its a crap game that nobody should buy?  No, Im fine with you saying its a failed mascot(even though they made a new game a couple months ago), but to say that you shouldnt even purchase the game even for cheap was far too extreme.
GameSack I actually played punky skunk. It wasnt bad for its time, though those roller skate missions can go to hell.
GameSack Biggest mascot miss was definitely Crash and Spyro. Even now I could feel them being pushed in my face. Ugh. I will never forget those horrible Crash commercials.
GameSack hey i really liked billy hatcher.loved the soundtrack and plays nice(is mario sunshine more or less)
GameSack That punk skunk game looks like it should be on 16 bit consoles and looks like it shouldnt belong on the Playstation
GameSack you guys forget rayman who was forgetten back in the day but has made a comeback
GameSack chibi robo is awesome
GameSack vectorman was awesome
GameSack Im thirty seconds in and already mad. I love sonic.
GameSack Hopefully Im not the only one who thought other things once he said fanservice ...
GameSack snatcher Tshirt.....!? awesome.
GameSack Id say abe from oddworld
GameSack Vector man was ok but Croc was awsome since I had both. Im surprised u didnt mention about the third game in the series that didnt see the light of day. Also what about alex kidd? Segas first mascot before Sonic appeared and told him to get lost before he asked him to go kart racing?
GameSack I was really hoping you guys would show boogerman
GameSack you should try the pc version of croc 2 its got way better visuals and a further draw distance.
GameSack OH! Ive played Croc on PS2!!
GameSack Dave, isnt Samba actually called Amigo?
GameSack I realized three things. 1. These guys have no clue what a mascot is. 2. Someone never completed the Spydorz story in ChibiRobo. 3. This show is really mean spirited and opinionated.
GameSack i love billy hatcher anD th giant egg
GameSack Can anyone tell me what game the song came from during the credits. The fact that I cant pinpoint it is eating me up. And I dont think its from the list in the credits
GameSack I love gamesack! I just recently discovered your channel and its a gem that fills me with nostalgia and has a charm to it like no other. You guys are great, I hope you continue with gamesack for many years to come.
GameSack i think kid kool should be added hes becoming more and more forgotten most gamers i know and sega fanboys dont know of him
GameSack My first thought was Zool
GameSack Guys, you forgot to mention The SNES version of Captain Commando censored the blood, graphic deaths done by Mack the Knife, turned off death dismemberment, and a certain boss characters name has been altered.
GameSack Ristar and Gex! Crash Bandicoot has some success too.
GameSack Fuck your commercial.
GameSack In Captain Commando you have to input special commands for additional attacks. Read an FAQ or something at least if youre going to do a video on it.
GameSack I dislike the video. Vectorman wasnt bad, but thats not the reason I dislike the video.You have a video that matches the same style as others. Seems like everybody just likes to kill games that arent very known. Dont dislike me. Thumbs up if you feel like almost every opinion nowadays is a copycat of another one.By the way, Vectorman wast forgotten. SEGA still puts it in their collections.
GameSack sonic isnt in any way shape or form a failed mascot...
GameSack I miss Sparkster from Rocket Knight Adventures, Dynamite Headdy and Ristar...I loved those games. Great video, as always.
GameSack Hah, that was funI just wish I recognized more of these mascots. Dont think Ive actually played any of them but I know Captain Commando from MVC, Vectorman from friends and its inclusion on several Sega collections, and Punky Skunk because skunks are awesome and my favorite animal and I make it a point to know things about them.Id totally watch more of these if you wanted to release more lost mascot games.A few in particular Id love to see are Willy from Rockin Kats, Aero the AcroBat and Rocky Rodent. Just some ideas
GameSack They should add Bubsy, that generic cat. Now THAT, was a failed mascot.
GameSack Tell me where to get that Snatcher shirt right fucking now
GameSack Master Higgins and Wonder boy
GameSack What you mean by Shrek, its names actually Baron Dante.
GameSack Whats the name of the music track played during the end credits?
GameSack 5:15 theres plenty of fan service in this game...we clearly have a very different definition for Fan Service.
GameSack Another that springs to mind is Plok on the SNES... from what I remember it was a nice enough game, but I never felt any love for it whatsoever. Maybe it was the beeswasps... I cant handle those in games :(
GameSack I had to turn the video off due to stupidity. :( Vectorman has lots of variety and exploration, maybe learn to play video games? I did this when I was 7 years old!
GameSack Vectorman!!!.... FOREVER!!!!!
GameSack I cant believe you forgot about that bat thing from Sunsoft!
GameSack This was a great video and I love what you guys picked and talked about.
GameSack Not all of these are mascots.
GameSack lol...this dude is freaking hilarious. Well played. Shoulda told him we already had one testicularlyscrotum challenged Ranger (Zoma).
GameSack You guys know that was chief
GameSack THATS CHIEF!! he also has a youtube channel! Watch him on twitch! hes hilarious!:) http:www.twitch.tvthechief1114 :D
GameSack Ha ha this is AWESOME!!!
GameSack That was great. I always wondered what we sound like in another language. Thank You!
GameSack Hilarious! Great job!!
GameSack Das nukular ist der Knaller! Schn gemacht 3
GameSack Witzig und coole Aktion. Schau deren Videos auch gerne :)
GameSack Hier mchte ich euch in kurzer Humoristischer Form einen meiner Lieblingskanle vorstellen. :)
GameSack Catsle of Illusion  at the end.... well, every good cinema projector operator knows  that you turn off the projector AFTER the curtains are completly closed :)
GameSack No ChronoTrigger? Unsubbed, reported, blocked, unfriended, deported, extradited, hexed, fatwad, Barbara Streisand.
GameSack No Super Metroid, or Chrono Trigger. Im done.
GameSack I never understood how people generally prefer Revenge of Shinobi to Shinobi III, I just dont.
GameSack someone key me in on wtf is up with the gaiares cover they showed. I looked up the box and its... not that guy lol. but i saw ads with him, but no explanation.
GameSack Making top10s of the 8bit, 64bit and GameBoy times will probably break you guys down.Good luck though, I enjoyed the video even though there were other games in my list.
GameSack Super Metroid isnt even a top 10 SNES game.
GameSack I love the sound track to Road Rash...the way the Mega DriveGenesis tried to do guitar sounds great to me! :D
GameSack Wheres me my sanic? WHERES ME MY SANIC!? I join thejobloshow.
GameSack Whats the song that plays between games?
GameSack I find it odd that many of these picks are all early in the generation. Were there no great games later in the era?
GameSack Not generally what I would choose but a solid list. Id have Splatterhouse, UN Squadron, Phantasy Star 2, Super Metroid, Bomberman 93, Valis 3, Super Street Fighter 2, Ninja Warriors, Chrono Trigger, and Star Control on my top 10 in no order. CV 4 is an honorable mention though. As is Final Fantasy 6, Bonks Revenge, Phantasy Star 4, Shadow Dancer, and every 16 bit Monster World game.
GameSack Great vlog, I like the content. 16bit is my fav era and fully agree that SCIV is number one! Love that game!
GameSack I would have put Sonic The Hedgehog after SMW.
GameSack Rock and roll racing best
GameSack Why everybody is complaining about the games they havent mentioned.It is theirs top 10 not ours.If you all watch their show long enough than you know what kind of games they love.Metroid?Chrono trigger?We all know they excellent and I dont think everybody constantly have to tell us that they are.
GameSack gaiares has the worst cover i ever scene on a game box
GameSack My favorite YouTube channel congrats thanks for the many good looks at many great and fairly decent games and systems
GameSack 12:53 is that spiderman?
GameSack Say it as it is........You forgot to mention Streets of Rage 2.....Just say it... The problem with your taste is that its not even a taste to begin with.....
GameSack Some of my picks vary from yours therefore generic insult about your sexuality! But seriously Dave, Super Ghouls and Ghosts didnt surprise me at all since its awesome. People complain about certain rpgs not making your list, but if theyve watched even half of your other episodes, they would already know that you guys tend to like shooters and platformers more than other genres.
GameSack I wish I was equipped with blast processing :(
GameSack On super castlevania 4, at 20:26ish, the guy with the purple robe looks exactly like the guy on altered beast!?
GameSack Joe!!! How do you video capture your Sega Genesis! I have an El Gato Video capture that I hook to a VCR to get the Antenna inComposite Out converter. It works for NES and Super Nintendo, but I get black and white for GenesisMega Drive and Atari 2600! Please help me! I want color for Genesis!
GameSack Awsome new intro guys ! :)
GameSack best game show on the internet for sure!
GameSack I cant believe people are complaining about the intro, its incredible! So well edited. Heres to another 100 episodes :D
GameSack Shining Force II should be number one! I know that its niche, but its sadly overlooked!
GameSack respekt the metriod biatch.
GameSack No Super Metroid?Loss of all nerd cred
GameSack I feel all those games are worthy of awards and being up on those top 10 lists. Like Castlevania IV. Can play that even to this day and still not get bored with it.
GameSack The actual video starts at 2:57 people, seams like every time I come across your videos, the intro gets longer! WTF?!
GameSack WHERES SONIC!At least Super Mario World made the list
GameSack That intro was hella epic.
GameSack Please do more top tens!
GameSack I have Road Rash in my top 5 favorite 16bit games, I even bought the EA Replay for PSP just to play Road Rash on the go, but sadly the original music isnt there on the PSP version.
GameSack For me its a tough call NOT choosing Super Castlevania 4 but I think Id go with Chrono Trigger. I played it at the right time (13) and the story, music and graphics just blew me away. Ive played through it 91 times (yes I keep count) and never get tired of it. I play it at least a few times a year because its just that good.
GameSack SCIV nr. 1... Cmon...
GameSack best Game Sack opening ever
GameSack Congrats on 100 episodes!!! I think Gaiares looks more like a Thunder Force II upgrade,and also why wasnt any of the Sonic games on the list?
GameSack Joe  Dave be sure to party hard!! You guys are the best! The amount of work you put into your clips is astonishing! Keep it up! And never give up! Ill be here to help you up  Youve just been GAMESACKED, BITCH! YOU CATCH MY DRIFT!Edit: Holy crap was I shitfaced. oO, still, you guys rock! :D
GameSack your intro is too long and it sucks. Seriously
GameSack great list... but Rondo of Blood  Super Castlevania IV
GameSack Great show guys! Really enjoyed the special intro! Interesting choices in the list. Surprised there was no version of Street Fighter II on either list but the 1 on 1 fighting genre doesnt seem to really be the top choice for either of you guys.
GameSack Great show guys! Really enjoyed the special intro! Interesting choices in the list. Surprised there was no version of Street Fighter II on either list but the 1 on 1 fighting genre doesnt seem to really be the top choice for either of you guys.
GameSack I do agree with number 1, but the side scrolling flyingshooter of sega i would have changed to UN Squadron
GameSack 1 is Final Fantasy VI.pretty much a no brainer
GameSack I remember to this day how i got CV4 my dad had bought it the day it came out and was his all time favorate game and gave me his copy when i was 4 along with the SNES (im now 21 and still have it) and i even have a tape of my 4th birthday and all you hear is the awesome music of the game as me and friends played it
GameSack Cool list. Ive never heard of that shooter game, but Ill have to give it a try. I would have added Demons Crest and Actraiser 2 to the list.I really enjoyed Castlevania 4, but... I found the final battle a bit disappointing  Dracula doesnt turn into a demon! As I recall, his face just changes a bit or something.
GameSack I liked Dave list it had all the best games. I was so so on Joes list, but they were solid choices. Oh yeah Happy 100th Episode. I also want to say thanks for having your channel. I have a Super NES and Sega Genesis, but I was trying to figure out what games to buy for them. Thanks to all your suggestion, my collection is coming along nicely. PS: Thanks for introducing me to the Sharp X68000, I love Etoile Princesse.
GameSack How in the blue  is it possible that there is no Streets of Rage game in this top 10?!
GameSack Top ten super grafx games. Oh wait....
GameSack I would include road rash and Dracula x for pc engine CD in my top ten 16 bit list also.Overall good game choices on the video but for the rest of the list I would choose other games. The only thing that hurts me from the video is that SCIV was choosen as number 1!Many people loves super castlevania IV and will agree with was a good choice but for me...is so overrated. Is too easy, slow and boring. I rented when was released back on the day and I was very disappointed. I suposse has good ambient music I must give it that...Dracula X for Snes is even worst than SCIV...For other side I consider Dracula X for pc engine CD an amazing game.
GameSack This is the craziest top ten ive ever seen!
GameSack what game is that music from playing at 2:55?
GameSack You guys didnt mention how you can change the turtles skin color in Turtles IV so that they match the action figures! Have you been checking your options menu?
GameSack Original choices, honorable mentions.... good stuff.
GameSack Had a good laugh. Nice top ten and congrats on your 100th episode.
GameSack Super Metroid is my number one 16bit game.
GameSack (wipes tear) Ive been with you guys since the beginning! Just under a different username, because you know...Google. Oh, how they grow so fast.
GameSack Ha ha ha. Loved the Super Metroid bit at the end. In fact, your little epilogues at the end of your videos routinely make me laugh out loud. (Watched the Sharp X68000 one last night, and I loved the delivery at the end.)
GameSack What No final fantasy 3, Donkey King Country?
GameSack Ive never beaten Super Castlevania 4!
GameSack correct me if im wrong but I believe Battletoads did the whole throw the enemy at the screen to beat the boss thing 1st.....not tmnt.
GameSack Great list!! ... and a hilarious Altered Beast joke!
GameSack Wow these guys are faggots
GameSack Your list is different than mine ... therefore I hate you dumb dummies.
GameSack Isnt that the bad guy from Altered Beast in Super Castlevania 4? he is on the hallway where the torches light up
GameSack when these guys talk, it reminds me of derek roddy. most be from the same part of the us
GameSack Can anybody who had the patience to wait through that crap ass intro give me the rundown...
GameSack Intro is waaaaaay too long.
GameSack I think its interesting that you use the term Welcoming to your doom at 27:28. Theres a character oddly enough that looks like the same one from Altered Beast that says Welcome to your doom!
GameSack Oh I just noticed u played a chrono trigger song in the background at the end!!! What a cock tease
GameSack Castle of Illusion was classic. How about that log witch, huh? Make more top 10s! More, dammit!
GameSack LOL the dog from call of duty.
GameSack Congrats on 100... Ill be waiting for 200 :)
GameSack I really think you guys keep getting better and better! I cannot wait for the next 100!
GameSack Sack Sack Sack! ...kutgw guys :)
GameSack contra 3 should be on that list
GameSack Your intro is a sack of wank
GameSack 1:24 1:47 thats one big sack
GameSack Ive just downloaded Shinobi 3 on the 3DS. That double jump is a bitch lol
GameSack totally agree super metroid is fuckin awesome and my fav game of all time
GameSack Nice list guys!! I agree with most of it
GameSack If your not gonna do video game reviews, just review the franchise.
GameSack ranma yes best fighter ever lol.
GameSack How can you not have seen DBZ?
GameSack If this is the other, where is the video with the first 16bit list?Did you mean the other except SF and MK?
GameSack Is the SNES version of Killer Instinct better than the Xbox One version? Besides the pay to play aspect.
GameSack In strip fighter you win a fight than quickly got to fap fap fap...
GameSack Really had enjoyment with trutles too. It was a strong fighter.
GameSack So, no NeoGeo games at all?
GameSack Surprised there was no Primal Rage.
GameSack Gundam Wing: Endless Duel is one of the best fighting games for that era IMO. Such a shame they didnt bother releasing it here.Good fighting system, graphics, music, and awesome super moves.
GameSack Other 16 bit fighting games to take a look at: Power Moves. It was a bizarre fighting game that features some, at times, pretty phoneomal animation. Its really interesting mostly because of the way its set up. Its interesting to see a fighting game that is trying hard not to copy SF2 or MK, for better or worse.
GameSack Hey you should try out DragonballZ: Hyper Dimension. I had a blast with that game. Tight controlls, unique characters with different abilties. Although being quite easy it is still a hell lot of fun.
GameSack Clay Fighter tournament edition was quite better than the first one. Hey how about Primal Rage?
GameSack Hah, is Dave getting burnt out on gamesack?
GameSack Oh my god, why is Gosunkugi fighting against Akane???
GameSack Are you kidding me? Budokan 2 was the best of the DBZ series on SNES.
GameSack Brutal: Paws of Fury. Oh god, its horrendous.
GameSack Did i miss Shaq fu? )
GameSack Snk fighters are way better than capcom fighters. And the neo get was a 16th it console as well so why no fighters from them? Oh wait now I get if you included them in this video the video would have been named neogeo fighting games because they would have taken the spot from these shitty fighting games you showed.
GameSack WATCH THE SHOW AND YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND THE STORY!!!
GameSack I do not agree with his comments on Eternal champions at all. The game had good music and graphically had better graphics than street fighter or mortal kombat when it came out on genesis. The game was fun and Eternal champions on sega cd was fun as hell. This guy seems to be kind of biased in my opinion. All my friends with super Nintendo always commented on the games graphics and music back in the day about how good they were.
GameSack I think you can set the controls in Ranma 12: Hard Battle to use up to jump.
GameSack Rise of the Robots ftw :P
GameSack kensei sacred fist ps one, and fightermaker one. :) fatal fury wild ambition.
GameSack The being too far apart from each other thing in the DBZ game mimics the actual anime, which is infamous for multiple 20minute episodes of people staring down each other.
GameSack never thought Strip Fighter was an actual game...
GameSack BOOduhkahn? OoHow does one get that from Budokan??In Dragon Ball Z: Super Butden 2, Im pretty sure you can dash left and right with the L Button and the R Button respectfully.
GameSack jajaja about the Dragon ball z game, if you see the anime you will understand whast going on there... anyway.... good video boys!! :)
GameSack We played Eternal Champions a lot.Then I got the Sega CD version which was even cooler.
GameSack What no wipeout?!? You monsters!
GameSack Wingnut does not have an advantage over everyone because of his projectile. it is a well balanced game. i may only know one character well (Donatello) but i know that i can beat that proctile by jumping, my projectile, headspin attack, or back dash flip. its just like any other good fighting game. every move has pros and cons
GameSack Any reason you didnt list any of the SNK fighters? Even if you limited it to the SNES or Genesis ports.
GameSack No Weaponlord? That was a fun SNES game, though a bit sluggish at times. And yes, there is also a Genesis port.
GameSack Play Dragon Ball Z Ultimate Boudakai, and or Boudakai tenkenachi 2. It will walk you through the storyline perfectly and teach you what is going on in that game. Both very fun fighting games.
GameSack How do you make a show about other fighters and do not put any snk games......?
GameSack gamesack is awesome x.x
GameSack havent watch ranma 12 and havent watch dragon ball z??
GameSack Great job. You forgot to mention that eternal champions had zero combos
GameSack You didnt even covered rhe good ones... power rangers fighting edition and weaponlord, or any of takaras snk ports
GameSack Good job completely ignoring SNK.. King of Fighters, The Samurai Shodowns, Last Blades, the Fatal Furys, the Art of Fightings,the World Heroes, Matrimelee, Mark of the Wolves... you owe us a Neo Geo episode now! :)
GameSack Watch Dragon ball z you will love it
GameSack Where the fuck is King of Fighters?
GameSack Slaughter sport for the genesis. Do that one!
GameSack You missed World Heroes. Pretty much a Street Fighter rip off but it was really fun. The second one especiallly.
GameSack i got that clay fighter for the snes you right that game gets old fast lol. great video best believe ill be there for the next video as well
GameSack Shaq Fu, Power Rangers, Fatal Fury, and Final Fight are pretty glaring omissions for better or worse.
GameSack If there is a next time? who knows? Mmm is this potentially the last ever episode then?
GameSack That was a pretty cool episode, brought back a lot of memories. Theres TONNES of extra unlockable characters in Eternal Champions challenge from the darkside, I think theres about 1012 unlockables ranging in quality from whoa sweet to really?
GameSack Virtua Fighter  The beginning of Tekken
GameSack World Heroes and Super Variable Geo for the Super Famicom.
GameSack only killer instinct is good all other games are shit
GameSack Having played DB Budokai 2 to the death back in the day when my cousin had it, I can tell you the game has dash key. L or R I think to dash left or right, you can make a homing fireball chase you and lead it back to the guy who shot it. I agree its not... really a good game at the time but I have to give it credit for having a beam clash system, not only superior to the cheat sword clash system that Samurai Shodown failed to implement correctly, but really makes the game like its source material. :3
GameSack Doomsday warrior for the snes.
GameSack love this episode, been a fan since day 1...I believe
GameSack Fatal fury and world heroes
GameSack Ive seen Game Sack almost always rag on graphics, especially early 3d ones, but in my opinion graphics are only bad if they hinder your playing experience.
GameSack no power instinct, no primal rage, no double dragon V no art of fighting, no fatal fury, no samurai showdown, no astral bout, no battle masters...what is this? only shitty snes and sega fighting games?
GameSack You should Dragon the Bruce Lee Story. It not only a great movie based game but also a great realistic fighting game
GameSack So, and what about an episode about Kart games? Everyone knows about Crash Team Racing, Mario Kart 64 (and all the other Mario Karts). But having played a TON of those games, the only ones that I actually found very fun back in the day, were Speed Freaks and Chocobo Racing. Would be nice to have an episode covering all those alternatives, the average uninformed person was completely oblivious to.
GameSack I feel like by the time TMNT Tourney Fighters came out, the Turtles popularity had waned
GameSack What about Amiga fighters? Shadow Fighter, Elfmania, FIghtin Spirit? Each of these was in my opinion far better (gfxwise, at least) than the games covered here.
GameSack Gundam Wing: Endless Duel for the Super Famicom is awesome. Played it to death when I was a kid.
GameSack Satuday Night Slammasters. Its a fighting game with prowrestling elements and it has Haggar from Final Fight. It also has a connection to Street Fighter.
GameSack I remember back in the day I would try to play every single fighting game that came out because I thought they were ALL awesome...but after watching this video I see that most of the fighting games that werent made by capcom or snk were garbage. I was so jealous of eternal champions since I didnt have a sega. Not so much now....
GameSack some SNK boss Syndrome, you guys outta talk about that one day
GameSack You guys should cover the game Iron  Blood: Warriors of Ravenloft... the DD fighting game for the PSOne.
GameSack My problem with some of the 16bit fighters (Eternal Champions, Art of Fighting, the Karnov one, in example) is that I dont even get to know if I suck or not, because I can barely move! You start your first fight in a game you dont even know, and the A.I counterattacks EVERYTHING you do, stuns you, get close and kill you. I hate that kind of games.
GameSack Good video, but it was to long
GameSack There was a halfway descent fighting game for the SNES  SFC called Ultimate Fighter (or Hiryuu No Ken in Japan). Its part side scroller  part fighting game. Another half way descent game was Deadly Moves for the Sega Genesis. The main mode you were limited to only playing as the main character (Joe), but in Vs Mode, you could choose to play as the others. I never played Power Moves for the SNES, but I understand it was the same game with a different name.I also liked playing Clay Fighter  Killer Instinct. I managed to kill some time playing Eternal Champions. I have always thought of it as a poor mans Street Fighter 2 game. Im surprised you didnt mention the fact that your special moves were limited by the amount of inner strength you had  that when you insult your opponent, it drains their inner strength. That to me is what made E.C. so difficult to play. Xavier was my favorite character because he could change opponents into other characters.
GameSack 12:33 Hmmm... Thats just like that stage from street fighter 4.
GameSack do you guys consider neogeo 16bit or 24bit?
GameSack Are you guys eer gonna do a Q and A episode? I think you guys are awesome yet I know nothing about you...So I have a couple of questions to ask you? Dave what is your favorite Nintendo game as well Sega game? Joe, you the same...Joe, Youve stated that youve been doing videos like these well into into the nineties, what motivated you to do videos now and why? question to the both of you? Who came up with the idea with game sack and why that name? What do you guys think of modern games vs retro games? By far what are your favorite game series and why?Alright...a little about me...My favorite system is the Snes and my favorite series is the final fight series, favorite character cody. my favorite Sega series is Shinobi (not including the ds version) I.ve always wanted to do videos but never knew where to start though I have lots of ideas...I love retro games for one reason, originality! NOBODY HAS ANYTHING NEW TO OFFER SINCE THE PS ONE ERA....with that said there are two series that stand out and they are God Of War and the M.G.S series, not including rising or Revengence or whate er.. Hey, i have tons of questions and few little time...Id love to hear from you guys though...
GameSack I remmember eternal champions dat game is f king hard I couldnt beat my 1st opponet also yu yu hakusho final is a good fighting game for snes itz only in jap tho
GameSack Another great video guys. Thanks!
GameSack KI was. Good fighting game used to kick butt people line up to watch me and my old friends play nothing better then 20 30 people around also mortal kombat was huge and we locked ass this my friend was way better coulddo 30 hit combos lolgoos old days miss that
GameSack Another amazing fighting game is Gundam Wing Endless duel for the SNES! It was released in 1996, really late on the SNES life, and it really shows it because its an arcadelike experience on the SNES! It has huge sprites, smooth and amazing animation, the controlls are pretty good, and the game itself is A LOT of fun! I dont know if it was released outside of Japan though... But I think it wasnt...
GameSack Yo, you keep describing charge attacks like mortal kombat created them. street fighter did it first.you two are hella mislead.
GameSack Where the fuck is Fatal Fury...?You do not know a fuck.
GameSack amazing compilation, someone had to do it
GameSack tekken 3 actually had a 2d fighting game
GameSack the dude in the turbografx shirt looks like his brain is made of bread.1:22 makoto from third strike?
GameSack non SF2MK 16 bit games you didnt mention,Godzilla destroy all monsters: you mightve heard of Godzilla destroy all monsters melee, Godzilla unleashed, and Godzilla save the earth on the original Xbox and ps2 but Godzilla destroy all monsters on the super famicom is the Godzilla game we deserved as kids! Its one you should check this one out, its really good, and its a lot better that those cruddy GodzillaGodzilla 2 super Godzilla games by Toho (btw i like toho as a movie company but not a video game company) But its ok that you didnt show it because its very obscure and was only released in japan. Its something that you should add to your licensed fighting game collection. (now thinking of it, licensed fighting games are pretty good. TMNT tournament fighters (SNES version), dragon ball z butoden 2, and Godzilla 2v2 fighting games (destroy all monsters, destroy all monster melee, Godzilla unleashed, Godzilla save the earth)
GameSack 1:30, you can see his balls...
GameSack I noticed that when I miss my shots I swear like crazy
GameSack Someone needs a change of pants...
GameSack Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed the videos!
GameSack I had more fun watching this than the real Superbowl, cause the Broncos actually put up a fight against the Seahawks. :PBut no offence though, this was nice to watch. :)
GameSack Happy birthday, Jon (a day late, I know)!
GameSack I rooted for denver this super blow 48
GameSack Night Slashers was such a badass game to me when I was little, horror beat em up? Fuck yeah and then some :D Would love to see this somehow show up on PSNXBLA or anywhere possible for a rerelease
GameSack battletoads for the arcades uses the same sound chip found in most pinball machines of the time.
GameSack Guys great channel just found you and subed
GameSack battletoads was released nes snes genesis lol and mame woot :P
GameSack XD Man, you spent more time on the floor than fighting!With quarter donors like you I wonder how the arcades are dead.BETMARK
GameSack DO a video on jazzjackrabbit 2 plz !
GameSack Guys, Id love to see you play the arcade game of Asterix, which was released here in Europe. Its a scrolling beatemup by Konami, masters of the genre. I know youd love it.
GameSack Could you do Jazz Jackrabbit (first for DOS, couldnt care less for JJ2) review, please?
GameSack Great episode. I want to play Night Slasher so badly now.
GameSack Hey guys, correct me if I am wrong but have you guys done a 3do episode?If you havent can you? Thanks love your guys show.
GameSack Thanks for the video, really enjoyed seeing DJ Boy again!
GameSack GAME SACK play BIO MECHANICAL TOY. ITS AMAZING AND WAS ONLY RELEASED IN SPAIN.
GameSack Id love to see some fighting games on an episode of Left in the Arcade. Maybe BloodStorm by Strata.
GameSack Its a damn shame that Mystic Warriors was never ported (hell, dont even on XBLAPSN), such a badass game.
GameSack the soundboard of the last game is like simpsons
GameSack great episode! nice choose of arcade games!, arcade hidden gems..
GameSack 1 hardcore oldschool gamer channel on Youtube, nothing else even comes close.
GameSack When are you guys going to make another episode of left on the arcade?
GameSack Ummm hello?! Battle toads WAS released for the NES...
GameSack Ive got some more arcade titles for you guys to try. Theyre all beatemups except for the first one(because I love that genre).The 2 Atomic Punk(Bomberman) games. Im pretty sure they were never ported to any console.Mug Smashers. I wouldnt say its great, but its pretty decent. Its kind of humorous too.Crime Fighters. It plays a bit slow when your beating up on people, but is a pretty good game.Mutation Nation. This one is very good, although Im not sure what all the letters do that you can pick up. Im also not sure what buttons 3 and 4 do.The Legend of Silkroad. Not sure if youd want to include this. It depends on what you guys think if it. I think its an okay game, but definitely not that great. In my opinion, its not a big loss that it never got ported.Knuckle Bash is a neat and very strange little beatemup.Ninja Clowns. In my opinion this game is pretty terrible. The only reason Im listing it is that everyone has different tastes and opinions, so its possible one of you guys might actually like it.Legionnaire. This one doesnt work on my version of MAME, so I have no idea if its good of not, but it looked like it might be.Dungeon Magic. This is an excellent game! It even has RPG elements and an isometric view that Im sure Dave will love, lol.
GameSack Guys, if you plan to do a fourth one of these then please add Tumblepop, it was only ever released on the original gameboy
GameSack Blood Bros....the inspiration for NATSUMEs Wild Guns on the Super Nintendo? If not, its sure close.
GameSack some of these games look fucking badass  MUST BUILD MAME ARCADE MACHINE WITH HANDS AND WOOD AND SHIT!!!!
GameSack There used to be a vertical shooter in Pizza Hut. You could either be an airplane or I think the tankcar. Does anybody know what arcade cabinet this was?
GameSack Blood Bros. kinda reminds me of Wild Guns.
GameSack Wow, nice looking games Ive never seen before good review guys.
GameSack Cadillacs and dinosaurs! Beast beat em up I ever played. It never got to home consoles.
GameSack There was Mat Mania a very old wrestling game I thought for sure was coming to the Sega Master System and Dangar a vertically scrolling shooter where you play the role of a robot that splits into 3 pieces then reassembles and if you get hit you become only 1 of the pieces and you have to gradually put yourself back together as you progress through the game.
GameSack guy you should look up blue journey it pretty fun and for the neo geo
GameSack You should mention which beatemups have 4player mode. It may not matter to you, but it does to me and probably other people. Thats the main reason I own boards for Hook, Mystic Warriors, Bucky OHare, and every other 4player board Ive been able to find.For your next Left in the Arcades you should do Karate Blazers from Video System. Thats a funny and interesting beatemup.
GameSack wow blood brothers looks like wild guns on the snes. a lot.Have you guys done a video on hidden NES games? Im sure but if you have I havent seen it yet.
GameSack great video! I recommend you to play Psychic 5, even if theres a japanese version called Esper Boukentai for NES but is different from the arcade, which is awesome!
GameSack They need to bring these games on a retro store area on PS3360Wii U
GameSack Loved the episode...until you ripped on Klax at the end!!! :)
GameSack Get the PCBs and a Supergun? You dont need to buy or setup a full cabinet...
GameSack Night Slasher does look good. Wish Sony would get the license to past arcade games like Night Slasher and Sunset Riders, these type of games would be great on the PS Vita.
GameSack I asume u guys used an emulator for this, which one did u use?
GameSack Cant wait for the new episode today! Game Sack is favorite show online or on TV. You guys rock. Let me get a wazzzzuuuupppppp from Dave!
GameSack Why didnt B Rap Boys get ported to American home consoles? Probably punching lions and a black kid flying around throwing watermelons at you had something to do with it. :
GameSack i was gonna watch this.. and then i saw the green screen. and paused the video, and now im leaving. pathetic attempt at a game channel. really.
GameSack Redifer u sold ur house and moved u and ur wife into a studio apartment? Bummer.
GameSack Alligator Hunt by Gaelco
GameSack Thanks Game Sack. How bout those Broncos? Lol
GameSack Would love to play bucky o hare.
GameSack Theres a super fun arcade beatemup called Vendetta that never got a home release (as far as I know). Its challenging at first, but once you learn the bosses patterns you can get pretty far in the game on a single credit.The controls are great, and the special moves are easy to pull off. They dont drain your life bar, and yet dont unbalance the game. The Japanese version actually includes fetish villains wearing leather chaps who attack you by trying to hump you...!I could die happy if you included this game in your next Left in the Arcade!
GameSack I have a suggestion. Have you guys ever played APB (All Points Bulletin) from 1987? Its a great arcade game and I dont think it ever got a console release. What a shame! :(
GameSack Any thoughts on The First Funky Fighter?
GameSack My nominations for a 4th video: the conspicuous absences of Segas arcade racers  Indy 500, Super GT  Scud Race, Daytona 2...
GameSack Life is too difficult, flashmob attack go back to your Xbox and Aqua Deadlight. YOU MIGHT GET THAT VIRTUAL ITEM!!
GameSack Great episode. These games look awesome especially Mystic Warriors. Its a shame they never made it to consoles...
GameSack Game Sack  a must watch for me these days. Thanks fellas, also recommending you to friends.
GameSack Sorry... Some of the games were too bloody for me... X(
GameSack Some good games there I will check them out. Thank you.
GameSack 8:25 How dare you slander Game sack Dave!!? There may be cheesy jokes, poor segways and crummy voice over delivery, but lame is no way to talk about this fine show. Apologize!!
GameSack There was a game on the SNES called wild guns which seems very similar to blood brothers
GameSack I wouldve love to hear your thoughts on Metamorphic Force
GameSack Golden Axe: Revenge of Death Adder!
GameSack Awesome. Always wanted to see a home version of Rad Mobile and Wing War. Sonic the Hedgehog arcade would be cool too. Thanks!
GameSack 13:05 That really is total badass! Same goes for all the little details!By the way, Merry Christmas! XD
GameSack Love this segment. Hope you do more of them. Where is this arcade in the background?
GameSack Another great video. Keep up the good work.
GameSack At home on the Sega Dreamcast where they belong. Not the Sega Saturn
GameSack Wild guns from natsume on the snes seems like a spiritual succesor to blood bros. except no goofy cabal dance XD
GameSack most of those games are on home system
GameSack I really enjoy Game Sack. I appreciate to what both of you do. Did you play The Punisher (arcade game) or battel circuit? I really like both of them.
GameSack MORE... MORE... MOOOOOREEE...
GameSack Great episode! Thanks for turning me on to Boogie Wings: that games kerraaaazy!!
GameSack We need a 3DO episode!
GameSack Um Battletoads did see a console release. There were 3 Battletoads titles. Battletoads (NES, Amiga, Genesis and Game Gear), Battletoads in Battlemaniacs (SNES and Master System) and Battletaods  Double Dragon (NES, Sega Mega DriveGenesis, SNES and Game Boy). No offence, but you guys need to do a little research before making a claim.
GameSack Where do you guys get all your cool shirts? Do you Make them? Do you buy them? If so, where?
GameSack Sweet Game Sack shirt Joe!!! Where do we pick one up?
GameSack For your next episode try Hammerin Harry! Damn I loved that game.
GameSack hey can you guys look for an arcade game that i played when i was young, but i cant remember the name. its a isometric shoot em up with repitlianlizardmen bad guys i think. there were different weapons you could get and i think you could even fly in some sort of ship. the landscape reminded me of levels in marble madness. also i think the title had a very scifi ring to it, kinda like planet of the lizard people in 3D or something. have you come across that ever? keep up the good work.
GameSack Hippodrome, Red Earth, WWF WrestleFest, Warrior Blade: Rastan Saga Episode III, XMen, Best Bout Boxing and Metamoqester,
GameSack S.P.Y (Special Project Y) made by Konami in 1989, Crime Fighters made by Konami in 1989,  Sly Spy made by Data East in 1989.
GameSack Data East: The king of hidden gems
GameSack There was a Wild West Cowboys of Moomesa arcade game that played a lot like Sunset Riders. While I didnt care for the show or comics, the game was actually really fun.
GameSack Night Slashers looks awesome! Good call!
GameSack Check out Shadow Force. It looks like a good beat em up.
GameSack I played Battletoads, which was at one arcade I went to once in a while. From what Ive read, it wasnt in wide release. Dont recall seeing any of the others, but I didnt start going to arcades a lot until 1994.That slanted elevator level at 7:53 was also used in one of the Ninja Turtles games, either 3 or 4, dont remember which.
GameSack surprised they didnt mention Aliens the arcade game, that to me is still the coolest Alien game ever made but for some odd reason it never got a console release..
GameSack Sailor Moon game beatemup for mame !
GameSack I love me some Game Sack I surely do.
GameSack good info, nice humor, excellent reviews
GameSack I swear if Battletoads and Bucky O Hare get put on XBLA I will fucking buy that shit twice.One for myself and another for my bro.
GameSack Oh! Bucky OHare! I loved so much that game I played it till I was able to finish it with one credit using Jenny (Seriously: the cat chick had the best special attack IMHO. Not the strongest one but surely the smartest one!) and I would still play it.
GameSack YEAH GIRL! You use that keyboard )
GameSack i dont like sunny days either xD
GameSack Without your mouse you cant point out soft beards :
GameSack Love it! This a super fun series, keep it up girl!
GameSack awe sweetie. 3 Great vid as per the usual!
GameSack Wheres for immortal sisters
GameSack im not a morning person at all either, as seen by my username )
GameSack You are great I wish I was you
GameSack another great episode, so glad you had a fantastic birthday, xx
GameSack You make me miss consoleHalo, Major. Those customs we used to play were a lot of fun :)
GameSack The series thing is a really great idea man! Go for it. If you need any ideas on the setup let me know....I already have stuff in mind
GameSack I would love to participate in this 2v2 thing! It sounds like a ton of fun, and I really want to get better at the game too. That is a great idea.I havent gotten a chance to try out the new action sack stuffs yet, but paintball sounds really interesting.
GameSack Modest Major King of the scrubs
GameSack Fun and crazy gameplay to watch. Ill have to give action sack a try again (sadly since the TS reset action sack is my highest CSR lol). That doubles series thing sounds pretty awesome!! Id be interested (as a youtuber trying to get better)
GameSack Ill do the series thing, but is it alright if Raps and I are on a team? Hes q YouTuber, Im a semi competitive player, we hell each other out, we get burgers, he comes back to my place, we get it on for the rest of the night with H4
GameSack i know how you feel about csr.i hate it..once you get to certain level it matches u up against clans and shit..i love competative but i like casual too..i wish 343 would at least reset csr every month..they gave into the pressure from the mlg community when it comes to csr..its bullshit..and i believe they lost people because of the csr..most players play more on the casual side
GameSack The 2v2 thing sounds cool man, good commentary btw!
GameSack good vid ! hoe many kills ?
GameSack oooh ooh! Can I be one of the semicompetitive player on one of the teams? GT is HAGSTROMS if you wanna make sure Im decent at the game.
GameSack I hate the map for husky raid. It always turns into binary rifle spawn camping from across the map
GameSack Couldnt get a hang of paintball, husky raid was pretty cool though.
GameSack I played this gametype for about an hour and it was so fun! I remember playing this gametype in Halo 3 and Reach and just having a blast. The only issue I have with it is when I get these great games, I feel like I cheated my way in here to gain a high KD ingame and multikills. I might just do a highlight video because it is way to easy to do well in here XD
GameSack New series sounds good. For the competitive stream, Id start sooner than your comfortable with since it would definitely be entertaining to see your evolution as a player. Most of us who play casually never think were good enough to play competitively. It would be nice to see how you manage the learning curve. Keep it up!
GameSack I wish that they would add multiple husky raid maps because I dislike this one.HATE IT
GameSack Im will to do it if your willing to teach)
GameSack that gametype is so much fun. And i so much look forward to seeing you do competitive games :) your be a beast 3
GameSack The 2v2 things sounds awesome. Let me know if you need any help.Action Sack made a huge improvement. I always thought it needs to have all the crazy stupid games that are played just for fun.
GameSack Love it hope to see it soon will not be able to be that helper but soon
GameSack This whole competitive gaming YouTuber plus semiMLG dude thing would definitely be interesting in the way of seeing who gets on this show you know. Gameplaywise, Ive never been a fan of extremely competitive games because of how little action takes place. Nade throws all the time running for cover. I know these are essential, I just hope that you, as a really good youtuber w great ideas, will be able to bring something new to the table in a sense that it will be entertaining to watch. Also if these gameplays were on DLC maps(monolith, skyline the small maps) it would be even more interesting to watch because of the map chemistry. Im not saying forge maps are a step backward, Im just saying that there isnt much variety in the way that forge maps play out e.g. Sniper Rifle is the only power weapon for says. If you control that, youre gonna dominate and it isnt gg to be interesting you know what I mean? Anyways, thanks for the vid. Great gameplay.
GameSack You overestimate the number of people who know csr exists.
GameSack That idea is really interesting!!
GameSack Ill do the series thing, but is it alright if Raps and I are on a team? Hes q YouTuber, Im a semi competitive player, we hell each other out, we get burgers, he comes back to my place, we get it on for the rest of the night with H4
GameSack The background music is excellent.
GameSack Thank Satan for emulators...
GameSack That seems like a pretty cool computer, and I like the way the case is deigned, thanks fr the episode guys
GameSack My favorite game on the computer is Castlevania. Although I cant beat stage 4s Medusa boss its still fun but would recommend the PSX version for anyone especially the psOne classics version for 6.
GameSack DO NOT KEEP YOUR POWER PACKBLOCKS PLUGGED IN...or they WILL DIE!Especially the original Nintendo. Just put your hand on the original Nintendo power pack while it is plugged in...its very, very warm and easily burnt out
GameSack 23:23 HOLD ON A SEC !!! Was that a Black TWINBEE ?
GameSack This is one my favorite systems. Its just a step below Fujitsus FM Towns I feel, but thats not a strike against it.. id have been more than happy to have one back in the days I was lusting over the Super Gun system id never have.Excellent system synopsis here, hits almost everything.
GameSack That is one amazing PC. A real shame they demand such prices.
GameSack That music at the end was the summer event music from FFXIV wasnt it?
GameSack Wanna see you guys do a episode on Tandy
GameSack They are rare and yet you have FOUR OF THEM? Just lol.
GameSack 22:40This is one of the coolest things Ive seen.
GameSack love that they always have long videos these guys
GameSack Id love to see a MSX episode, as it was the home of the first games of the Metal Gear Solid franchise. Also Ive heard the MSX was used as guiding system for the missiles of the Brazilian army. Thats a very warring computer right there.
GameSack 3000? (that would have been what, 2000?!) I can see why it was Japan only, no way would it have competed with Atari STs (which had a builtin MIDI interface if not an actual synth) or Commodore Amigas at a quarter of the price (at most) in the UK, yeah it matched the Amiga 2000 for price but we had the A500 and even the Archimedes was cheaper. Though I bet if it was launched in the UK, Cumana would have sold external 5.25 drives for the X68030 (or 3.5 drives)X68K Star Wars very much like the Atari Coin Op. Japan gets Mad Stalker, the rest of us get Rise Of The Sodding RobotsThe music on X68K is second to none, it basically is arcade hardware from the late 80s early 90s, much more powerful than the competition, 80 shoot em ups are a waste of the system though.
GameSack For whats its worth, Mad Stalker on PC Engine is same game (with minor changes to stage design), but with better graphics.
GameSack I love you guys. These videos are what I always wanted to see on youtube. I hope the copyright police never touch you.
GameSack Actually I ONLY watch your videos because it runs over 30mins., I just cant be arsed getting up every 5 mins to click on another utube vid. The Sharp X68000 was unbelievable back in its time, in the UK it was only ever talked about in the high echelon circles and most brits thought it was almost mythological, I am still amazed how it was able to cope with the later games better than SNES and GEN
GameSack This is the Best documentary Ive seen in like forever. I love it
GameSack The US version of Space Harrier for the C64 also used stripes instead of a checkerboard floor. Of course the EuropeanUK one just had a plain gray floor.
GameSack People go one about how great the X68000 is compared to consoles of the time, but at 3000 its little wonder. Even the Neo Geo was cheap in comparison. I dont think its at all relevant to compare the X68000 to the PCEngine, Mega Drive or SNES. Anyway, at least people can enjoy the machine these days.
GameSack The game you called salamander, is actually called life force salamander and was also ported to te NES
GameSack Because losers do not play THE COCKPIT!
GameSack Awesome ending!! I laughted a lot!
GameSack Damn it guys now i want an X68000. Great episode as usual :)
GameSack As usual great episode. I just had to watch it again. Im drawn to the X68000 for some strange reason, maybe its my love for old school Capcom and Konami games and they seem to show the X68000 a lot of love.Also I love the different midi devises . Thx again for a great episode, quality as always !!!
GameSack The purple enemies in Return of Ishtar look like Grimace.
GameSack Why thunder force 2 on the X68000 looks the same as on the genesis is because they both use the Motorola 68000 Video chip
GameSack You guys never skimp on info and games when covering a console. You cater to folks who like all genres. Also best fx and capture for youtube retro game channel. Keep it up.
GameSack These shows just keep getting more and more amazing!
GameSack i never heard of sharp making a pc like console....thumbs up..ghost and ghouls looked great i thing...nice version.. overall the music was real great. ..a shame other consoles didnt do the same
GameSack Really great piece of retro gear I never knew existed! Thanks for another great episode guys. Really want to get one of these now! Love all the external nonsense you can hook up to it. MIDI ftw! P lol
GameSack Cool episode guys! Where did you guys get your X68000? Because its definitely something Id like to pick up!
GameSack I really want one of these systems, you guys are lucky to have one.
GameSack the cockpit actually seemed good
GameSack Can it use windows os?
GameSack You guy should do Amiga.
GameSack Losers dont play The Cockpit... but winners dont do drugs. Im confused hahaha.
GameSack I hope you guys do a PC98 episode soon
GameSack What?? Where is ANGEL DIVE??
GameSack some sega games looked like they had scaling. they played it off pretty good.
GameSack Good ep. Very informative!
GameSack Game Sack is the shiznit o bam Sally!
GameSack 6:32 Dave said jerk off, I thought this was a family program!
GameSack I just have to say, you guys do a fantastic job and I always find myself eagerly anticipating your next episode!!! Great works guys!!......Ever thought of doing an extensive Mega man episode, reviewing all Mega Man games for all consoles? If it exists please point me there :)
GameSack great episode guys. i always look foreword to what you will review next. i wish that you included the Fatal Fury games from this episode so i can compare them with the NeoGeo ones. that reminds me, when will you do an exclusive NeoGeo episode? you should think about doing something similar to that and review every system out there. it would make one hell of an episode. keep up the good work guys. and thanks for making YouTube more awesome.
GameSack Please tell me where you picked up that Mario shirt.
GameSack Cant believe you havent mentioned ChoRenSha 68k
GameSack this was a great video, Ive seen these and other similar japanese only PCs mentioned in other videos and reviews but nothing really indepth that gives me a good feel as to what the system was like before this. Also both the review of The Cockpit and that final bonus like scene had me laughing so hard I was crying.
GameSack This video was Ok, for the most part.
GameSack I was wondering if you guys could do an episode about graphically impressive games? I really would like to see what skilled programmers managed to pull of.
GameSack Music at 7:12 AMAZING
GameSack You gotta love that dualtower design. Very sexy.I love me a good mech game, so a few of these look right up my alley.
GameSack I thought Id heard of every system out there and you guys pull this one out! Admit it guys you just made this up to fool smart asses like me who think weve seen it all! Awesome system and great video keep it up guys!
GameSack The mecha in Mad Stalker totally looks like a Kampfer from Gundam: 0080.
GameSack Holy shit, you guys, what a great overview of the X68K! Thanks for the entertaining and informative video!
GameSack you guys did a great job reviewing this system!!!
GameSack Love these documentaries! Keep them coming!
GameSack When i was young, very young, i remember playing a SHMUP on the PS1It was basic, going left to right, but everything looked like mechanical junk and literally gigantic enemies that were like chunks of metal flew at you. I have never ever seen any footage of the game since nor do i remember the name of it. If anyone here knows, PLEASE tell me!! Its been driving me crazy all my lifeIts almost as if a dreamt the game!
GameSack Super mario Special is on the sharp x68000 i think
GameSack Salamander  life force?
GameSack My heart sank a little when that large floppy disk was folded to fit in the X68030, is that a bad thing?
GameSack I love how big and intricate the game boxes are.
GameSack Is You need some practice more or less annoying than Where did you learn to fly?. That Star Wars game looks awesome though.
GameSack You should cover the amiga and atari st. Great games by comapnies like psygnosis. Maybe lump amiga and cd32 together.
GameSack Excellent Video Guys :) Got yourselves a new subscriber.
GameSack How about the Amiga 500? Or an episode devoted to the Turrican series!
GameSack Id buy one, but I dont know, its pretty expensive.
GameSack Your videos are simply awesome! This is the best video ive seen regarding the X68000. I was wondering though, do you actually own all the X68000 systems that were shown in this video, or were they just on loan? And Thank You for making the best game show on youtube. I hope it continues on for many years!
GameSack Amazing episode. I wouldve never known about the Sharp X (with echo for emphasis) 68000 if it wasnt for you guys, so thank you!
GameSack Well, the Capcom ports are near arcade since, aside from developing their earlier arcade games on Moto 68000 machines, the CPS1 and 2 arcade cabinets ran on max out versions of essentially what went into the X68000 at 10 and 16MHz respectively.
GameSack All gamesacks reviews are great but the Sharp x68000 is the best review you guys ever done in my opinion.
GameSack No over 9000 joke? Okay.BTW episode 100 is coming do you have any plans or something like that.
GameSack Lukemorse1 has like 3 of the x68000 that he salvaged i think
GameSack Great job, thank you.
GameSack I laughed way too hard when Joe got his Snatcher back :)
GameSack how about the FMTOWNS?By the way.... great video as always
GameSack turn that jerk off was probably not the best choice of words, tobias.
GameSack This is the best presentation of X68000 ive seen on Youtube.Well done guys!The system was expensive back then because it was quite advanced for its time and its expensive now because its relatively rare and many of its extra components and modules are really hard to find.So, you better off finding a good emulator and some disk images if you want to experience the software firsthand.Yeah, i know its not the real thing, but you have to wonder if its really worth it to pay good money for vintage hardware.
GameSack Awww I really want to play Etoile Princesse
GameSack I wonder who bought this console.
GameSack So many shoot em ups!I wish gamers in the West loved shmups as much as the Japanese do.
GameSack neat system but not worth blowing 200
GameSack What X68000 game is the music used in the beginning of the video from?
GameSack Im dead serious when I say The Cockpit looks realistic as fuck.
GameSack About 80 shooter, 20 everything else.Can you say PlayStation?
GameSack But fido dido was released... i played it...
GameSack Please do Nightmare Busters for the snes.
GameSack Mr. Bloopy Jelly Boy brought Puty Squad to my mind for some reason.
GameSack I didnt think that death valley rally was that bad. A bit tedious in terms of platforming but was still enoyable
GameSack Propeller Arena for the Dreamcast is very good.
GameSack Sweet Fugazi TShirt Dave!!!
GameSack 18:30  New tab, theisozone.com, looking for Toe Jam and Earl 3
GameSack Where is Good Luck Charlie Brown for Atari 2600?anyway, eggcellent work guys!
GameSack Half Life 1 was always released... In fact, the best mod, SSH WTF mod uses this.
GameSack That Jellyboysmartball thing remind me of Mr. Gimmick by Sunsoft for the NES for some reason. Might be getting it as I loved Gimmick.
GameSack Have you tried Desert Demolition, Dave? its a pretty good coyoteroad runner game IMO. Not to mention also good Sheep Raider for PS1
GameSack Who have rom of Jelly Boy 2 ? :3
GameSack am i the only one who heard the music around 4:40 and thought it sounded like weird als dare to be stupid?
GameSack I love your guys videos. Nice, clean and simple. No need for overthetop graphics, screaming, yelling or unneeded profanity. I love getting right down to the games and giving the info I want. Keep up the good work.
GameSack marios wacky world and sonic extreme
GameSack Oh my god, Dave in a Fugazi shirt 3  3
GameSack marios wacky worlds of course!
GameSack If you enter the wrong password it tells you to be different I dont wanna be different! XD
GameSack LOL good to know a few people still remember the Richard Gere Gerbil legend.
GameSack Joe does looks like a Wookiee but less hairy.
GameSack Can you do digitized games plz
GameSack Cant believe you forgot Propeller Arena on the Dreamcast... :(
GameSack If I remember correctly, Major Damage was supposed to be a Contra parody, wasnt it?
GameSack Watch this  Capcom should use THIS old prototype for a new IP! :PGAME SACK: Unreleased Games: http:youtu.beLpV2Y32BU?t15m32sCool video btw
GameSack Damn that Steven Seagull game was just horrible! Thanks for sharing it!Fav. part was the Halflife on Dreamcast dev kit, freakin amazing
GameSack new to this channel and have to say wow .. great work guys and please can you do another one of theses
GameSack Fido Dido also at some brief points did the station breaks for Saturday morning cartoons here in the States...I think it was ABC in the late 80s early 90s??
GameSack How dare you make a video about unreleased games without talking about Eon Man: Time Diver and Star Fox 2?
GameSack At 13:15 theres an awesome remix of a music from alter A.I.L.A, that I cant find anywhere on the internet. Where did you find it ? I love this music and this remix sounds so cool, id like to hear the full version :)
GameSack The Jim Power music sounds like Amiga music. 3
GameSack Joe and Dave  pleeeeeeease do an episode on Resident Evil! Like, you could do an episode on RE 1, then RE 2, then RE 3, code veronica, REmake gamecube and zero(but please dont talk much about 5 and 6)!! And maybe Silent Hill!! I want to hear your take on these classics!! Awesome show keep up the great work!
GameSack Everyone who disliked this, be different!
GameSack I may not necessarily give a carp about most of the games shown here but, it was still entertaining overall. It is nice to see what kind of games get flushed down the wrapper over the years. So in the end Thank You Game Sack.
GameSack Mr Nutz Hopping mad was released for the Amiga
GameSack what about Dinosaur Planet for the N64?
GameSack Tim Follin music can save any game.
GameSack May I suggest a little gem called Secret Ties for the NESInteresting gameplay style with a soundtrack thats really good
GameSack i fuckin love you pimps
GameSack Mr Nutz 2 actually looks really ugly in the graphics department, the original was all lush and dreamlike, the second one seems to consist mostly of boring geometric shapes and primary colors, Mr Nutz own graphic looks less detailed too, and that map just looks awful.
GameSack Dude whats the name of the background music playing before reviewing the first game ???
GameSack Changing Market Conditions. Wait... What?! I smell bull.
GameSack I just about lost it when Joe mentioned Steven Segal being the final solution!
GameSack What about Propeller Arena on the Dreamcast? The game was 100 ready, and its disc image is easy to find on the net. Oh, and graphics and gameplay wise, the game is pretty good. Last but not least, it was made by Yu Suzuki.
GameSack How do you record game music to your iPod?
GameSack Nuts on your sundae, nuts on your chin. Classic!
GameSack Project Offset and starcraft ghost
GameSack What bout Babys Day Out for the Genesis?
GameSack jim powers background makes me dizzy.
GameSack I do have Half Life for the Dreamcast, but I didnt know you can both use the keyboard and mouse!
GameSack RESQ was released in Amiga computers, and Fido Dido in Mega Drive (at least in Europe).By the way Mega Drive sound was not bad compared to SNES, the problem was the innability of the western composers to make good music for Mega Drive, you only have to play Sonic 3, Shinobi , or SOR 2 to shit bricks.
GameSack 19:30 thats the water sound effect in roller coaster tycoon 2!
GameSack I think ResQ was on the Sega Channel only
GameSack Avatar the last air bender on the hyper scan.
GameSack Nice Fugazi shirt, love the show.
GameSack Gradius III music in the first 55 seconds :)
GameSack Thanks for making this episode, guys. I appreciate what you do to put these episodes out to us. Pretty interesting topic that not a lot of gaming communities talk about.
GameSack Earthbound(nes) also known as Eathbound Zero due to the second game being released on the SNES under that same title
GameSack You should cover Super Mario World 2
GameSack was fiddo dido not on sega channel once? I sware I played that pile of crud before
GameSack Oh man, I love how you say you play as different characters in Star Trek 5. I couldnt tell the difference. I guess the cut scenes tell you?
GameSack Great video, but, I am surprised that Bio Force Ape wasnt featured since its probably the most legendary unreleased game of all time (and one of the better ones too!)
GameSack Heres a suggestion: Space Fantasy Zone for the PCEngine CD.Its Space Harrier, but with many elements from Fantasy Zone. It would have tied the two series closer together.
GameSack final option.. segal!!! haahahaahahah
GameSack lmfao Be Different. Thanks for the great episode guys
GameSack 6:36 Is that Mitt Romney?
GameSack Im looking for a game i play at 90s.. but i dont remember the name.. is a vertical shooting game.. you drive a kind of red tricycle.. you can shoot and jump.. and i remeber the first stage you need to jump some platforms or you fall into the lava... the tricycle shot some red balls ... i dont remember but looks like you can fly or go at the ground.. i sorry for my bad english.. i looking for this like a crazy maniac and i cant stop until i find this game cause i lose alot of coins to this shit :D
GameSack if there are more unreleased games. I highly suggest doing a sequel to this video.
GameSack would love to see the Sonic SATAM game
GameSack Castlevania for the 32x and the dreamcast
GameSack Hey Guys, as recommended by you to state some unreleased games worth mentioning I thought I would, how about Playstation, you missed the entire console. So biased, please make some dedicated shows to Playstation (especially PS1) or at least include them in your topics of discussion. Thanks, good video though guys as usual. :)
GameSack LOOK at the Mr. Nuttz level design. i see stuff from sonic 1,2, AND 3!!!!look close at the floors and walls, background, ect. IDENTICAL
GameSack i thought the pics of Steven Segal looked good in EGM at the time but seeing the game in motion I now see that it sucks.
GameSack Do you guys ever use your video game powers to get laid?
GameSack Dreamcasts Propeller Arena :)
GameSack The sega dreamcast is 10 times better than the xbox.
GameSack Most of this games are better than the actual games!
GameSack does anyone know where I can find that version of Gradius 3 in the wind that plays in the background during the first section of the episode?
GameSack super marios wacky worlds
GameSack You guys are so fuking uglyweird looking. Your background, and video presentation is like some fucking 80s bullshit, and your voiceover guy sounds like he is retarded. All in All though I tend to quite like your show! Keep up the good work!
GameSack You guys are hilarious.
GameSack There is a bill that was introduced to congress last week that will effect this show  others like it. You guys remember SOPA? Well, its back  we have to spread the word  contact your U.S. representatives. The bill is called the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2014. It is a fast track bill that would allow quick passage of the TransPacific Partnership. TPP is NAFTA on steroids  has SOPA tucked in its back pocket. So if we defeat the Bipartisan bill TPP will most likely fail. I beg everyone to look into it  contact your representatives. I do not think I understate it when I say this could be the most thing we do in our lifetime.
GameSack WWF BACKLASH FOR N 64

GameSack WELCOME TO THE THUNDER DOME, THE ARMORED PLAYGROUND OF DEATH!!!
GameSack Whats the all your base are belong to us from?
GameSack Fucking hashtags on youtube? Seriously?
GameSack Smosh Games A.K.A. Sohiki and Lasercorn play some random games that we dont give a fuck about.
GameSack At least one grammar Nazi had to take the field: Steal an enemies duffel bag is incorrect. It should be Steal an enemys duffel bag or steal the enemies duffel bag. Including the word an implies one enemy and so you wouldnt take the plural of enemy and make that possessive. Using the word the could insinuate multiple enemies owning one duffel bag thereby, making it correct. THE MORE YOU KNOW!
GameSack try to get 5 stars in the next episode. Get in as much trouble as you can.
GameSack THE title sounds weird
GameSack AL UR BACE AR BELONG TO US
GameSack all your base are belong to us! XD

GameSack I LIKE SMOSH GAMES WEN THEY PLAY GTA5
GameSack DO THE HUNGER GAMES IN GTA V PLZ!!!!!!
GameSack You guys need to step up your game to get on par with other gamers on YouTube... you dont even look, sound or seem like youre enjoying what youre playing. Also, relying on random cut aways for comedy is not that effective. I think Smosh might want to start looking for some more entertaining commentators soon. Just my opinion.
GameSack Enjoy GTA V?! Then check out our channel and help us grow!!

GameSack 100x better to have psp with emulator
GameSack Its great but you did nail all the minor issues i have with it as well
GameSack Now my retro duo portable is sitting in my box just getting dust. So not worth it
GameSack Yo GameSack I would really love for you to answer this question because i may purcahse a retrogen for the snes. Does it capture that good genesis sound when you use it or no?
GameSack Does anybody know where I could get THAT AWESOME Samus Aran Metroid shirt?
GameSack gets on bus with retro towerbus driver:hey!you have to pay for two passengers!:P
GameSack I dont care about the Duo Portable, but I will try to get a Mega DriveSuper Nintendo adapter.
GameSack Hehehe nice thing you got there xD
GameSack 11:06 Shinobi III  SNES???? i think joe was very obsesced using the RetroGen adapter hehe!
GameSack Thank you, your videos always make me smile.
GameSack lol. Wow. The adapters are awesome.
GameSack Glad your channel is doing well. You guys deserve it.
GameSack The pastel color scheme makes it seem cheap.
GameSack Do they make that GBA adapter for a PAL Super Nintendo? Ive been dying to play GBA games on the big screen for years!
GameSack Why dont you guys do any more retro portable episodes?
GameSack looks pretty awesome, i might get it eventhough im a sega guy.
GameSack Came from gamester81 video. I liked both reviews about retro duo 2. Thanks gamesack.
GameSack Radical Pyscho Machines
GameSack This was worth it to see the tower of genesis addons.
GameSack Joe and Dave, u are my dudes. I love your vids. It helps me get the past the drudgery of work. Great review. Keep doing what u guys do
GameSack Id buy this if I had lot of cartridges lying around....unfortunately I dont
GameSack As far as I know the reason the GBA and Genesis adapters have their own AV outs is that all the actual guts is in the adapter. It doesnt use any of the SNES hardware to output the video. It merely draws power from it. I agree its clunky but probably the easiest way of doing emulation on a SNES, especially when you consider the SNES is 16bit and the GBA is 32bit.
GameSack Where get the samus tshirt ?
GameSack this is so sick I wish I had one of these then I could play SNES games since I dont own the system myself
GameSack This was a really good video. Thanks for uploading.
GameSack Game Sack  The Retro Duo Portable: http:youtu.be8LoRSZ2OWVw
GameSack Hehe! Funny episode. I especially liked the part where Joe had that tower of extensions.
GameSack It would be better with a 6button layout. It would be more comfortable to use and 42 sucks for fighting and Genesis games (except racing).
GameSack Joe and Dave, you are both awesome. Thanks for another fun video!
GameSack The PSP is able to this too but without huge cartridgesThere are also other handhelds that take Roms too and are way more convenientAlso android smart phones have emulators too, and they have controllers built for android
GameSack I dont get it. Its emulation anyway so why not just use an android device...?
GameSack Have you guys played on the Blaze Sega Megadrive portable games console? If so whats your take on it?
GameSack I really like the top gear music a lot nice touch guys.
GameSack This is one of those things that wouldve been awesome back in the day, but now... meh.
GameSack Theres another Adapter, the Retro Port Adapter. It can replace the Retro Port Adapter the system comes with,
GameSack Whats the music playing at 7:39? Its so familiar but I cant remember its name.
GameSack Im excited for that GBA adapter. Thanks for the review!
GameSack Its like holding the balls of godbest line ever!!
GameSack Does anyone know what nintendo 64 flash cart they have plugged in at 9:41? It doesnt look like the Everdrive 64, so what could it be?!
GameSack But does it run super mario rpg?
GameSack Does it work with the Sega CD? lol.
GameSack Great work Guys. I love your channel. brings back memories
GameSack what no new years special?
GameSack this one looks so awesome !! i bought 2 different supaboy and they both broke within the first two days
GameSack How did the leaning tower of swaying power no snap anything I kept going OO as it kept getting bigger and taller and swayed further!
GameSack I love the GBA adapter and that you can use super gameboy , so redundant!
GameSack I think you have to use the AV cable of the Retro Duo because the SNES is used as a power source and the adapter is doing all the job because the GBA has a different architecture and processor than the SNES.Can someone confirm?
GameSack I didnt know that they made a Lego handheld console.LOL I still want one.I am surprised that they have not made a handheld that can play Xbox,PS 1,2 or even the Sega cd.That would be awesome! My two favorites are Sega Nomad and Turbo Express I can play all my favorite games on the go that I already own.
GameSack i will recommend the Supa Boy fro Hyperkin. it is almost the same.
GameSack Ive always had problems playing Kirby games as well as super Mario rpg on these portable systems because of the addition of a special chip. Hopefully they fixed this?
GameSack can you compare it to the Supaboy?
GameSack What is the name of that SFC game they play on the retro duo portable? I own one and I am looking for some sfc games to play on it!
GameSack I hope there will be a better version of this one but next time have the triggers on the back of the console
GameSack awesome video!The portable Sonic Tower was funny.Also,really amazing to see Genesis games running on SNES.
GameSack Probably the funniest video you guys have done yet, and was informative. All packed into 12 minutes!
GameSack I bought one spur of the moment and I have to say I was really impressed! you guys brought up some real solid points and you will really get some bang for your buck with all the adapters at a relatively low price. Plus who doesnt want to play the original versions of ffII and ffII on the go
GameSack Are you guys planning on looking at the Supaboy soon? It seems that in terms of SNES games on the go, it seems that most people go for the Supaboy.
GameSack Hi Guys! I have enjoyed watching your show, and I love video game. I have played a lot of games and I have now a PlayStation 2 and I think that I would switch to a Sega Saturn console or a Super Nintendo Entertainment System console. I take this opportunity to wish you a happy New year 2014, and see you in the next year.
GameSack I love you guys so much! The best show ever. Happy old year.
GameSack Would you be able to play Kabuki Quantum Fighter on the Retro Duo Portable?
GameSack I laughed my ass off at 4.45
GameSack Haha game stack, not game sack )
GameSack One of your best reviews, thx guys!
GameSack On the subject of SNES compatibility, how does Super Ghouls and Ghosts look? On other RetroBit consoles Ive owned, the 2nd boss is invisible! The same problem happens with another Capcom game, Magical Quest starring Mickey Mouse
GameSack When youre playing via emulation Id rather just have something you didnt have to plug the original cartridges into.Youre not getting a purist true experience anyway so it might as well be a comfortable one.
GameSack At 4:45 I couldnt stop laughing.This portable is now 3ft tall! Even the NES adapter is a bit much.
GameSack Very very good thorough review unlike ALPHAOMEGASIN Sorry Bro.
GameSack As much as I would love to play those classic games again, I dont really have an interest in this portable only because I dont feel comfortable with a miniature leaning Tower of Piza.
GameSack Balls of god, hahaha so glad I found this video!
GameSack god that sega fan boy is a total douche he drives me nuts
GameSack ... as comfortable as holding the balls of godI love you guys, never stop making these vids.
GameSack Ive been subscribed to Gamesack for a long time and I generally find this show quite entertaining... But this is probably my favorite episode so far, especially the bit at 4:50 :)
GameSack I think i will use everdrive...
GameSack Rastan?! I own the original arcade cabinet (and it works)!
GameSack you guys are painfully unfunny. my honest advice is stick to doing straight reviews, honestly I wouldnt recommend selfdeprecating comments like calling your own videos moderately entertaining. If you dont care about the subject matter, why should viewers care. Better to be honest nerds, than nerds who try to be smartass but just fail and end up looking dorks and douches.
GameSack Holding the balls of God LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!
GameSack Coolest guy in the block  4:22. I agree that the Retro Duo Portable itself isnt too thrilling, but the adapters seem great and its nice that you can get extra controllers and use them on your SNES, because getting extra controllers for old consoles is kind of problematic nowadays, at least for me it seems to be the case.
GameSack who the hell would get this over a modded psp
GameSack Easy as holding the balls of god ..
GameSack Is it compatible with flash carts?
GameSack hahahahah!! daves face when joe says hes the best of the duo made my day
GameSack The zyrinx 32x demos rather impressive. Whip Ass Gaming: Zyrinx 32X Demo Tape
GameSack Dang it Joe and Dave, where in the world is my Fan Translation Episode?!?!But in all seriousness, this is an awesome episode.
GameSack The music on the title screen of Super Mario Odyssey is a remix of Chronologie 4 by Jean Michel Jarre... I know because its one of my favorite pieces of music in history :)
GameSack Of all the game sacks in the world, youre the game sackiest.Not sure if you guys have mentioned it before, but have you ever played Sweet Home on the Famicom? Its totally awesome. I only ask because theres a repro cart available now.
GameSack 13:45 Am I the only one who noticed the art style looks like another certain indie with trees, odd screenscrolling, and small protagonist?
GameSack the music on that super mario odyssey level is just petal meadows from paper mario 2
GameSack Does he even know what bad apple is about?
GameSack I know you guys dont cover PC game, but as Dave is a Nintendo fan, he should check Dangeros Dave in Copyright Infringement from ID Software for Nintendo. (and it history of why it was impressive) )watch?vcj4HJkeQSg0
GameSack Amazing episode! I didnt even realize that Episodes II and III of Shining Force III were translated. There are so many awesome games covered in this episode. Thank You!
GameSack Great ending, that splash screen had me laughing pretty hard.
GameSack What was the song that played at the credits of this episode?
GameSack European home consoles only had one button, so up would have been jump on them too for Rick Dangerous.
GameSack Star Ocean: First Departure is far superior to the Super Famicom version. Its improved in every way.
GameSack Touhou in my GameSack? life 1 step closer to complete!
GameSack Great episode! Daves shirt is AWESOME!!! Any chance on you guys doing a Phantasy Star or Soul Series episode?
GameSack Oh Mummy! was originally an Amstrad 464 release, back in 1984. I used to own an amstrad 464 at one point and I also had this game. This genisisMegadrive remake is pretty impressive and stays true to the original, even the music is the same.
GameSack You should try sonic boom, it has some nice tunes.
GameSack Where did u fing that turbografx 16 microsd card adapter?.
GameSack If you like pokmon you MUST play Pokmon Light pPatinum, a beatiful hack! Another must play is pokmon Glazed, but this is still in development...
GameSack How does one get the homebrew 32X games...???
GameSack That Seiken Densetsu 3 is also 3 person multiplayer. But a great SNES translation hack is Tales of Phantasia which is still far better than the GBA Remake. Only thing the GBA Remake has is an extra character and nuances from Tales of Symphonia.
GameSack 48 mega power? as in the star ocean cartridge has 48mb?
GameSack You gotta be on RetrowareTV.
GameSack OMG, I know that MOD file in that 32X game... its Guitar Slinger! I remember making a little song of my own with the samples in it! Joe, if you like MOD files, you should look at my channel... I write all of my music in IT format.
GameSack Homebrew games  Game Sack  Great Review, nice video.
GameSack I hope you guys dont stop doing these for a long time.
GameSack On some of your game footage theres a really high pitched sound that hurts my sensitive ears for some reason. Its a bit annoying, and I guess theres nothing to do about it.
GameSack 22:55 The same game already existing on GBA  Yggdra Union  Well Never Fight Alone
GameSack the song from Super Mario Odyssey is actualy Jean Michel Jarre  Chronologie 4
GameSack The English fan translation of hideo kojimas policenauts on ps1 is a must play particularly if you enjoyed snatcher
GameSack Really not mentioning the mother translations?
GameSack Battle Kid is inspired by I Wanna Be The Guy, a satirical super difficult platformer for the PC from 2009. If you didnt hear about IWBTG then shame on you!
GameSack Oh mummy came out for the zx spectrum
GameSack Please ditch the f1.2 lens
GameSack i really like pokemon light platinum
GameSack 14:02  Theme song from Cheetahmen!
GameSack i wonder how much MEGA POWER the Gamesack homebrew has..
GameSack I managed to pick up a reproduction copy of Secret of Mana 2 for a decent price. Looking forward to playing when I have some free time.
GameSack The best game is rick dangerous. I dont know if the gameplay is the same but if it is like the commodore amiga version, is definitely the best game. You should try it on the amiga and try rick dangerous 2.
GameSack Hoping to talk about Street of Rage remake.
GameSack I know you probably got this a thousand times, but there was a very good hack of MotherEarthbound 3 you should check out sometime.
GameSack Digger Chan is just a ripoff of Mr. Driller.
GameSack WHAT NO MOTHER 3 AKA EARTHBOUND 2 REALLY LOL
GameSack I am trying to figure out what program i need and how to add orginal xbox games i have many ISO xbox games
GameSack so cool guys you should definitely make more of these episodes I recommend the dreamcast for homebrew as it has a thriving community and plenty of awesome games made by that community.
GameSack Amazing episode. Looking forward to more of this type.
GameSack There is a Kriss Kross game on Sega CD? Wow, I lucked out by not knowing that until now.
GameSack How about Ultimate Mortal Kombat Trilogy the hack version of UMK3 on the Genesis.
GameSack Nice to see a fully translated version of rondo of blood now if someone could do the same for the japanese saturn version of SotN.
GameSack Excellent episode as usually, but I have a question about playing some of these English translated hacks especially for my PCEngine CD. How would you go about playing them on the actual hardware? Ive read that playing burnt CD games on the ancient PCEngine CDROM is bad for the lens. I also own a Everdrive with a SD memory card, do you load them using that? What about CD based games like YS and Dracula X Rondo? Im worried I might damage my hardware.
GameSack One of the greatest shows on Earth. Yes.
GameSack We need a Time Gal port to the Super NES!
GameSack my favorite fantranslation of any game is still Mother 3although i do have to admit i was amused by the Finnish translation ofChrono Trigger haha..
GameSack In terms of hacks, Im surprised you didnt cover the SSBB mod Project M.
GameSack Speaking of Bad Apple, I wonder if Joes played Touhou much.
GameSack I laughed at how Tonguemans Logic is ripping off the Gunstar Heroes spinning logo xD
GameSack Tonguemans Logic  Picross. Mario even got one on the Game Boy.
GameSack I wish yall made videos more often (once a week)! This is one of my favorite channels!!
GameSack Try out challenging lolo (a hack of the adventures of lolo) if you like truly brain wrecking puzzles.
GameSack Game Under instead of Game Over? I dont get it
GameSack Im not having great luck tracking down the Castlevania 2 rom hack mentioned that was released by Biscuit. Any pointers?
GameSack Even if you dont like Sonic hacks you should at least acknowledge Sonic ERaZor, Sonic 3 Complete and Dr. Robotniks Creature Capture. At least you mentioned Sonic Classic Heroes.
GameSack Theres hacks of Sonic 2 and Sonic CD where theyve added the homing attack. Its a ton of fun annihilating everything. But it does take skill, you cant just spam it, otherwise you could launch yourself into spikes, pits, or enemies.
GameSack Oh Mummy is the first game I ever played back in 1985 on the Spectrum. Fond memories of my dad plugging the whole thing together and showing me how to play it.
GameSack whats the song in the beginning of the video? sound so familiar I know Ive heard it before
GameSack What music are you using using when you are plugging the flash cart into the console in the beginning?
GameSack the music in the mario homebrew around 7:00 is the petalburg theme from paper mario the thousand year door, thats why it sounds authentic.
GameSack What the hell, how can you not like sonic the hedgehog. You even said sonic was better than Mario!
GameSack Man, where do you guys get all your amazing shirts? I really want a Dreamcast shirt! :D
GameSack I just got an NES Powerpak to play a lot of these, good to see theres a few more out there. Id definitely recommend the Final Fantasy VII hack on NES. It started as an unlicensed pirate, then hackers translated it and made it a whole lot more playable.
GameSack This was a most excellent episode!
GameSack heres two (2) great super Nintendo hacks the legend of zelda parallel worlds: you can get reproduction carts of this game and chrono trigger crimson echoes: the reproduction cart of this game nerver came out though
GameSack Time for you guys to eat your words when you said Wolfteam makes bad games... play Tales of Phantasia for the SNES.
GameSack Herwes a few that I love, super Mario 64 the lost stars, megabman x3(fully playable zero from start to finish) and a CRAP load of super Mario world hacks.
GameSack LangrisserWarsong? Yes, that demands assume love. I suggest you also check out the translation of Der Langrisser for the family.
GameSack at least Angry Birds on the Genesis takes advantage of the Genesis sound chip
GameSack Hey Rusted Logic: FINISH SUPER MARIO ODYSSEY!
GameSack 17:45 what is the name of the game?
GameSack The Dragon Quest games on Super Famicom! The best Dragon Quest games are the Japanonly ones on the Super Famicom, and there are amazing fantranslation hacks out there! I personally like them a lot more than Final Fantasy (Dont kill me) Also TOUHOU!!! (You gotta play Touhou 4 Lotus Land Story on the NEC PC9801 to listen to the original, and in my opinion best, version of Bad Apple!)
GameSack Jajajajaa Mojon Twins means, means Dung Twins.Mojn is the word for dung in spanish.
GameSack You guys ought to track down a game called The Legend of Zelda: Parallel Worlds. Its a game hack made from A Link to the Past. It has a good story and worth checking out. To me, it seems the save function doesnt work, so youre better off using the emulators saveload state functions to save your game and progress through the game.
GameSack Mega Man 2! One of my favorites when I was a kid
GameSack Hahaha is that Persona 4 Arena music playing in the background?
GameSack Butt Babies and Tranny Trans makes me want to vomit its so disgusting.
GameSack Wait... A Sega Fanboy who was never into Sonic?????? :P Jeez.
GameSack gabs das im RIP? wenn ja, hab ichs wohl irgendwie verpasst...

GameSack I wish it was more.. red?
GameSack Vendor food bag. Merry christmas Tarkleigh!
GameSack Those look like hands. Not presents.
GameSack Wow. Such bag. I must have it!
GameSack Can this be used with BoR? If not can you make these attachments usable with BoR? My main has this helm and it saddens me I cannot use a cosmetic on my chest or a skin transfer on my chest piece.
GameSack Looks cool. Give it us for free, its christmas! :D
GameSack Make it work with BoR please? Back attachements are useless for me atm..
GameSack H O W M U C H F O R T H I S

GameSack Did I really just watch this crap for 20 minutes?
GameSack Sack a fool, hire a fool.. Ah well. Can we break that like button? GameDevTycoon
GameSack U deserve way more subs
GameSack Great vid TVM. Making good games now. Keep em up.
GameSack Cant you do two episodes everyday or make the videos longer please I would love that
GameSack I am no longer reading the comments on this video. Theyre of very poor quality. Mainly just accusing us of forgetting games. Guys, we cant read your minds and include exactly the games YOU want each episode. Its very frustrating to read comments saying You forgot  or How could you not include ? or No ? Im so disappointed!. Were definitely fine with people suggesting games for future installments or suggesting we try certain games (which a lot of you have been doing, thanks!) but the whining is not cool at all. So I probably wont be reading nor responding to any more comments on this particular video. I can now understand why AVGN doesnt comment on his videos any more. Well continue to include the games we want to include. Apologies to all of the really cool fans (which are most of you) for this. We really like you guys! Feel free to talk to us on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. :)
GameSack OK I CANT RESIST! Im finding myself reading comments despite declaring that I wasnt going to. Im a filthy liar. I just care too much about what you guys say, even the thoughtless comments. :)
GameSack To be honest, Gameday 98 revolutionized football games.
GameSack Id love to see a vid about the other sports games. Like nba jam and the mutant league stuff. I hear there were nba jam variants and even an arcade. Sounds awesome!
GameSack No sports game list is complete without NHL 94, or Punchout, or any Mario sports games.
GameSack Oh you guys! Its almost brave, these days to talk about sports games in the gaming community, but this is mother fin GAME SACK! This is gonna be awesome!Oh, and take the negative comments with a grain of salt, some people just cant help but talk crap and think too hard about reasons why something is lame or that something was forgotten.I know that you guys only have your own games to work with, so that can be somewhat limiting in some ways, but gosh darnit, you guys make the best of what you have, Ill say that.Thanks for uploading as always, your videos are just about the only thing I have to look forward to on Sundays.Much love from Canada!
GameSack I remember playing Hole In One Golf. I rented it all the time instead of a game called Secret of Mana at BlockBuster. If only I could put that game on my nostalgia list.
GameSack its soccer in Australia too!
GameSack Kinda missing NBA Jam and NHL Hitz 2003, those are great arcade sports games.Also I quite enjoy racing sports games like the F1, Moto GP and DTM Race Driver series.
GameSack You should try Super Baseball 2020, pretty fun game. Virtua Tennis games are pretty good too.
GameSack The ending was pure gold. I am the kinda guy who likes sports games with TWISTS. Games like Mutant league hockey and football,Super High Impact,Nba jam,Baseball simulator 1,000 (and its SNES counterpart),Arch rivals and pigskin footbrawl! Seriously though technical sports games are crap and full of boredom. the ONLY ones I enjoyed were tecmo bowl and sighs while putting up shield for protection Bases loaded 2 : The second season. Another great episode guys. Keep up the awesome work!
GameSack I now sports gams are had to pay
GameSack Man those pines trees smell like butt.
GameSack Tecmo Bowl Bo Jackson enough said
GameSack i think tecmo bowl or super tecmo bowl is everyones favorite football game of all time even madden fanboys would say it is theyre all time favorite aswell
GameSack Id think it be a good idea to do a parody sports game episode using games Im surprised you didnt use like Mutant League Football, Ring King, and goofy games like that.
GameSack My favorite is probably Neo Turf Masters.ON THE GREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN!
GameSack If you do another sports video, include nhl 94
GameSack I think Dave needs to get checked out for tinnitus.
GameSack Wow, I cant believe you made an episode that was about sports AND was entertaining.10 John Maddens out of 10 guys.
GameSack please do another sports game dudez and get some Tony Hawk in there...
GameSack The best retro game videos on the web. High production quality and always has me entertained from beginning to end. Keepem coming!!!
GameSack lakers vs celtics on genesis, the players are marked by the color of their sneakers
GameSack You guys are legit :D
GameSack suggestion: what about puzzle games or platformers next?
GameSack Ive always liked FIFAgames and some NHL ones too BUT my absolute favorite sports game ever must be NBA Street series (from 1 to v3)
GameSack People need to stop complaining that you guys didnt include a certain games in your episode. Guys, I can imagine that making an episode for Game Sack could be hard, because of how high quality their videos are. Just appreciate all the work Joe and Dave did to make this video for you guys, seriously!
GameSack Hey well guessed, I nearly didnt watch it, but enjoyed it in the end.
GameSack Include nba jam, on several consoles, and nfl blitz, on ps1 and n64, in the next sports episode. I dont like sports very much but those games are good.
GameSack I kept watching and waiting for Tecmo Bowl to pop out. Many... MANY hours playing that game with pals o mine. And guess what? The Broncos was my team! Good defensive players. Not that I took offense that Dave stole my team! (Damn you!)The only sports games I ever got into was Tecmo Bowl and some Golf games. But hey, no deal breakers though. NBA Jam sessions with old buds a few times. I enjoy watching you guyzes videos. Ive noticed a few nice games I never heard of before and tried them. Keep all the videos game footage rollin out. Cheers!
GameSack Expect this to be your guys lowestviewed video haha
GameSack Oh man...Tommy Lasorda baseball was the best...

GameSack Make a Gaming on Christmas episode!
GameSack Great video. Thank you guys for putting so much effort in showing us your collection. You are awesome!
GameSack I like that you gave plenty of time to the lesserknown titles. Id also have covered Sensible Soccer on the SNES!
GameSack Ok guys I know you dont want to hear it but play MVP Baseball 05 for ps2. Its great. Dont put it in an episode just play for your own good. Play the hitting minigame guarantee youll have a ultra good time and you dont have to be a sports game fan to enjoy it
GameSack No mention of any NHL games? Thats downright criminal!
GameSack In lakers vs celtics the player you are controlling has black shoes instead of white.
GameSack My favorite NES sports games were Blades of Steel (which lets you play Gradius during intermission), Baseball Stars, and Punch Out. I had NFL Quarterback Club on SNES which was fun, oh and Wayne Gretzky and the NHLPA All Stars.
GameSack For a long period, really the only video games I played were sports games (mostly football). After I played Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, I got back into other genres (always loved the arcade classics though!).
GameSack Hopefully in part 2 you guys do nba jam and nfl blitz , great games.

GameSack You forgot super dodgeball on snes, pc engine, arcade and whateverBut good episode
GameSack Im surprised but not appalled that you never mentioned the Backyard Sports series from Humongous Entertainment. Or NBA Jam for that matter. Other than that no complaints here.
GameSack Only sportgame worth playing is the Punch Out series!
GameSack The Tony Hawk games are my favorite sports games, I have most of them. Also more people need to watch Game Sack!
GameSack All your episodes rock. How come my saturn controller looks different from yours? Keep up the good work.
GameSack Madden 96 has the UFC music theme?
GameSack What about Olympic Gold?? Great review as always!
GameSack Edit: Dont worry, this is a positive comment!Im watching this, and sports bore me most of the time! I just like watching LPs done by people who have interesting things to say.
GameSack Why were all the women in the boxing game stacked? They all look like Dolly Parton!Anyways. I was hoping Dodge Ball games would have made an entry. Those are such funny games.
GameSack it sounded like he said hit by a bitch when the ball hit the batter
GameSack I was always a fan of Mario Strikers but thats probably because I always win
GameSack Jennifer Capriati Tennis is an extremely under the radar game that I have had hours of fun with.
GameSack Not a big sports fan, but I still found the information interesting. Great job Game Sack!
GameSack What? No Mega Man Soccer!?
GameSack I really enjoyed the episode, despite the fact that Ive avoided sports games like the plague after the 16bit era. I had totally forgotten about the early sports games on the Genesis.
GameSack Cant believe you overlooked Super Tecmo Bowl for the NES. Best of the series, Dave!
GameSack Obviously you guys are not sport game fans and that is fine...i get it but to enjoy a game because it is Easy vs More Challenging is like talking to my 12 year old. Hey son why dont you like this game? Because it is too hard and I want to win every time. Well sometimes you need to learn how to beat and strategize, Son. I dont want to...it should be easy. Ha! To each their own but this review was almost pointless because you do not go deep enough to explain (besides graphics and easyness of the game)  like a kid reviewing a game. Where as say Madden(which I agree is an abomination now) didnt just update graphics and add teams but added stats, season long stats, leader boards, etc...the thing most sport fans enjoy. Same as EAs BBall series. It started as a plain lets play 5 on 5 Bball and by the end of the Genesis era you could trade players, create players, track career stats, etc...which for that genre was a BIG deal. But due to the lack of your knowledge you focus on the Silly music in the first game and claim that is the best one. Same thing with the Tecmo series. Yes the first one was fine but so shallow. Tecmo Super Bowl 3 is more complex but it is leaps and bounds better than the original IMHO. I think you guys are better off not even doing this video. Its like a nonRPG player reviewing the 8bit and 16bit consoles in the same time span. Well I didnt like FFIII because it was just too complex and deep. Ill stick with whatever the 1st RPG game was because they wore funny clothes and I could beat it easily.I did enjoy your Recent Japan PC Game console  I forget the name.
GameSack IM IN HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELL
GameSack Hey where are the Neo Geo other sports games? The only one I saw was baseball stars. What about super sidekicks series, golf games football games basketball? I think you guys dont like the Neo Geo a whole lot which is a shame.
GameSack Surprised to see no mention of NFL Blitz in here. That to me was the best arcade style sports game on the N64.
GameSack Here are my favorite Sports games for the following systems:NES  Basewars, Bad News Baseball, Ring King, Mike Tysons PunchOut, Tecmo Bowl, Tecmo World Wrestling,  ProWrestling.Sega Genesis  RBI 93, RBI 94, Evander Holyfields Real Deal Boxing, Greatest Heavyweights, Super High Impact,  Toughman Contest.SNES  Boxing Legends of the Ring, NBA Jam T.E., Foreman For Real, NHL Stanley Cup, NHL 96, Bill Laimbeer Basketball, Megaman Soccer, Champions: World Class Soccer, Super PunchOut, Riddick Bowe Boxing, Chavez,  Chavez 2.PS1  VR Soccer 96, NHL Faceoff 97, NHL 98, NHL 99, NHL 2000, NHL Rock the Rink, Mike Tyson Boxing, Knockout Kings, Knockout Kings 2000, Knockout Kings 2001, Contender, Contender 2, Ready 2 Rumble, Ready 2 Rumble: Round 2, Triple Play 98,  Triple Play 2001.PS2  NHL 2002, NHL 2006, NHL 2007, MVP Baseball 2005, Madden NFL 2004, Madden NFL 2006, Madden NFL 2007, Nascar 2005: Chase for the Cup, Nascar 2006: Total Team Control,  Nascar 2007.
GameSack I thought Winter Heat was an albino porno
GameSack Wassup guys come check out some of my vintage game finds from the sunshine state! !!
GameSack Best Game Sack ending ever. It had me in stitches.
GameSack Not at all a fan of sports games, as much of a sports fan as I am. They try so hard to be realistic they took out the fun. The most fun I had in a sports game: Hot Shots Golf 3, and I cant stand watching real golf, but this game is fun and doesnt take itself seriously.
GameSack mutant league football and hockey! deion Sanders sports talk football!
GameSack ever time on a weekend I think im going to sleep one of game sacks videos appers
GameSack Great video as always. I think you should try international superstar soccer series, there are 2 for the snes and one of these for the genesis, these games have beautiful graphics, great gameplay, and to me its the best soccer series of the 16 bits era, if you play these games i hope you enjoy them.
GameSack You guys skipped NBA Jam..
GameSack SEGA  MUTANT LEAGUE FOOTBALL,,,,,NUFF SAID
GameSack It would be cool if sometime this month you guys could make a holiday special featuring holiday themed Nintendo and Sega titles. I love all of your videos by the way, Easily this is my favorite game review channel. Thanks for all the great work.
GameSack my favorite NFL Football Game of all time isEPSN NFL 2K5
GameSack LMAO I forgot about the Madden ambulance. So funny
GameSack LOL at the skit at the end. You should do a DVD of all the skits. The episodes are good too I guess.
GameSack Over 60,000 views and in a very short time. You have to make more sports episodes now! :D
GameSack al realy fucking good
GameSack Fifa 98 for the N64. Theres a button specifically for fouling people and getting a red card.
GameSack I never play sports games, but I still watched this episode...because of how much I love Game Sack.

GameSack Stormcloaks for the win.....FREEDOM FOR SKYRIM
GameSack The whole game is dragons how could you possibly not know Skyrim is about dragons?!
GameSack i love his reaction to alduin in the beginning
GameSack That is just too random, you might as well put them to play mario party.
GameSack Bandit Keith wrote this articleThen why doesnt it say New Changes to the YuGiOh! Championship Series... IN AMERICA!?
GameSack actually I think (Im not sure) that Americas is a technical term to call North and South America.
GameSack i would hate to be the guy who went X0 in swiss does the draft pulls crap and then loses because heshe pulled bad
GameSack Give it a few months after it happens. Itll revert soon enough.
GameSack WTF. its not skill now. Its lucksac with the player who ends up with getting good cards for their deck and random topdeck duel.
GameSack Yep japanese companies and their ideas yep.
GameSack doesnt konami lose money this way? we all know its all about money for them so...
GameSack It would have been cool if they changed the top 16 to a tag team format. The last team will duel one on one for the championship.
GameSack Now we can get interesting YCS again
GameSack The stupidity of people about this topic is beyond me. Anybody who plays Magic will know how skill based sealed is. This system eliminates all of the bad and unlucky players straight away in top 16.
GameSack Its like draft in MTG.
GameSack what they are doing is also balancing what ppl can use if its all the same pack then u wont see something like drag rulers or spell books when u dont have these good cards so it can work but yah it would suck to not use a deck u have spent a lot of money on
GameSack We already have enough ppl talking about this shit so stop fuckin talking atleast get a better voice pussy ass mother fucker
GameSack I dont totally understand people who keep on saying that only lucky people will now win. From my understanding, up until the top 16, it would be regular play, thus eliminating the bad players. Then in the top 16, its Draft. Its not like sealed play, were you hope to pull the best cards to win. You get your own packs and you get to pick the best one out of them and continue to pass the cards until the deck is basically complete. Its not totally luck guys. Of course, some might still end up with a greater amount of good cards, but it still definitely skill to win.
GameSack I like this idea, it seperates the netdeckers from the people who actually have a logical thought process, who put real time and effort into building a deck. Watch as only 1 or 2 players know how to build a deck and the rest are MAIN ENGINE! STAPLE STAPLE STAPLE.
GameSack Or let YuGiOh have cash prizes.
GameSack Actually the draft process is interesting on the extra link, basically you open a pack, take one card and pass the rest to one dude next ot you while you recive also a pile of remaning cards fthat someone else got, pick one and pass the rest and so on every time the pile you will recive is smaller and smaller till no cards remains and everybody opens the enxt pack. you must pay attention wich cards you choose everytime and have a good guess of what everyone else is going to get from the packs. Its pretty much luck and be smart on pick your cards, but must than anything, luck.
GameSack huehuehueheuheuheuehueheu
GameSack idk why but I found this hilarious.
GameSack When they say the Americas, they are probably talking about North and South America. Silly azneyes
GameSack I want deck profiles when that happens lol sike stupid idea but w.e
GameSack The americas because they are talking about all of north america maybe?
GameSack they should give everyone the same structure deck for the double digit rounds
GameSack But at San Diegos draft one last time I went, it wasnt actually draft but people giving us prebuild decks from Battle Pack cards. I know it saves time, but it was a downer for me. Even with that, they took forever to start.
GameSack http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiAmericas PP The Americas
GameSack I can argue with that. The stacks get passed around, so everyone gets a fair chance since you dont get to keep all the best cards from your pack, just one at a time.
GameSack well i guess i wont be playing at ycs anymore
GameSack maybe they could have a selected amount of cards that will be allowed to use in this draft and then you will have to construct them that way everyone will have acess to the same cards
GameSack ...This is so...stupid, what happens if you pull vanillas, and you have to put them in your deck? You would never be able to win, these decks made straight out of packs would have no synergy...like, this makes absolutely NO sense.
GameSack ...just gonna say konami is the worst company ever
GameSack I heard of yugioh being all about luck but this is just rediculous
GameSack What packs do u get to get
GameSack Good luck using the high priestess or any other ultra rare when its not even playable in draft format, at least do some research before spreading news youre already on the site. and yes Konami is just trying out something new let them jeez worst case scenario they see a problem with the sealed draft packs and revert it back to normal, best case scenario Yugioh gets another tournament format or anything,so what if a below average player makes it through swiss theyre either not below average or will need continued good luck to continuously get amazing cards out of the packs and know how to use them.
GameSack I wouldve made it a side event..
GameSack Maybe if people understood what a draft was. A draft is this, a table of players gets a Booster Box. Each player opens the pack and takes ONE card and passes what remains of that pack to the player next to them. This is done until all the packs in the box are gone and every player has a deck that they can use. It is impossible to cheat with this and you are not given the opportunity to have all the cards in a broken pack. Seriously people, do some research before raging like infants.
GameSack Also, azneyes is bad at Geography as well as mathget your shit together broski
GameSack I like this because some asshole cant spend money on a top meta. It works more around strategy of the player. If you get enough packs for a 40 card deck, the chances of getting nothing are so slim.
GameSack intresting at best.......... i would try it MT93
GameSack This is a douchebag move by Konami, simply to push their shitty product. Anyone with any amount of skill can pull broken and steal the win from other players who have pushed themselves to get there.
GameSack Opening really well in the packs doesnt mean instawin. A long while ago I attended a Sneak Peek for the Power of the Duelist booster pack and everyone there said Ultimate Tyranno is whats going to win this tournament (3000 beastick who can attack every monster on the field once each). It actually turned out to be someone who had not drawn that card from his original packs who won. Funny thing is he used a completely useless card at the time synthetic seraphim which, in a sneak peek where no counter traps were added, is very much the essence of a dead card.Personally, I like this new option being introduced but would prefer it to be a choice alongside constructed deck tournaments. It really removes the budget barrier between players who have really good expensive cards and those with cheap, less useful cards.
GameSack I agree they need to do something. I beleive the last straw was when EVERYONE started showing up with dragons. Talk about boring. Dont agreee.....then you people that go to these events give Konami suggestions. But jesus talk about luck of the draw using unopened packs.
GameSack stealing from mtg again I see lol
GameSack sorry AznEyesWhiteDragon but drafting is NOT like a prerelease. in a prerelease you play sealed format meaning you make a deck out of the cards in the packs u get a draft is an entirely different format. You sit in a group around a table and then you all open your pack at once, then you each select ONE card and put it in a pile for ur deck face down. then you pass the rest of the cards to the next player! and continue this till all the cards are taken. this is a highly skill oriented format and you can not possibly just open good cards as you will only get 2 or 3 cards from the same pack and people will take the second best and so on before that pack comes back to you. this is good for the game, people need to stop blindly hating.

GameSack since the banlist no longer matters...can i have stratos back? naw, i think that this is good in some way because those that top will have to actually play beyond the meta and we will see quickly who depends on broken cards to much and who dosent. on the other hand, you are playing with a deck that you put together out of random cards and cant really test instead of the deck you felt comfortable competing with. well see what happens though itll be interesting to say the least.
GameSack this is very unfair to the other players because there is no limit to how many packs they can buy so it is clear that even the competitive player will still win because he most likely to buy 20 packs and others will buy 24 giving them a bigger advantage at the tournament because people are using shit decks and there is more constructed I think they should limit the amount to packs they can buy but then again they can just go to a shop and come back on day 2 or 3 saying they pulled all of them
GameSack Konami better do what microsoft did and actually LISTEN to what your player base want and dont want. I really want to get competitive but after this bullshit, fuck that.
GameSack Draft isnt just open the packs yourself and build a deck.
GameSack if they want to test good deck building and measure skill, give everyone the same set of some odd 200 cards, then let them have free reign to make a deck from that. but using luck to give better chance is bullcrap by any standard
GameSack They state, the Americas because America expands from Canada all the way down to Argentina.
GameSack I love this. No more using decks they found on the internet.
GameSack I really dont know how i feel about this... id rather have my own deck to play with than have a random booster pack cards that may or may not be super broken. i mean i understand because of the dragons, but i mean i still want to play with my own deck even though 9 times outta 10 dragons are going to top.
GameSack this is liked by every Dragon ruler haterits awful for the competitive game.What happens if somone pulls crap?my daswell quit now.
GameSack Its the Americas because mexico and Canada are America also we are the united states
GameSack This is a actually a good thing azneyes, the draft makes it so every card has a decision, minus the fact that you can get some broke cards. It reminds me from back in the day where kids had random cards. ARG Open are where its at though haha
GameSack Too be fair isnt Yugioh all ready sack to win?
GameSack I dont think anyone who wins without this new format DESERVES to top. Im sick of seeing the same deck all the time, every time. Its so rare to see something new, and this at least makes strategy and intellect more important than a google search and spending money.
GameSack Of course luck is involved in drafting as in all ygo, finally this shitty company is trying not to have baddies winning their events by increasing the skill the player must have to win and people are compaining about it, i guess u guys prefer to see a 11 year old topping with dinnorabbit or some baddie misplaying all over the place and winning with some op deck, yeah this is why ygo is where it is right now, way to go guys.
GameSack The americas is a term for north south and central america
GameSack This is the stupidest thing that could happen in this game People just have to complain and complain about decks instead of trying to actually play this is gonna kill the competitive scene
GameSack A lot of people in these comments seem to think Draft and Sneak Peak Sealed are the same thing.
GameSack Except thats fucking wrong. Theres a difference between a sealed event and a draft event. Youre describing a sealed. A draft is where you open a pack, pick a card, pass pack to an adjacent player. There is strategy involved. You need to evaluate cards and take a guess on what may or may not come back to you.This has been a sanctioned format in Magic the Gathering for over 15 years with some sets designed TO be drafted. From Mirage (1996) to Modern Masters (2013), its actually been a thing.BREAD up in this motherfucker.
GameSack If its like magic theyll make valid packs put in white paper and then mark each card with a stamp to make it a little more fair
GameSack Draft is very different to sealed. You get one card from a pack before you pass it on. You need to both pick what your deck needs, and try to figure out what the people next to you are taking, so you can deny them what they need, or take early what you feel will be in short supply.
GameSack I dont know why people are freaking out about this. I know MtG is different from Yugioh, but magic has had a Draft format for a while. Its actually REALLY skill testing, and requires you to know what your opening from the set and building a strategy from that. It isnt really about opening bombs, and more about building a decent deck with synergies. I dont really see the issue with this as a setup. To be fair, I dont think konami builds the sets with drafters in mind so this might be more of an issue, but youre building a 20 card deck.
GameSack I think you are confusing draft with sealed. The Top 16 will be a draft, which is actually a very skill intensive format. Sealed is where you just open up your packs and build a deck.Go watch one or two Channel Fireball Magic drafts.
GameSack Probably a horrible idea but lawlsy to the very least.
GameSack They call it The Americas because there are more than one. Do schools in the states forget to mention there are seven continents, including North and South America?
GameSack Who runs this business? I saw this happen in several European countries and thought: if they were to do this in the United Stated people would go crazy. I just hate the very core of this idea. By making a ban listening that changed four times a year I was applauding applauding Konami because that means more decks would see play and prices of really good cards would eventually go down because they were more likely to get hit on the approaching ban list. I thought Konami had evened the playing field somewhat. I mean, think about it. Now, playing Blackwings puts your in the Tier 1.5 to 2 area and the deck is inexpensive. But making a really childish type of YCS seems like going too far to make it fair. If you are thinking of Yugioh the same way you think of sports teams, then some decks should be naturally better than others. Idk, I just really want the toplevel and famous played to come out say say Hell No! to this idea.
GameSack Isnt all the top decks Dragon (or something else) Rulers have past their regional anyways? Like I know that might be poorly worded, but what I am trying to say is that the finals will probably be the same kind of deck anyways, and will come down to most likely luck anyways.
GameSack The website makes it sound like they arent just going to give them a bunch of packs, and that these guys have to build a deck using only the cards available inside the set.
GameSack All they have to do is stop printing Sacky cards.
GameSack This is 100 percent luck now
GameSack You know.... I think google bought both Youtube AND Koonami at once
GameSack Do u get to keep the cards you pull???
GameSack They call it the Americas because the US is the only country that refers to itself as America and as a northern continent, in other countries America is a whole not the US or northern and south america
GameSack i do not like this at all
GameSack In a way this is a good thing considering how easy someone can win with certain decks such as E dragons.
GameSack The part where he said SKILLS and YUGIOH in the same sentence. LOL
GameSack You would never get multiple high priestess because you only get one ultra rare per box and you arent supposed to use it in the duel anyway its for you to keep and also they wrote like 10 articles on all the things they did to make it balanced so you should be able to use a decent deck so this is a good thing because it adds diversity to the game. DIVERSITY is the key word here.
GameSack I went to The Lord of the tachyon galaxy and pulled nothing but mecha phantom beasts and other garbage. The strategy I had to use was wait for 3 cards in my deck those were two abyss scale of the mizuchi and abyssocea. So yeah I see how this draft idea sucks.
GameSack I think people are providing too much hate than useful suggestions. I see what Konami is trying to do here. Theyre trying to eliminate the top 16 decks being nearly the same deck, and the top rounds being a deciding factor of a dice roll, or a ridiculous opening hand. What I think they should do instead is provide some sort of test, like the duel puzzles on YGO pro. Yes, this takes the fun out of it by actually removing the card play aspect, but if youre going to a YCS, and you make top 16, chances are that youre not there for the fun.
GameSack If Konami is the one providing the packs, I am not complaining.
GameSack They are right, winning through ingenuity doesnt mean anything. Its all about winning with brokedragons and swarms.
GameSack ahhh being older and hearing greek names IS THE BEST THING EVER!!!!!
GameSack Mortal Kombat 2 should have been in there.
GameSack Road Rash 2 and Street Fighter 2.
GameSack A couple of sequels that are better than the originals:Megaman 2Sonic 2 (not hard, considering the original sucks major nuts)Street Fighter 2 (kinda like with Sonic 2, the first was crap)SSBM over SSB64Mario Kart 64Donkey Kong Country 2Sonic Adventure 2 (kinda like the FIRST Sonic, SA1 was god awful. SA2 wasnt great, but there wasnt any of those DAMNED fishing levels, so thats an improvement in my book)
GameSack David Jaffe had nothing to do with god of war 2, 3 or the rest of the games.
GameSack I could not agree more about Dragons FuryDevils CrushDevil Crash. I never really enjoyed pinball games, but I still play this one to this day.
GameSack Hey guys, Newish subscriber. Im really enjoying expanding my knowledge of gaming with all the obscure systems and games you guys present. Its nice to have a channel that doesnt talk about how great Zelda is all the time and I really like all the Sega info considering Ive been a NES fanboy my entire life. Solid show, fellas!
GameSack I wish I could make my own review of the Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner series, its just the Devil Summoner games, 1 and 2, because thats all Ive played of the Shin Megami Tensei series, but I digress, I cannot do so because Ive no way to make a video. I do not have a camera or mic, unfortunately, so while I would love to go into detail on Devil Summoner 1 and 2, despite the removal of character limits on comments, well, I kinda doubt youd read all of it. Everything about it just makes for a REALLY long comment. But what I can say is that DS 1 is already pretty dang fun, and I like it, but DS 2 improves a LOT. Gives you a few improvements that while playing 1, I was hoping they would make, but they changed even almost the ENTIRE control scheme AND how the battles go! The music, I dont know about, I didnt really pay attention much, since Id only gotten the games not too long ago. The graphics are not too bad in the first one, and I dont think they change too terribly much between the two.
GameSack Turok 2 is much better than turok 1
GameSack Streets of Rage 2, Road Rash 2 and ummm ....Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight.
GameSack I liked GOW1 best of the GOW series kratos was just the easyiest to sympathize with in GOW1better sequalsRE2  RE1megaman X  megaman(as a whole)also i loved super mario bros 2a link to the past
GameSack Megaman II was the first title that came to mind, a huge improvement to the franchise in every conceivable way.
GameSack You said it was Ken Jaffe (15:50) that made God of war. I thought his name was David Jaffe ?
GameSack Scientists from around the world combined their skills while working with the Turbografx16 technology  thus Scientology was born
GameSack What about the Colony Wars series on PSX? There were three, I havent played the second but I prefer the third, Red Sun, over the first because in Red Sun you can choose your missions and gain money to upgrade your ship. You couldnt do that in the first one, although the first did have branching paths and multiple endings.Then theres the SSX series on PS2. That would be interesting to talk about.
GameSack Streets of Rage 2 was a good step up from 1. Also Patapon 2 was so much better than one with better bosses and a lot more content and customisation to do.
GameSack Streets of Rage 2 comes to mind as well as Panzer Dragoon 2. :)
GameSack Oh! Yeah i forgot ape escape 2
GameSack I really love your intro, I think its one of the best I have seen on youtube :)
GameSack Agreed with a lot of people here:Mega Man 1  Mega Man 2Mortal Kombat  Mortal Kombat IITurko 1  Turkok 2Bomberman  Super Bomberman
GameSack Great episode guys as always! For the longest time I didnt want to believe it, but Donkey Kong Country vs. Donkey Kong Country.
GameSack I know that Super Mario Bros 2 was technically not a Mario game when it was first created, but back when it was released in the US very few people knew that. I did enjoy playing the intended sequel when it did see a US release, but I didnt find it nearly as impressive because it was too similar to the first. It felt more like some kind of expansion pack than a sequel.Katamari Damacy is another game that makes my list. I had MULTIPLE great sequels. Although the core gameplay remains pretty much unchanged, the level design, atmosphere, and music make them all a unique experience from one another. The only one that fell short for me was the xbox version, as some of the level transitions just didnt feel as epic as other versions. Actually, the PSP port was a little lackluster too but mainly because there were not two analog sticks so the control felt gimped. Otherwise it would have been fine.One more game thats worth mentioning is Portal and Portal 2. Although the first game was more of a tech demo, it established some memorable characters and unique puzzleplatformer gameplay that actually worked out great for being a first person game, making it able to become a stand alone title. The 2nd game took everything great about the 1st and added much more to it without changing the overall mechanics. The only bad thing about this type of game is there is very little reason to replay once you solve the puzzles. Because of this the coop mode added is really only fun once, provided neither you nor your friend have ever played it.There are several other sequels Im fond of, but Ive already written a wall of text so Ill save my rambling for another video.
GameSack wheres kingdom hearts 2????????????????????????????????????
GameSack OMFG DAT PHANTASY STAR 4
GameSack I have one: Majoras Mask is a superior followup to Ocarina of Time.
GameSack Just a small error. In Castlevania Adventure and Belmonts Revenge you play as Christopher Belmont, not Simon Belmont.
GameSack Great choice there Dave with Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins. The only flaw about the game I found is how easy it is, even for a Mario game. Except for the last stage which I found waaaay harder then all the other levels. Very frustrating when you want to just beat the damn thing already, lol.
GameSack I AM GONNA BURN YOUUU
GameSack Great video  lots of effort and care put into it. Always nice to watch
GameSack Even though Joe didnt mention it, Wonder Boy was a launch title for master system. At least it was in North America.
GameSack Ghouls N Ghosts is a hell of a lot better than Ghosts N Goblins.
GameSack TMNT for the NES, Batman: Arkham series, Marvel vs Capcom, Street Fighter, XMen Legends, Fable, and Mario Kart.
GameSack 10:07 Sega Saturn shirt?
GameSack Thanks guys for great episode!
GameSack I remember when I was playing Super mario and 6 golden coins On my gameboy pocket.Epic.One of the best mario games ever.
GameSack Wow been trying to figure out the name to Pilotwings for the longest...
GameSack Wing Commander 3 and 4 are still awesome and way better than Wing Commander 1 and 2 Aaand you can play as Luke Skywalker :v
GameSack Earthbound(Mother 2) is a much better and easier game than the first. As good as Mother was, it sadly didnt make it over here to the States officially and is a very hard game unless you grind a lot.
GameSack twisted metal!! the original was alright twisted metal 2 is one of the greatest games ever
GameSack System Shock 2? Surely?
GameSack Great as always, guys!I think Samurai Shodown II and Uncharted 2 were a couple sequels that were better than their predecessors.
GameSack Streets of rage 2Sonic 2Xmen 2 clone warsPokemon goldsilvercrystalGalagaStreet fighter 2Mortal kombat 2Batman arkham cityRed dead redemption Nba streets vol 2
GameSack Was Miyamoto really wearing a Sega Saturn TShirt?...LOL.
GameSack Oddworld Abes Oddysee was a great game, one of my favorite of all time. but Oddworld Abes Exoddus was the superior game by far. with added gameplay mechanics and an improved save system the sequel took everything we loved from the first and made it a hundred times better... however the same cannot be said for every installment released since. and with a new game on the horizon i can hardly wait to play the HD remake of the first game, renamed as New n Tasty!
GameSack Great episode guys! Always an inspiration for us. Loved the Wonder Boy segment. Wonder Boy in Monster Land is definitely in my SMS Top 5. Personally I always felt Zillion II: The Tri Formation was a superior sequel to Zillion. Also, NICE call on Devils Crush. Used to play that game for hours with my TG16 buddy!
GameSack Super Mario Galaxy 2, Dragon Warrior 2 and Summon Night Swordcraft Story 2 these sequels are better than the originals that are already great games!
GameSack Wow, since Im not a huge retro gamer I thought I would never see you guys talking about a game I played. Castlevania Belmonts Revenge is so much better than The Adventure. I think what ruined that game for me was the infinitely respawning enemies, specially in the final level, as well as that stupid whip downgrade with every single hit you took.
GameSack Panzer Dragoon 2 on the Saturn was a huge step up for me from the first one. It was so much faster and I really liked the new composer. Virtua Figher 2, same thing. Faster gameplay, crisper graphics just made the game so much better. Tobal No. 2 on the PSX was also really cool. It had a 60 FPS mode that was a blast to play.
GameSack Jurassic Park had the best music out of all the novels Ive ever read.
GameSack Now days with DLC I swear they make the original game crap so they have room to improve during the next 12 sequels I never buy games nemore because they are all shit unless you want to spend another 4050 to get the entire game that you just payed 4050 just to play the demo version I like to call it cuz if you dont buy their dlc you dont get the full game
GameSack Please play gotham city racing for the XBox.
GameSack The evil dead games actually got better with every sequel
GameSack Nice episode, guys! What about Jurassic Park: The lost world for sega genesis? Have you played it? Are you going to highlight it in your future episodes?
GameSack Well, guess Im not going to go to bed now...
GameSack 22:10 yup I know what that game was based off of. Wasnt it Skyrim.Jk
GameSack Silent hill 2 and Simons Quest
GameSack the Dr Grant pissed off had me cracking up!!! Keep up the great work guys!
GameSack Ghouls and Ghosts was a superior sequel to the Ghosts and Goblins.
GameSack Der Langrisser for the SNES is better than Warsong for the genesis
GameSack Dark Cloud was a fantastic game. Dark Cloud 2 was a masterpiece
GameSack what is your opinion mega drive version of Devils crush compared to the tg16?thx for the best on the tube!cheers from sweden
GameSack tony hawk 2 is a zillion times better than tony hawk 1
GameSack i liked the thunderforce 3,4,5 and 6 better than 2 but i honestly loved them all.
GameSack One of my favorite followup games were: Double Dragon 2 (NES)  I liked the fact that you could start off doing every move in the game without having to level up  that you could play two players at the same time. I still didnt like the fact that your weapons disappear after killing a group of enemies.
GameSack Kratose, man I hate that whiny shit stain!Well, I dont know about other people but I dont like QTE because it annihilates your immersion in the game. When Im playing a game, the square button doesnt exist. When I want to jump I dont think oh, I have to press the square button now I think jump!. Then this prompt comes up and Im like shit, wheres squair again?! Oh, right.... its Jump! But then Ive missed the prompt, and you dead, or you keep fighting. Oh, and if its differant each time, its even worse. Then there is the fact that it is playing the same cut scene, over and over again, that you cant even watch. Because you have to constraint on watching for the button presses. It has NOTHING to do with it only a few button presses.Personally, I liked Pilot Wings 1 a lot better than PW64. That might be because of Nostalgia though.
GameSack You guys kick major ass! Street fighter!!!
GameSack How about an episode on the best launch games and another great episode guys.
GameSack I honestly think that Super Mario Bros. 2 (USA) is better than the original. The reason I think its better is because it has a little more to it than the original does, more landscapes, more characters to play as, new enemies (including some like shy guys whod make more appearances) and many memorable tracks to me.
GameSack Sonic 2 and Streets of Rage 2 are couple of superior sequels. I also would also include World Heroes 2 for the Neo Geo and Paper Mario Thousand year door
GameSack Super Mario Bros. 3, Kirbys Dreamland 2
GameSack I know you already talked about this, but, Streets of Rage 2 is light years superior to Streets of Rage.
GameSack Thunder Force II (now that a GAP) James Pond II (same) Otogi 2 (not as much but still a superior sequel to an already amazing game) while i dont agree about Super Mario land 2 since i like them equally  even find the 1st one to be a better platformer, its clear that Devil Crash improved a lot over Alien Crush mainly thanx to the added scrolling which made things so much more enjoyable! i especially love the Mega Drive version with its new  superb bonus stages  its new music! (which are remix of other Tecno Soft games)
GameSack Portal 2 is better than Portal and Metro Last Light is better than Metro 2033.
GameSack GOD OF WAR!!!!!! YYEEEESSSSS!!!!
GameSack Ive got devils crush bad ass game
GameSack mother 2 should be included
GameSack Terranigma. Seriously, Soul Blazer and Illusion of Gaia are blown away by the third in this line...shame it was never released in the US.
GameSack have you played the inazuma eleven series on the dses 3 improved a lot on 2
GameSack BEST REVIEWERS IN YOUTUBESIMPLY tHE BEST
GameSack Wtf . Thats not how you use a stick
GameSack Depresses the hell out of me that I still dont own one of those beautiful machines : Never seen one in a local store around my area ever.....ever.....criminalAlso I would like a Judge Judy game ala Phoenix Wright lol
GameSack LMAO  inserting a NES Game Genie cart into the Neo Geo. hahahOh, and the VHS tape as well. lol Funny stuff.
GameSack Fun video! But... do you really use the stick like that?
GameSack snk is great. i wish they would make more games like they did on neo geo
GameSack Still one of the sleekest and sexiest consoles out there in my opinion.
GameSack Reuploadedi saw that before...
GameSack Later Joe used his Neo Geo to make a grilled cheese sandwich.
GameSack 0:57  Game Sack just got real.
GameSack Im surprised the Game Genie didnt break with all that weight on top of it.
GameSack The holy grail of consoles when I was a kid, 100 for a game was never going to be realistic back then. Would still love one though.
GameSack Work with bakelite disc?
GameSack Im getting a Neo Geo for Christmas and I cant wait to play games on it. Even though I have it on my possession Im not allowed to play on it.
GameSack Lol. I knew this had to be a joke when the video was less than three minutes long.Good video, Joe.
GameSack One life left equals one hit in the palm )
GameSack You guys are Freakin Hilarious!!!!!!
GameSack The most legit of legit videos ever!
GameSack I want an AES or MVS more than any other game system right now... Maybe some day soon.Would be great if SNK could pull the plug that embarrassing NEOGEO X and release a real game machine again. Not likely to happen. Id love to buy a proper remake of the system.
GameSack Maybe if we go back to giant 200 cartridges, we wouldnt have all this broken disc drive trouble! Heck, you could even include the indisc DLC for that much!
GameSack I never knew Vhs worked on the Aes.
GameSack nice dude! I just bought Magician Lord on the MVS. Right now a CMVS is the way to go imo I bought the whole metal slug series for less than 50 each except for 5 which was 80. Is that a legit Neo Turf Masters you have?? O.o that things worth thousands of dollars isnt it?
GameSack Do you have your Duo modified to output RGB?
GameSack Looks like the LaserActive has some real competition...
GameSack So you suck at gaming, the point is clear, not very funny though..
GameSack The last thing before my father passed away. she must have his soul because she still plays like a queen.
GameSack Be easy with that Turf Masters!!
GameSack Monday upload? Only a 2 minute video? Wtf is going on here?BTW joe has a pretty decent job. SNK vs Capcom AES is worth about 300.
GameSack Hey Wada ya know Jo great video , like someone else said Id like to see you guys do more of a neo geo feature
GameSack lol.. Who holds a joystick like that? XD
GameSack Joes way of saying: I own a Neo Geo, FTW!
GameSack hi guy i need help i am buying a neo geo AES from japan i was told i will need to get a AC power supply to play it here in the U.S i dont know much about the neo geo AES could really use some help plz.
GameSack you gotto do best soundtrack video
GameSack WTF Turbo Graph FX in Neo Geo was classic!For all those who cannot get their hands on a NEO GEO the Wii U is a good substitute. There are enough arcade perfect games from Neo Geo available on Wii U through VC app in Wii Mode.. I own about 20 Neo Geo Games including my fovorite Sengoku 3 and Art of Fighting 3.
GameSack 0:36 DUDE! You touched the label with your fingers! (yes I am one of those who take the Neo Geo very seriously). lol, but its true you should never do that
GameSack I bet it cant handle zx spectrum games :p
GameSack Nice Vid. especially the VHS part.... LOL.
GameSack I want a Neo Geo AES still, but still quite expensive for a console that is 23 years old. Games are more expensive on ebay than a Wii U, PS3 or 360 console. Still cheaper than a PS4 console, but come on that is ridiculous.
GameSack wait did you unibios the neogeo
GameSack Neo Geo is so overrated, i swear ppl only want it because they couldnt afford it back in the day and want to feel like they have something niche.
GameSack Lol, uknow u a gamer when u got extra long thumbs lol gaming thumbs to stick.in ur asshole when u got a deep clogging lmao
GameSack the god of home consoles.
GameSack Having never owned a neo geo it amazes me that a VHS cassette fits into the cart slot on the system...
GameSack I had a Japanese AES in the early 2000s, but unfortunately had to see it when I got into a major automobile accident and my car needed work I couldnt afford. I sold it at a gain though which was nice, but I still miss my copies of Fatal Fury 13, SamSho 13 and Art of Fighting 12
GameSack Thats the Classic Gamesack Sounds that i wanna hear :)Joe the Editing in this Clip is awesome.
GameSack Unsubscribed. Then Resubscribed just to unsubscribe again. The Neo Jio (to use PROPER JAPANESE pronunciation) is nothing to take lightly AT ALL. It had an amazing selection of games and some of the best sprite work and pixel on ANY Console. The Arcade ports were nearly perfect! How would you like it if I made Skanky Anne Frank parody videos? You wouldnt be laughing then, would you? Now, if youll excuse me, I have to close this pathetic window as I have a Neo Jio to emulate.
GameSack good one joe! but did you know it also works with the 32X! lol! love the show guys when im not commercial fishing or playing video games during the long cold alaskan winters im watching Game Sack! you guys are the perfect match up of NES fanboy and Sega Fanboy. i love both soo is awesome. id have to say tho that sega has the most broken games ( HEAVY NOVA!) the genesis was the first system i bought myself w my paper route money. Keep them videos coming and Game On!
GameSack Your hands are a little bit ugly.
GameSack How did you managed to cheat in the Neo Geo?
GameSack love the channel you guys! Hey Joe, is the song on this episode a remix of a Legendary Axe II stage theme? The main theme of this song keeps reminding me of the song in stage 2, or 3, maybe even the 1st stage. Any help would be appreciated. Keep up the good work on the high quality episodes you have been cranking out, and I look forward to more!
GameSack that was some excellent editing joe! kudos
GameSack Neo Geo: it only does everything.
GameSack That was it? I expected more than just a short. I thought I was still watching the intro, but them the intro was the whole video!
GameSack You can play Hucards on the neo geo??
GameSack Mooaree!!! of this plz...
GameSack Saw the video, tried all that stuff on my 2 slot MVS machine... guess it only works for the AES.
GameSack Who in the world uses an arcade stick like that?!
GameSack Consolized NeoGeo MVS FTW!
GameSack This vid made me laugh
GameSack I remember this video. I LOLd
GameSack Wait, the NeoGeo has a headphone output? Wow, I didnt know that. Never seen anyone use it before. Systems these days should still have one for private listeninggaming.
GameSack You really need to do an episode on the neo guys! I have been waiting for it,! Nice taster though :D
GameSack Such a versatile console! lol
GameSack Im impressed with how crisps you get the image quality from that Neo Geo.
GameSack Yeah...NEO GEO at its best! Great generation!
GameSack Watching this made me smile.
GameSack I loved the Neo Geo! It seems Im the only one in this community that bought the Neo Geo AES when it firt came out at full price(700) and for three years I bought most of its games at full price(200). I was a Neo Geo hardcore fan!
GameSack only time we ever saw these back in the day was in the import ad section of mean machines (an english megadrive magazine) and we all couldnt believe the prices but were blown away with the screenshots and could only wonder what it would be like to own such a powerful arcade console at home.In hindsight,all of the games are just coin munchers with swish graphics or fighters and its probably the shallowest console in history haha..I think it works better as an arcade machine personally as you get the thrill of feeding it coins and would love an mvs cab with a multicart at home
GameSack CHEATING WILL RESULT IN PERMANENT BAN
GameSack My favorite video game system. Ive got the NeoGeo X and some MVS cart
GameSack Final burn alpha is the only way to truly play the neoego. I mean geo.
GameSack what is the card slot on the NeoGeo really for?
GameSack Not sure if Google shares videos automatically or not. If not, then here is the latest episode. I dont see it being automatically posted on the page but then again I dont know what Im doing when it comes to Google  :)
GameSack They did make a game about Pepsi...Pepsi man...
GameSack New Super Mario Bros. 2 is pretty disappointing for me, it just feels like a rehash of NSMBWii with some new levels.
GameSack Ducktails IS hard as fuck on nes.
GameSack I see all rocket knight adventure fans feel the same way.
GameSack Best turning a WWII remote face EVERRR!
GameSack 23:00 Listen to the sound she makes when she jumpkicks. Is she coughing up a fur ball or something?
GameSack Medievil II. First of all it continues a story that ended perfectly and had NO NEED for a sequel. And on top of that it doesnt live up to the fun imaginative madness of the original by setting the game in 1880s London instead of the fictional kingdom of Gallowmere. Gallowmere let the developers create their own lore and a cast of wacky but awesome characters. Whereas Victorian London kind of limits them to the places and people of those times. Like Jack the Ripper. I am not bullshitting you Jack the Ripper is actually in this game. And hes basically British Freddy Kreuger. Also theres no longer a free roaming feel where you can do some levels in any order you want. Now the game is completely linear and only lets you complete the game in the order it wants you to. And finally it has a TERRIBLE ending thats not only a cliffhanger but also makes no goddamned sense and just leaves you saying ...what in the hell was THAT?! For the longest time I had II and not I. I am so glad thats been reversed recently. 3
GameSack Diggin that BowserRage Against The Machine crossover shirt.
GameSack Why no spin tricks during excite truck?
GameSack Jazz Jackrabbit might be one. First game was perfect, but second... Well, technically it was good, had better graphics, level editor and multiplayer... But something was off. All fun was taken out, 3D bonus levels, boss fights werent so entertaining and that title rap track... Oh god, I hated it  JJ1 title music is so much better.
GameSack Im not sure if this port counts as a disappointing followup or not but Marvel vs Capcom on the Playstation is a bit disappointing in comparison to the arcade version.
GameSack Slow tedious scavenger hunt VS good platforming I dont get it Dav the 2nd one is clearly better. Sparkster is so disappointing its worth way more money then the first, WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN! I wanna play this game dammit.
GameSack I thought Halo 2 was pretty bad when I played it. The story was crap, game play was crap, and the ending was crap. It just didnt have the charm the first did, and they removed the assault rifle.
GameSack hmm... the port of Cool Spot on snes was so slow copared to Genesis
GameSack Why have you cut the fart noise at the start ? being a 35 year old child like I am I miss it :(
GameSack No more Zelda 2 bashing! Foooools!
GameSack Come on Dave, Zelda 2 wasnt that hard. Enjoyed the video as always.
GameSack Suzy Kolber was a sportscaster from ESPN on the Extreme Sports game. I think her best bit of acting was fending off Joe Namath. Broadway Joe
GameSack crafting music from FFXIV 1.0 at the end there. WTF?
GameSack That Dave shirt is awesome
GameSack I fucking love you guys the chemistry, the (subtle) biases, the format, everything. I really appreciate this gaming channel. Keep in mind I watch alot of them and this is absolutely my favorite. I always go to it when I need a pickmeup or just to kill time and attain knowledge about one of my most beloved hobbies. Thank you guys, please dont stop.
GameSack Jeremy Parish wrote a fantastic analysis of Zelda II here: http:www.2dimensions.com20130307theanatomyofzeldaiiigenreshiftIts definitely my least favourite entry in the series but reading this made me appreciate it a little more.
GameSack As much as I loved both, I would say the Darkness 2 wasnt as good as the original, I guess most things arent though )
GameSack Your show is immensely entertaining. I made a video this morning about snow boarding. Its about two minutes long. Maybe you might give feedback. I used Google video editor. Merci. Bromley 2014 Chad Snowboarding
GameSack I recommend Blaster Master Overdrive on wiiware. Love the show Guys!
GameSack You guys suck, Spot Goes To HollyWood on the Genesis is classic. It sucked on the Playstation, you should have reviewed that one.
GameSack There is also a shooter in the el viento series which is also glitchy and features Annette in hentai cut scenes
GameSack SparksterRocket Knight 2 for the Genesis is garbage! Thank God the El Viento sequel never came here.
GameSack You guys just have the coolest damn shirts, I wish you had a list of links to where you got the ones you wear on the show or something, though I imagine its a variety of different sites and stores and thatd probably be a bit of a hassle.. but still!
GameSack Did you guys upload this late? I got this video in the morning central time
GameSack I have been trying to find El Viento for my collection. Havent had good luck though :(
GameSack Another excellent episode guys. There were a few sequels I didnt even know about but having seen some of these I think Ill give them a miss. I actually had the misfortune of owning Toejam  Earl 2 as a kid, needless to say, I mostly played the original.Keep the good stuff coming, I cant wait for the next episode!
GameSack like if you hate the new google comment update
GameSack ExciteTruck good? ExciteBots not fun? Should have swallowed his Gamer Card, Joe. )
GameSack did you guys kiss and make up?
GameSack Jak II it was alright but the original Jak and Daxter was way better IMO
GameSack Zelda II, that game was awesome! Its one of the best in the series imo.
GameSack bioshock infinite comes to mind
GameSack Skyward Sword was slightly disappointing as well as Brawl.
GameSack dragons lair 2 was much worse than the first one, the fun thing in the first one was that the stages came in a random order and sometimes inverted, DL2 was just a quicktime event movie.
GameSack One of the biggest disappointments for me was getting Resident Evil REmake on the Gamecube, loving the hell out of it, and then getting Resident Evil 0....and yeah...its a great looking game, but not as much fun...not as big and epic, and the partner zapping was a stupid gimmick. :(
GameSack Thanks for calling out Zelda II. I love the series, and I know a lot of ppl are probably pissed about this but Zelda II was always kind meh for me, for the reasons you stated. It almost felt as though it was one of those cases where it started out as something else entirely and ended up a zelda sequel.
GameSack Its not called a ripoff if you take something from the same game (series) on another system.
GameSack Strider and Strider Returns on the Genesis. Strider Returns takes everything cool about the first game and throws them out the window. The tight controls, brisk pace, cool stages and awesome music are replaced with garbage. On top of that, the plot of Strider Returns involves reducing your girlfriend, how hackey is that?
GameSack Great episode guys! I couldnt agree more with you guys I was obsessed with Rocket Knight Adventures and when I played Sparkster it just wasnt the same and kinda left a bad taste in my mouth after playing it! Definitley stick with RKA! :)
GameSack Hexen II deserves an honorary mention, even though you dont really cover PC games here. The original took the Doom engine and turned it into something even more amazing with hubbased levels, event scripting, rotating doors, and multiple player classes. The Quakeengined sequel followed up with jerky controls, halfassed levels, sadistic difficulty and recycled MIDI music (in 1997).
GameSack Never even heard of this channel but these videos are really good, informative and humorous I love channels that introduce me to new games and almost every video I have seen so far has done so in spades
GameSack Super Paper Mario. Uuughh...
GameSack Right on the money on all spots, even though I have a soft spot for Zelda II and dont care much for the first game because I knew II first, I understand the appeal and I love the SNES sequel. Great job.
GameSack I hate to spam like this, but Im a new channel and would love it if you could check out my latest video. Thanks! http:youtu.beWsKymmc7o84
GameSack I always wanted The Adventures of Link when I was a kid. I got it now and its on my bucket list, near the end of it.
GameSack Great video. A game that disappointed me a lot was GTA IV, compared to Vice City and San Andreas. I dont know if you guys play that kind of games, though.
GameSack All hail Game Sack!! truly a great show. I hope you guys never lose your spark.
GameSack Youre absolutely right, a Crystal Pepsi game seems like a..............wait for it..............clear choice for a video game :) Sorry, I just couldnt help myself.
GameSack Outrun Europa on the Amiga was disappointing. It wasnt terrible, but it also strayed far from the original Outrun design. Another great episode. Keep up the good work.
GameSack Metroid Other M. After the Prime series that was a disgrace.
GameSack Excite Truck was great, so addictive, agreed with you on that, got it at launch with Zelda at Sears in South Hills Village. Never played Excite Bots. Glad I didnt haha.
GameSack LET ME BLAST IN PEEEEEACE!!!!Christ, I lost it. Love you guys.
GameSack the chick with the tude in the espn game is actually a young Suzy Kolber. She is still on espn and the host of the show NFL Live
GameSack Wax that China li in the windows in el viento?
GameSack Return of Strider. Also known as Oh God, Why?
GameSack Hey, Joe, I like that shirt! Is it supposed to symbolize how Capcom has apparently killed Megaman off?P.S.: I like your shirt, too, Dave!
GameSack Deus Ex.1st is a masterpiece and lies in top 3 best games ever made.2nd an abomination that ruined everything.Also, Ducktales is easy.
GameSack Where can I sign up for the Gamesack school of acting? Are swishy pants a requirement?
GameSack Guys, I liked your mention of Excite Trucks. I bought a launchday Wii and out of all the games, Excite Trucks is far and away the game I play the most on my Wii, period (although Smooth Moves! is a close second). Its just so goofy fun. I learned about Excite Bots and was planning on getting it this week thanks for saving me from disappointment! Speaking off Wii, I would say the Wii use is a disappointing followup console! Even Nintendo is slackin with solid firstparty releases for the thing!
GameSack Why does everyone hate majoras mask? I love that game it was the first Zelda I ever got in to. Collecting all the masks was good fun even if it led to extreme frustration when you had to start all over at the beginning of the three days if you messed up getting one
GameSack You guys should do an all Zelda episode. It would be epic!
GameSack A couple of more ideas on these: Lethal Enforcers 1 was awesome. Lethal Enforcers 2: Gun Fighters, just wasnt that great.Another one great game was Operation Wolf. Its sequel, Operation Thunderbolt, was okay especially because it was two players at the same time. To me it just didnt have the same quality that Wolf had. There are several instances where tons of knives  grenades are being thrown at you by enemies.
GameSack Im sorry but I cant see anything fun in walking around at a slow pace collecting stuff and avoiding boring enemies in uncreative environments.
GameSack Most of the reboot games have been disappointing. Castlevania, Contra, and of course, Blaster Master. Would rather just download the 8 bit originals.
GameSack I actually prefer the sidescrolling and experience system of Zelda II over the first one (wich ofcourse isnt bad either), even though i seem to be pretty lonely with thinking that.
GameSack extreme 1 and 2 were both bad for me, but 3xtreme did it right, third try was a lucky charm, and all the hidden characters were just amazing and took the series to a whole different level, spent so man hours playing the game :D
GameSack Hey! That chick on the XGames FMV is Suzy Kolber. Shes still on ESPN and covers the NFL. Can anyone say cougar? Haha
GameSack ha game, I am disappoint
GameSack Streets of Rage 2 was a vast improvement over the first but the 3rd game in the series took a step back. At least in the PAL region. Changing the characters clothing colours and the difficulty was set much higher than NTSC and JPN version of the game.
GameSack Wolf Team is not perfectTell that to Star Ocean...
GameSack Maybe everyone already knows this but Excite Truck is actually a sort of follow up to Excite Bike on the NES. I heard that somewhere but I cant remember where.
GameSack there are some really wrong things in this video...Cool Spot on Mega Drive  Genesis is a lot better than the SNES version : better gameplay better animations higherres... its a great platformer
GameSack I thought for sure Strider Returns would have made the list.

GameSack You guys missed the Remake of Metal Gear Solid 1, Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes on Nintendo Game Cube. :) Would have been interesting to hear your thoughts on this. :)
GameSack Final Fantasy 3 for the DS was a pretty good remake. I hear FF4 also got the same 3d remake as 3 but Im unsure of that.Halo anniversary was a pretty good remake of the original Halo as well though Im unsure whether it was done entirely from scratch or they just slapped new graphics on an old game.
GameSack Under 5 dollars, PLUS SHIPPING!!!Dont you mean INCLUDING SHIPPING!!!?
GameSack The first Castlevania game had two different remakes I believe. Super Castlevania IV and Castlevania Chronicles. From what I saw it seems like a remake.
GameSack How about the GBADS remakes of NESSuper Nintendo games, there are quite a few.
GameSack Oh my god I saw that monkey king game in the pawn shop this weekend for 3 bucks..........gotta get back up there tomorrow because they are closed on Sunday.
GameSack Whats the point of saying where the music came from if they dont give us the musics name, Im trying to find that last music that plays on the credits but I cant find it.
GameSack Sonic 1 and 2 remastered for iOS and android.
GameSack in Dracula X Chronicles, you can unlock both the original Rondo of Blood, and Symphony of the Night by collecting 2 hidden items... so that game is actually the best version of the game. The SOTN version included also lets you play as richter and Maria right off the bat without having to complete the game first. Unfortunately it doesnt have the extra areas from the saturn version.
GameSack Megaman Powered Up sucked. Really hated the changes, even if they were just minor in the original mode game.Edit: Megaman Maverick Hunter X was another turd. The SNES original was perfect, there was no need to remake this at all. If they did feel the need to do it, why not just make it in HD without the ugly polyginal based graphics. What a waste, much like the X games that were dumped out by Capcom on PS2.Finally, the remake of Ys 3. There was nothing really all that wrong with the original game, it was just a tad to short. The remake on PSP (and JPN only PC release) has no right to even exist with even worse and more annoying voice acting.
GameSack Street Fighter 2 HD remix
GameSack I really want someone to remake Deep Fear...
GameSack The original Flashback wasnt that hard. I completed it on my real Amiga, and I also completed the Genesis version in an emulator.
GameSack Joe! You really like the Flashback remake? I usually agree with your opinions in these videos, but I cant agree with this. Youre definitely in the minority here. To each their own, though. Either way, great video!
GameSack Ididnt knew that The monkey King on the Wii was a remake. And you are the first person I heard that liked Flashback on the XBOX.FF1  2 on the GBA were great remakes, and Metroid Zero Mission was one of the best remakes ever along with Resident Evil Remake.
GameSack I never found Dracula X Chronicles unresponsive, like at all, maybe Im weird... XD
GameSack Castle of Illusion and Duck Tales remakes are also available on PC.
GameSack I really like joe but he looks about as smart as a cave man but I love there episodes no offense dude your still a kick ass dude and I would love to grab beers with you two anytime
GameSack Pokemon remakes e.g. Soul silverheart gold
GameSack Yeah, I wanted to download TMNT IV: ReShelled awhile back on my 360. Needless to say, I was not happy to find out it was no longer available. People say it wasnt very good, but I still wanted to try it out.
GameSack What? No Streets of Rage Remake? Yo soy disappoint.Also, TMNT: Reshelled sucked anyway. You didnt miss anything.
GameSack I checked the xbox store and tmnt re shelled I still available on the UK store
GameSack No mention of Bionic Commando: Rearmed, one of the greatest remakes of all time... ALL TIME!
GameSack But its The Legend Begins not The Journey Begins O.O
GameSack When you have a 12 hour work day just sitting behind a computer. A lot of Gamesacking is going down. Thanks guys!
GameSack Unfortunately, the guys in charge of Powered Up have said they were planning on remaking the second Mega Man, but ultimately couldnt due to low sales.
GameSack I am a Castlevania geek and I only wish I had a TG16 CD so I could play that version of that game. I have the PSP disc and agree about the controls in the remake.I also am glad I have the org PS1 disc for SOTN and bought the download for my PS3PSP as I loved the original crappy voice acting in the org and hated the replacement voices on the PSP!
GameSack Blaster Master (the remake is a Wiiware exclusive).
GameSack what about pokemon? ):
GameSack Resident Evil Remake for the Gamecube is the remake of all remakes. If you havent then you should play it.
GameSack you forgot megaman X, oh.. you dont like it
GameSack Dragon Force is awesome as fuck.
GameSack I was thinking you guys would just take a dump on Castle of Illusion and Duck Tales Remastered but I was kinda surprised when you didnt.IMO Many 2.5D remakes where bad due to the artistic ability of the artists doing the remake and how they where trying to ape the style while making 3D assets suitable for use on less capable systems. Neither of which happened with the aforementioned games in this post. Of course if you are a 8bit or 16bit purist nothing but a 1:1 to the original release would please you. But I quite enjoyed those remakes especially playing the PC versions at 2560x1440 with antialiasing enabled. If I could have those kind of graphics back in the day on those titles I would have jumped at it in a heart beat. I especially like how the original voices from the cartoon came back one more time for the Duck Tales Remake. I dont think I could ask for a better remake.And I say this as someone who sometimes still plays old games and has an interest in them.
GameSack Nintendo do an update for the 30th anniversary :)
GameSack You forgot about the super Mario advance series. That was the best version of Mario all stars!!!
GameSack Castle of Illusion and Duck Tails are remakes I am glad to have on my PSN although I still love playing the originals also, but as well I will have to check out The Monkey Kind as it looks interesting.
GameSack 16:41 Stateside it had the awesome name of the Monkey King: the Journey Begins But it says Legend on the title screen....  Anyway  is a much cooler name (at least for the original)...
GameSack Thumbs up if you own both versions of Super Mario AllStars on the SNES and Wii! D
GameSack Literally, this is the first time Ive heard ANYBODY recommend the Flashback Remake. .
GameSack What about Pokemon? FireRedLeafGreen andor HeartGoldSoulSilver next!
GameSack For a remake of this episode (lame, I know), try covering Tony Hawks Pro Skater and its HD remake from summer 2012.
GameSack For the record I agree that Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles was cheaply made believe it or not a hell of alot of other games are being made like that. Worst one is Mirror of Fate, Judgement, and Lords of Shadow its kinda sad really. It makes the puzzle game of Castlevania look better then anything.
GameSack No love for Klonoa?Why...
GameSack Im surprised that you guys didnt talked about the GameCube remakes of Resident Evil  Metal Gear Solid! The remake of Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider Anniversary. Pokemon remakes of Red  Blue. Oh yeah and Pokemon Gold  Silver
GameSack Guys dont worry about TMNT REshelled you dodged a bullet. Its utter crap and cant even hold a candle to any of the old TMNT beatemups. I downloaded it and played it one time, dropped it and went right back to the old games.
GameSack Suggestions for if you do another one of these: Phantasy Star Generation 1 (English translation available online now for play via Playstation emulator), Bionic Commando ReArmed (PS3X360PC), Monkey Island Special Edition Collection (PS3X360PC), PunchOut!! (Wii), Final Fantasy III (NDS), Tomb Raider: Anniversary (Wii), and Ys III Eternal (NDS)
GameSack Its probably the best looking match up between 2D and 3D that Ive ever seenBlazblue.No no, Im serious, check it out if you dont already know it. I dont know, maybe it slipped by you somehow.
GameSack In regards remakes Escape from Monkey Island is recommended for any PC Gamers who love the SCUMM based games, just fingers crossed they will remake Manic Mansion 2: Day of the Tentacle (Although digital only and I would love a physical Big Box copy) or Full Throttle :(
GameSack hey what bout megaman x and megaman maverick hunter x?
GameSack Youre right digital releases suck balls. It breaks my heart that they take games away over time. Its like they dont exist now. Thankfully Reshelled sucks balls so you didnt miss much. Im mostly upset that I didnt have the chance to download the TMNT Arcade game when it was on there... (
GameSack Maybe Nintendo will do better on the 30th anniversary edition of Super Mario Brothers... I really hope so...
GameSack I own Ubisofts Turtles in Time game for the PS3. If you missed buying it, then you did yourself a favor.
GameSack God I hated that Flashback remake. I was so excited for it too, oh well, Ducktales was an awesome remake.
GameSack wild arms alter code f was a great remake in my mind....
GameSack You guys probably only do consoles, but for me the greatest remake of them all, Monkey Islands 1 and 2.It is perfect in every way and the function to switch between old and new so seemless was a simple stroke of genius :)
GameSack What a great channel, Came here with recommendation from Happy Console Gamer, glad I did, going to have a great time looking back through your old videos
GameSack Dragon Force remake would be awesome
GameSack rocket knight adventures
GameSack How DARE you hate the statue of liberty and the twin towers where were you in 911? Oh wait you gays were having a party and saying thanks to the terrorist. Game sack is stewped end gheeeeey
GameSack guys, I loved the cloud master vid, i never knew there was a wii version,now I will get one just to play it,thanks
GameSack love your vids! keep em comin!
GameSack Do you record with a single cam or multiple? Just curious as some stuff there is... very complex with a single cam :D
GameSack I like Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD ReMix because of its gameplay, grahpic, and music updates
GameSack I got the physical copy of ducktales for ps3. Great game. Also thanks for telling me about Monkey King on Wii. I got this complete for 1.99 at disc replay.
GameSack Hey guys great channel! Heard about you from the happyconsolegamer and just subscribed!
GameSack What about Prince of Persia for snes? not sure if a remake but it has a lot more levels and improved gameplay, i loved it. It was made by the guys from Target Earth and Cybernator too
GameSack Double Dragon Neon is the best remake Ive ever played.
GameSack There were two remakes that you completely left out:Sega Classics Collection (Golden Axe) for the PS2  The original Golden Axe for the Arcade  Genesis were both awesome. The remake on the PS2 was just plain awful. The stages were extremely long.Double Dragon II: Wander Of The Dragons  This also was a very crappy remake of the original. I liked the NES version much better than the remake of this game.
GameSack A reason there are no black borders is because the tv wont autoadjust to a stretched wide screen.
GameSack Yay I have zero mission, it was fun!
GameSack I hate that digital console thing. I wanted to buy Marvel Vs Capcom 2 and its not in the stores anymore.
GameSack resident evil and metal gear for the gamecube!
GameSack I like Castlevania Chronicles for the PS1, but its more an updateremix of the Sharp X68000 game which was a loose update of the NES game.
GameSack I think you guys are great can you do a review of current console RPGs please or maybe a portable games isode I think it would be interesting
GameSack I was expecting to see Bionic Commando rearmed, but good show, non the less, gentlemen.
GameSack Compare Resident Evil 1, 2, and 3 to their many remakes. said The Playstation guy...
GameSack I dont love mario all stars. The jumping kinda became floaty. I was actually able to beat the lost levels thanks to the save feature.
GameSack As much as I liked Zero Mission, I felt the stealth mission at the end was completely added on just to boost the length of the game. And it didnt really add much of anything in my experience.
GameSack The remake of Cave Story was okay at best.
GameSack digital products piss me off so much, soooooooo many games and dlc get yanked off the market with no reason ever given as to why, like the new game plus dlc for the original Bioshock, last year i won an auction on ebay to buy the game specifically for the new game plus dlc only to find it no longer existed on xbl, i was beyond pissed, and out over a hundred bucks for nothing! this is why digital products should be done away with!
GameSack super neo mega turbo? super neo mega turbo 267800 mark 3 and im in!
GameSack fugazi huh? did u know theres a fugazi wutang mashup called wugazi?check it out its good
GameSack Hahaha! Stupid statue of liberty! I could so relate to that.
GameSack where did they include the original Metroid on Zero Mission?
GameSack Mit Sprachen hast dus nicht so, ne? Oder wie sonst erklrst du den flieenden bergang von der spanischen Ansage ins franzsische Kauderwelsch :D Eure Gegner hatten wirklich gute Reparatsen an Bord. Aber das stndige Rammen htte nun wirklich nicht sein mssen. Macht doch irgendwann keinen Spa mehr...
GameSack Da habt ihr euch aber ein paar Helden als Ingenieure eingefangen. Wie sie noch im Chat drber diskutieren, wer wo was zu machen hat, weil sie sich offenbar nicht einig waren. Dann kann das ja auch nix werden :D Rahm und Fred haben wohl gar nicht aufgenommen? Schade, das htt ich ganz gern gesehen :(
GameSack ich bin omnisprachfhig, um maximale verwirrung zu stiften :D
GameSack Sag mal, Fred, du hast es im Moment auch mit deinem Ton, oder? Oder hast du direkt nach 7 Days to Die aufgenommen und deswegen fehlt der Ton?
GameSack Mensch, ihr sollt doch mal sagen wann ihr spielt :D Bei den groen Servern wr es sicher lustig eine Runde gegen euch, oder auch mit euch zu zocken. Ich mag das Spiel sehr, hat viel taktischen Charakter, da verstehe ich die Kritiken wirklich nicht...lahmes Gameplay und so. Spielt man ber TS oder hnliches hat es auf jeden Fall einen guten Coop Charakter.
GameSack Bei Rahm kommt die Folge morgen noch. Da ich leider ohne Sound aufgenommen habe, bin ich noch am Basteln und meine Folge kommt noch spter )
GameSack Deswegen sollt ihr das ja ndern :P
GameSack Viel Spa mit Guns Of Icarus! :)
GameSack bei denen kommt alles spter :)
GameSack Die stiftest du auch so :P
GameSack The line is pulling the the to screen block, of course an inside blitz will be a sack on the CPU.
GameSack No one is blocking(screen pass?)
GameSack I met someone online that tried this with me. They got me the first few times, but then I ate them alive with screens and quick passes.
GameSack Haha! When the offense is running a screen it doesnt take much to get to the qb
GameSack I do this without the screen play I forced 3 fumbles in a row with the same person and scored all three times with it using the play I choose thunder struck or thunder something and forced a fumble or sacked the quarter back all 3 downs every time ! And this is my first day ever playing it cause i got it today go to my channel and look and see what real blitz is ! And by the way I need some people to subscribe to me and my videos if yall wouldnt mind I show everything that is crazy and rarely happens but somehow I make it happen all the time like in stand punt returns and instant kick returns and my favorite blitzing play which cause a fumble or sack bout 90 of the time I hope yall enjoy
GameSack Ghost House in Brazil was reeskined as a Chapulin Colorado game haha
GameSack In the next Gaming on Halloween, you should play Koudelka and the Shadow Hearts series. Those are HEAVILY horror themed RPGs.
GameSack You should definitely check out Enemy Zero... its not quite as bad as D, and it has some interesting FPSlike segments that are pretty good for a Saturn game.
GameSack YOU LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAD!
GameSack You guys have great t shirts
GameSack Whats the ending song?
GameSack D was originality on the 3DO in 1994
GameSack Another superb episode guys. One question though which of you owns the black cat in the intro?
GameSack I dont need to know which dracula I am to be a dracula.
GameSack Hello friends I would like to see in the next episode, onimusha series, fatal frame, project blair witch (pc) and the slenderman the arrival )
GameSack oh man im so happy you brought up otogi. i played the crap out of that game in high school. Ive been needing to get myself an xbox so i can play those again.
GameSack You didnt wash your hands after touching outside stuff OO, I imagine the next episode will correct this and have a new hand washing scene as per the previous Halloween 1 episode
GameSack That was fantastic! I concur with the Otagi recommendation. Those two games dont get another love. The King of Demons looked great also. Why didnt we get that over here gosh darn it?!?!?!
GameSack Enemy zero was cool. You cant see enemies. You use sound to find them. Very cool.
GameSack Really awesome setting you had for the videoexcellent fitting music choice, as well :)
GameSack So that Master System Card game is like the size of a large Word Document?
GameSack You guys release such great videos, which are far more informative than most youtube gaming channels. Keep up the good work!
GameSack I remember Mad Balls!
GameSack well i ended up picking up ghost house (cart version) very cool game thx guys :)
GameSack king of demons is an awesome game just like gs mikami i didnt think anybody knew of the games but me ah i guess thats a little selfish sounding
GameSack Fuckin A Madballs!That toy line had a surprisingly good quality cartoon, too.
GameSack how can you guys play in a forest?
GameSack What is the song playing at 7:48?
GameSack Tune in Next year for: Mario Doom, Starring Joe Redifer!
GameSack I used to have ghost house on cartridge, i loved it! hunting vampires was so fun :D
GameSack So thats what happened to Monterey Jack from Rescur Rangers...
GameSack If I could get a buck for every time the word colorful is used...
GameSack That short film at the end was 3spoopy5me
GameSack lol, that special Halloween movie was great! Just curious, how hard was it filming Dave running backwards? Definitely adds a sense of creepiness with how odd it looks in reverse!
GameSack i would have added the onimusha or resident evil series
GameSack Im sure someone else has already asked somewhere, but why mention D and Enemy Zero but not D2? I guess because you were talking about Saturn games in that portion and its Dreamcast? And I think Enemy Zero is worth a play, but it is a bit different. And has a weird saveload system if I remember right.
GameSack Great episode and great ending loved Daves face reaction. If I rember correctly Sega only made Deep Fear was due to the fact Capcom didnt put Resident Evil 2 on the Saturn. Even though Capcom had a planed released for RE2 on the Saturn Sega then killed off the Saturn and started working on the Dreamcast so Capcom just waited till the Dreamcast came out.
GameSack New episode of game sack!?! Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyeysyesyesyesyesyes!
GameSack Majyoouo or something like that. If you search for King of Demons Super Famicom youll find the proper spelling.
GameSack At least its a Sonic Doll and not a Tails Doll.
GameSack Acting backwords  as allways you create something original!,) Well done!
GameSack Great episode guys!!! I wanted to look that Super Famicom game you showcased. What was it called again ?
GameSack It was pretty easy for me. Might have been harder for Dave, though. We really had to go through the sequence of movements before each shot to make sure they were done in the correct order as Im sure Dave will attest.
GameSack Joe, I for one would really appreciate it if Enemy Zero was featured in an episode. I beat that game once in normal mode back in 99. It was a hybrid FMVFPS, but in some ways it was an antiFPS in that you couldnt blast willy nilly, you had 13 shots that you had to charge against an invisible enemy. I have played games less frustrating, but never a game that confounded expectations as much Also Why no D2? Maybe a Kenji Eno episode?
GameSack Awesome guys I wasnt even aware of some of those games. I have a soft spot for tnak controls and survivor horror games.
GameSack I thought Id mention to you... when I was in third grade, I went as Beetlejuice for Halloweener, the cartoon version (with the red shirt inside), rather than the movie one (white shirt inside).
GameSack Must be a damn good lay, that could explain a certain other character whos known for being kidnapped ....
GameSack One of my favorite horror games is Shivers by Sierra, which was released on the PC in 1995. Youre locked inside a haunted museum on a dare and in order to escape, you have to capture all the ghosts. Some of the puzzles are insanely tough and the atmosphere is genuinely creepy. Its definitely an underrated classic and its too bad it was never rereleased. A DS port would have been great. Im hoping it will show up on Steam, but someone has to remember it exists first.
GameSack Awesome guys I wasnt even aware of some of those games. I have a soft spot for tnak controls and survivor horror games.
GameSack Hey Dave. You forgot to mention that the PS3XBOX Splatterhouse has the original Arcade game to unlock, and also Splatterhouse 23. Now thats fan service!
GameSack I tried looking it up in gamefaqs but didnt find it
GameSack I appreciate the voice acting joke.

GameSack OH! That Deep Fear game looks real impressive. OH!
GameSack great games recommended here! awesome video as usual!
GameSack I swear I need to come over and hold you guys up at gun point forcing you to make more videos! Forget all this vacations and working and all that crazy crap! Just videos now!
GameSack You can clearly see that a lot of work is put into GameSack! Great work guys!
GameSack I wonder if you guys can do a Game Sack on some REALLY bad games, that they werent even licensed. Like Action 52.
GameSack was that persona 3 music at the beginning?
GameSack I really liked Demons on the PS3 and was able to beat it fairly quick. But there was something about Dark that didnt appeal to me so I never bothered to pick it up.
GameSack You know why the original Splatterhouse was great and the remake for PS3XBOX360 sucked?Its because the original was from Namco,but the remake was from Namcos biggest mistake.Namco Bandai.
GameSack Glad to hear other people enjoyed the new Splatter house,I thought it was really good for the most part. Nice list fellas
GameSack The creepy violins doing the Sega chant on the title card was a great touch :)
GameSack The voice over in the New Splatterhouse sounds like the voice of cat from catdog. Im guessing its probably the same guy but its just weird hearing that voice say some of the things it does since Im use to hearing it be a little more innocent.
GameSack I use Game Collector 5.2 Pro. Great program. :)
GameSack hahah awesome cat intro! X D
GameSack Another Halloween appropriate gem on the Master System is Vampire. Its a pretty decent Castlevania clone.
GameSack I must have somehow missed that episode, but that just means I get another fresh episode to watch!
GameSack That end movie was terrifying.
GameSack can someone please explain to me why splatterhouse 1 was never released on the mega drive but 2 and 3 where and why was 2 and 3 only released on the mega drive and not the arcades? its all a bit bizarre and silly if you ask me
GameSack another halloween classic!! cheers guys.
GameSack Because! The end parts are shot normally (and with a different camera) to show a difference between the two states of Dave.
GameSack Rick loves Jennifer because shes a HORROR! Bwa ha ha!
GameSack Found it!! It is Kurosus Theme from Persona 2, specifically the PSP remaster.
GameSack ok, its called Majyuuou and I guess I wont be buying it, its too damn expensive being a japanese game which are usually cheaper than english versions. the reproduction cartridge costs 50 and thats the cheapest copy there is
GameSack You can only hear the monsters approach in enemy zero as they are invisible. There will be a series of electronic beeps when a monster is near, and the beeps increase in frequency the closer they are to you. Really scary.
GameSack I remember seeing D in magazines. Looked so cool.
GameSack Dave you forgot to mention Splatterhouse was also released on FM Towns Marty.
GameSack Any time that diarrhea is brought up in an episode, you know it has been a good one!
GameSack Ahh, didnt see this before I posted... it does look like this is how theyve done it though! The movement has a subtle jagged, disjointed feeling to it. Very cool.
GameSack Ah Splatterhouse, one of my favorite series.
GameSack Did you guys film that with Dave walking backwards? The SUV door and the wood as well as the way Dave was walking looked a little funny looking.
GameSack NO!!!! DONT UPDATE!!!!! KEEP IT!!!!! I love it. Its like a ski lodge in there.
GameSack I dont know what creepypasta is but it sounds delicious.
GameSack Another great vid. Thx guys. Happy Halloween!
GameSack Thanks for noticing! :)
GameSack Thank you for a great episode :)
GameSack I always knew sonic was more badass than mario! Too bad he choose the chucky route ..
GameSack all 3 are on mega drive
GameSack Nice video. Now would you kindly work on episode 22, why I go off to watch episode 21 and would you kindly upgrade something more then your gun, maybe the telekinesis or winter blast.
GameSack how did you actually get your name?
GameSack Not done watching but epic so fare :D
GameSack Awesome, thank you! I really wanted to get these put up early, but at this point Im just glad I was able to put them up today at all. :D
GameSack Epic episode bro Loved it one to the next one :D
GameSack Also I know its completely random but have you guys ever thought about doing a super hero game comparison video? Like Marvel vs Dc and see which side had the better overall games.
GameSack Cool, ill be sure to check that Facebook page out and start spreading the news. And i respect you for not whoring out by begging for subscriptions. On the other hand, i really want you guys to get more exposure... maybe even get a partnership with Youtube so you can get some revenue, and maybe... just maybe youll go back to doing 1 episodes a week! I know you put a lot effort into editing and actually playing the games before each episode, but god dammit... 2 episodes a month is not enough!!
GameSack Thanks! We do have a Facebook and Twitter. If you check out the Game Sack Episode guide linked to on every description it lists all that at the top of the page. I dont really think that reminding people to subscribe at the end of the video would help at all. I would rather our viewers be smart enough to figure out that one on their own. :) But yeah we suck at PR. We dont whore ourselves out there and mostly rely on word of mouth (aka you guys) and weve been pretty happy with that so far.
GameSack Yeah I didnt believe I did any of that stuff until Joe rolled the film. I said Is that me? Shit!
GameSack LOL that was awesome.
GameSack Aaaahhh! My colons empty now! lol
GameSack This one is a parody of those old Silent eras of Horror Movies. :D
GameSack Amazing video. Ive been watching you guys since the start and it seems like the quality is getting better every video!
GameSack You guys really deserve a whole lot more than 30.000 views per video. Not that 30 000 is bad at all, but its quite unsettling when a show as well produced as yours only gets 30 000, while lazily put together crap like Pewdiepie gets millions of view. I know it isnt your style, but you guys should really put more effort in PR. Make a facebook page, and a twitter page. End every video with dont forget to subsribe. Do what is necessary to get your awesome show out there. You deserve more.
GameSack This is REALLY cool!!! Lots of great visual ideas and the stop motion stuff is insanely good!!!
GameSack Nice movie. You guys could really pull of a remake of Peter Gabriels Sledgehammer! :)
GameSack The classic above all classics XD Thanks for making this its own video :)
GameSack Gamesack is the reason why I have Youtube! )
GameSack Dave, odd question but do you play soccer? I kept looking at your shoes lol
GameSack You guys really like stop motion...
GameSack Cool vid! How long did it take to make?
GameSack I immediately recognized the music from haunting grounds. Or atleast i think it is if not then this post just got awkward but im pretty sure it is so kudos to you.
GameSack Whats scary is that Dave rides dirty!
GameSack The Benny Hill theme music would have been great during this video
GameSack Awesome, videos like this plus the awesome reviews are the reason why I am subscribed to this channel.
GameSack You guys really like stopmotion huh? Well done
GameSack Read the description. :)
GameSack Thats the music from Haunting Ground, isnt it?
GameSack your basement looks much more inviting now than it did in 2001
GameSack Thanks! There always fun to make. Although I cant speak for Joe as he has the hard part.
GameSack makes me wonder if there was a conversation about including a stopmotion turd in this video
GameSack Nice really like the old silent era style. Dave magically hovering up the stairs at the end was pretty good to along with the carpet roll up.
GameSack I know this is supposed to be a silly video, but the repetitive sound effect in the background reminds me of Begotten, therefore making this video way more unsettling by association.
GameSack You know what happens when you build a house on a graveyard
GameSack I hope you do not have to make too much takes because of theses
GameSack great start for haloween season... Besides, 6 people never went out to that haunted house
GameSack awesome... joe, your basement sure has come a long way. How long ago was this filmed?
GameSack Dave hasnt changed much!
GameSack WOW! nice! Thanks for putting this up!
GameSack Yes! Well I used to play a lot both indoor and out.
GameSack Do a Kickstarter for the BluRay Authoring programs required.
GameSack I know the first thing I do when I enter a haunted house is take a poop.
GameSack Joe and Dave you so CRAZAY!!!!
GameSack Joe have you played any of the pikmin games? Im playing pikmin 3 right now...totally underrated series in the US i think,
GameSack Loved it guys ...waz awsome and alot of fun! :)
GameSack Im never getting that 2:36 back, am I?
GameSack Alternate ending is better :)
GameSack Thats awesome! I had a feeling lol. me too :)
GameSack Lol i love you guys! This is funny! Keep it up :)
GameSack next time ill just read the description...
GameSack Good job! I like... hahaha..
GameSack Wow, what a great little video! Those stop motion sequences must have taken a while, but they look really awesome!
GameSack Dave didnt wipe his butt after pooping. Gross, thats how you get hemorrhoids.
GameSack BRILLIANT!!! I swear  this is actually more scary than the modern so called horror games companies put out nowadays! They could really learn a thing or two from you guys! and I am being serious!! I especially thought the background soundtrack was especially creepy and spooky  something you never even see in horror games nowadays. hell  most horror games of today rarely even use a soundtrack and instead opt for complete silence which i think is fucking retarded and not scary at all.
GameSack New(ish) stuff from Game Sack and its not even Sunday... feels more like Christmas than Halloween! :)
GameSack I think our upcoming Halloween episode end skit is even better. less than a week before its up!
GameSack Hmmm...this movie could have used a chic with bug tits walking around naked...like having antenna s coming out and shit
GameSack This channel is a hidden gem on YouTube you need more subs get your channel out there more!
GameSack i cant wait for your next halloween episode, i can see you put a lot of effort in your videos.
GameSack Havent you guys already posted that earlier?
GameSack Yes and forced me to play until I beat it. Oh the humanity!!
GameSack Everything you guys post is worth watching, Waiting extra week between shows hurts, but worth it.
GameSack Its pretty funny, your average video views are on par with your subscriber count. Maybe when you dont beg for subscriptions, you actually get a proportionate ratio like that?
GameSack Im not sure what I just watched but it was entertaining.
GameSack Also can we get this on like blu ray or dvd to buy episodes. Your episodes are so long I literally prefer watching it as traditional tv show.
GameSack Dave forgot to wipe and wash his hands! I remember this from a year ago when people complained. Great skit!
GameSack Have you guys ever talked about Blue Stinger? I dont remember seeing it on the show. If its not featuring this Halloween, maybe show it next year. Keep up the good work guys. Cant wait for the new Halloween episode.
GameSack this reminds me of the haunting starring polterguy
GameSack I really enjoyed the carpet rollup scene. Excellent editing as always!
GameSack great video! would definitely like to see some more of it!!
GameSack Whats going to be scary is the laundry, No wipe.
GameSack Now I know youre last names! Once I get hold of a Denver phone book I can find out where you live...
GameSack This was done in 2001? He doesnt look like he aged at all since then.
GameSack Trivia: The room with the falling ceiling tiles and the rolled up carpet is where we currently make Game Sack.
GameSack AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Brilliant video. Happy Halloween Joe and Dave!
GameSack A partition for the crapper and a finished basement? Haunted or not Im interested in the current market value of his home!
GameSack GameSack. Best show on the internet.
GameSack Not even quite sure what to say about this one
GameSack Good thing I just smoked a bomber before I watched this. Lol
GameSack The reviewer never liked Doom or Mortal Kombat? ...you review 90s video games..you dont have be a fanboy..but to have no interest in 2 of the largest franchises in 90s gaming seems odd..it feels like my dad from when i was a teen doing a video game review show...
GameSack The actual arcade version of Star Wars Arcade was much, much better, with a faster and more stable framefrate, better graphics, and a bigger screen, its a much easier experience than the 32X version
GameSack Why was this System even released? at the time I thought that the mid90s were going to be about the Saturn. Its like Sega wanted to fail.And as someone who actually had a SCD Drive. I can tell you that it was a POS! it was slow, to load the Games were more expensive then the Cartridge ONLY Games, and offered next to nothing over them bar some really crappy (if only somewhat impressive) FMVs in the early 90s.
GameSack man this guy really doesnt like a lot of games, and his because he doesnt like them he puts no effort, not really something thats going to make me a fan of this channel. later gaters
GameSack I love Shadow Squadron and Space Harrier. The rest of the 32x library can go suck it.
GameSack Rubbish review or Mortal Combat 2. Its my favourite game on the 32x and the best version of Mortal Kombat 2. Only the Saturn version has better Graphics but I prefer the 32x version as it has no loading times.
GameSack I dont own one now, traded it in for a Panasonic 3DO years ago. I love my still fully working 3DO but miss my 32X and keep intending to repurchase one. I can definitely recommend it, especially for classic arcade games like Virtua RacerFighter, Kolibri and totally arcade perfect Space Harrier and After Burner. It had more good games than people think. In an interesting note I own a slightly suspicious version of DarXide on Nokias Ngage QD. A perfect conversion, and yes, I did originally own the 32X version and never had a problem beating the first level. I guess you just suck! Lol!!
GameSack Start reviewing different kinds of shelled seeds so you can call the show Nut Sack
GameSack theWatchingDog I never cared for those early Doom or Wolfenstein games either but I loved Mortal Kombat so to each their own I guess..
GameSack I just want to say thank you and that I appreciate this review. When I saw the title, I didnt actually expect you guys to literally cover all the games for this system.
GameSack Akhbar sounds like hes from the Bronx. Perfect.
GameSack I really like that racing game. It makes me feel like Im back in a 1990s arcade.
GameSack Lol the ending is great :D
GameSack Nice vid guys!! Good times, I only got the 32x a few years ago and I love it for its qwerkiness lol, check out my channel if you get the chance, Ive made a few vids about my trials and tribulations with the nightmare that is the 32x
GameSack dudes ur too hard on the system.
GameSack i really like that you guys show unique games for each system.there where almost 1 or 2 games which i have i barely heard or seen for the system.
GameSack Wow, Darxide looks like a Playstation game!
GameSack I had a 32x and it didnt need the power source or all the cables atleast i dont remember it needing all that and i loved it had star wars arcade virtua fighter and virtua racing, and after burner and primal rage loved all but primal rage that game sucked lol
GameSack Master system  System 16 Genesis  System 3232x  Model 1Saturn  Model 2 and Model 3Dreamcast  Naomi
GameSack doom is only really good on the pc. it fucking rules on the pc in fact. what with all the mods and all.
GameSack gamers who dont like mortal kombat and doom wtf!!
GameSack Why u dont have episode about 3DO?
GameSack Its good to see someone not praising Mortal Kombat for a change. Usually I hear that its the king of the fighting genre. Its a good game, easy to play and fun in multiplayer... but really, Street Fighter is waaay better.
GameSack Haha. In every episode, this dude cares about the music more than any other aspect to the game. Makes no sense
GameSack Im so glad Im not the only one that actually like Knuckles Chaotic very much. Sad that my Sega Genesis and 32X doesnt work anymore.
GameSack So the best Sega could muster was a 150 equivalent of the sfx chip? What a piece of trash.
GameSack 16:57 WOAH! Do not tell me that no one else whos played Sonic  AllStars Racing Transformed didnt recognize this music, for it had been remixed for the Race of Ages course! Wow, I thought that music was original not that Im disappointed, Sega is known for amazing music!
GameSack A decent port of Daytona USA on the 32x wouldve had me sold.
GameSack I got a 32X in 1997 (actually it was one of my first online purchases), and love it, even if some of the games available for it are mediocre. Even those had their charm, like Cosmic Carnage, which was a scifi Art of Fighting knockoff. Highly underrated addon . Im 34 of the way to owning a complete library.
GameSack 3 good games that you can play in the 32x jajajaja
GameSack 7:07 they did have a proper sonic game that was a prototype for knuckles chaotixSonic Crackers  Knuckles Chaotix
GameSack 32X Space Harrier and AfterBurner with the Genistick controller is arcade heaven for me, and reason enough to never sell my 32X
GameSack So FIFA, MK 2  Primal Rage dont appeal to you but a snooze fest like Star Trek does?
GameSack The virtural boy had a mostly good library. I dont care what the system was capable of, the games were fun
GameSack Im pretty sure you can press mode or something to get the 32x to go full screen. Im almost certain I did that as a kid, but everyone now says its windowed and thats it. So strange...
GameSack I don t see anything bad about cosmic carnage it seens like a competent fighter
GameSack Long live Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf.
GameSack Still waiting for a dedicated Sega Genesis episode.
GameSack Was considering picking up the 32X but I think I might pass on it now that Ive seen what it has to offer. Unless I find it for dirt cheap then Hell Yeah!
GameSack 32x looks awesome :) i wish i could get one :(
GameSack I gave knuckles chaotix a chance and i am so glad i did. I find there isnt much wrong with it. I think its a solid game and its worth a remake
GameSack If i understand, since you suck at those game than the 32x suck?...
GameSack Hm.. PC Engine Afterburner doesnt look much different in my opinion.
GameSack 7:20 Virtua Racing Deluxe
GameSack Which of you is the animator?
GameSack Call me crazy but .. I liked the Sega 32X
GameSack did you ever play Shadow Squadron in 2 player? if you had hen that segment would have been longer, and really.. its the only game the 32x needed. go play the rom and grab a friend. the best coop experience that had been released on any console and it took a couple years to see anything come on the market that could deliver as solid a 2p expirience
GameSack the Space Harrier remains me 3d Wolrd Runner for the Nes! XD
GameSack Very helpful video. I recently purchased a 32x and this made it much easier to determine which games would be worth purchasing. I might have never bought Kolibri if it wasnt for this video. Thanks.
GameSack 31:15 I have one of those PCs
GameSack One of Segas biggest failures of all time!Believe it or not, both Sega CD and 32X suckedass big time!The games were bad, the quality is shit and it required several cords just to operate it! Fucking hell Sega!
GameSack Forget Doom, its all about Wolfenstein!
GameSack The 3rd one broke, i said fuck it  bought a PlayStation. Best move
GameSack DE HE JUST SAY THE SNES VERSION OF MORTAL KOMBAT IS BETTER THAN GENESIS VERSION? I WANT BLOOD DAMMIT!
GameSack I want Daves shirt. Star Trek: Starfleet Academy is fn awesome.
GameSack lol, virtual boy is way better than 32x, VB Wario Land alone is better than any game on 32x.
GameSack I had 3 of these pieces of shit when it came out. By the time g
GameSack I never heard of the 32 X still this video.
GameSack Fahrenheit? Wow, I thought that theres only one Farhenheit (or Indino Prophecy somewhere else)
GameSack The amount of cables and plug sockets needed to make the 32X and Mega CD work is crazy. The amount of mess behind the machine is insane, i would be afraid a fire might break out if left plugged in over night. Looking at the PS3 or any other modern console shows how things have moved on.
GameSack Do give the saturn sequel to Tempo a try... its deliciously bizarre. Comedy gold for your show.
GameSack Ah SEGA my FavouriTe c0mPANY of the GAMES!
GameSack no jokes for 36 great holes?
GameSack I heart game sack. You guys are more in depth than most reviewers. And I think the show has gotten a lot better through the years.
GameSack okay, i have the 32 x and thought the games are bad except for a few i have to ask this one question why? my hypothesis is that no body gave it a chance, which is really sad because now i wonder what couldve became of this system...i mean i ow i will neer know but seriously, why? I admit i was neer a sega fan but after buying this with spider man, doom and knuckles chaotix (reason why i bought the lot) asked me why? Joe, i know you dont answer questions but maybe you help me being a sega fan boy and all...(sorry if i sound like i am begging but i am just damn curious)
GameSack 32x is the coolest retro console in the world!!!! NOT!!! LMAO Piece of st
GameSack sega suck the 32x suck. it was nothing but a somewhat high end 16bit system. sega took people hard earn money and went to the bank laughing. psone is a real 32bit system. snes is a real 16bit system that full of gimmicks. they tried to gain back fanboys trust with the saturn but psone shut that down.sega was always half doing it with their systems and the dreamcast was a bit to late when the real 128bit systems got release.
GameSack The guy in the left looks hi as hell!
GameSack I think this system needed ports with better graphics and sound. Also a strong line up of original games. Capt. Obvious here.
GameSack Y the fuck! We covered this like 20yrs ago. Really? Find something else to do or talk about! LAME...
GameSack I take that back, the Sega CD library is good, and I like it. Its suffering from some games like night trap and marky mark and the funky bunch make my video.
GameSack Cool effect in the end credits? Was that an AE template?
GameSack This is one of my favorite channels on YouTube.
GameSack that golf game reminds me of lee carvaleos putting challenge from the simpsons
GameSack there was literally one game on here worth playing and that was After Burner. I already owned Mortal Kombat and NBA JAM TE on my Sega Genesis so there was no reason to buy this system
GameSack Huh...thought they released a looney tunes game about taz on the 32.
GameSack Yes, better graphics, but v.r. deluxe doesnt have visual damage like the original v.r.!
GameSack I think the only reason to own a 32x is Space Harrier... (And maybe Virtua Racing)
GameSack Who came up with the intro music? Where is it from? Its real catchy in a way and easy to listen to. Would be perfect as a soundtrack in a game
GameSack I had a 32X and I will never regret it!
GameSack I just say Angry Video Game Nerd, all the way )(He got so popular.. his work is everywhere :D)
GameSack If they had released Knuckles Chaotix on the Genesis or Saturn it wouldnt have been forgotten like it was.
GameSack Thats another way of doing what I suggested a while back X3
GameSack If you go left in the secret entrance instead of going right, you can get to the platform with the badge you saw in the room where you met Punio.
GameSack Ah a good dose of Kakujo and Narun. Always nice.
GameSack I loved Ristar back then and was so hoping for a sequel. The voice samples never bothered me.
GameSack 1:30 is that a dick i see coming out of the ground...
GameSack I for one would love to see a third Act Raiser.
GameSack Ristar being a game that time forgot is a bit debatable since it was includedin the Genesis Collection for PS3 and XBox.
GameSack These Saturn, Sega CD games glorified on this channel look horrible
GameSack the mark of kri was an awesome game
GameSack When is there going to be a new damn Dantes Inferno.
GameSack yep, crash racing for the ps2 was meh compared to the great crash racing for the ps1.....
GameSack I looooved Ristar! I remember beating it back in the day, it was aawwweesome xDI dont think the voices were bad, they made him sound like an Alien which he is.And the spinny thingies were fun as hell, I really loved those too. Took some time to master maybe but when you got good they were just awesome.
GameSack They did an amazing job with the graphics on Ristar. For the Genesis having a limited color pallet, the game gives you the illusion that the Genesis has a color pallet comparable to the SNES and the PC Engine unless with later Genesis games they put extra chips in the cartridges to give the games more colors. I dont know but later Genesis games look awesome.
GameSack 19:38 Actually, Nintendo did make a shooter before Solar Striker. It was an arcade game called Radarscope, and it was a huge bomb. After that, Nintendo brought in Shigeru Miyamoto to make a new game with the same hardware. That game was Donkey Kong.
GameSack lol at the AtGames Master System. XD
GameSack If I had to say one of my personal favorite games time forgot, Id say Segas Virtual ON series. Its a series of high speed, Japanese 3D mech fighting games with some of the best music youll ever hear (especially when you play the Dreamcast version) But word of advice: Stay FAR AWAY from Virtual On Marz on PS2. (unless you live in Japan  The localization team absolutely BUTCHERED the American version, screwing with the enemy AI, and even removing whole game features, namely the highly requested Database mode.)
GameSack hmmm, that Atgames Master System is not real. Would be nice tough.
GameSack Nights. Hes only ever had 2 games, both of those stories being extremely lackluster, but the game series really does have good potential.
GameSack I LOVED Uniracers back in the day!!!D:robblerobblerobble...
GameSack I got MY copy of Solar Striker when we went on vacation in Florida too! I thought I was the only person who knew that game.
GameSack jazz jackrabbit , crash bandicoot my fav childhood games
GameSack I enjoyed Ristar on my Game Gear. The game is the same, just the graphics are dialed back a bit and the music has that 8 bit tone. Definitely one of the top games to own on the Game Gear.
GameSack Ristar is one of my ALLTIME FAVOURITES!!! The fact that they never released a sequel is a sin! I always imagined a tiein with Sonic of some sort.
GameSack I have Uniracers still!
GameSack This is the loudest ive laughed at the post credits scene. Fantastic! Epic timing and Daves face is priceless
GameSack Uniracers got a lot of play from me back in the day. I thought it was pretty neat. Also, the bike in Stunt Race FX is where the speed is at.
GameSack People always seem to mention when a games sound is so Genesis or So Turbo and never Nintendo but man for me Stunt Race FX has a veeeeery distinct SNES sound. Its definitivestandard. Which isnt bad, by any means.
GameSack HEY! BACK OFF NOCTURNUS IN THE NIGHT! I LIKE THAT VERSION MORE THAN SYMPHONY OF THE NIGHT!
GameSack You didnt mention Haunting: Starring Polterguy for the Genesis! Thats a shame, because that game really, really deserves more attention. Ive never played, seen, or even heard of any game thats even remotely like it, with the exception of an internet flash game that was clearly inspired by it. You guys absolutely must check it out if youre not familiar with it. You have to run around a house possessing furniture and other things, in order to scare a family out of their home. Damn near every single thing can be possessed, and everything you do possess has its own unique(and often times humorous) animation. The only thing bad about the game is fighting the final boss. If you ever play though it sometime, youll know what I mean.
GameSack Perfect Dark for N64 needs a sequel.
GameSack Since the PS3, 360, and Wii are now considered retro consoles, can you please review more hidden gems and games that time forgot for the games on these systems?
GameSack I read somewhere Ristar was originally going to be a Sonic game.. Any truth in this..?
GameSack Landstalker on the Sega Genesis
GameSack How come Dave never really gets to talk about the games?
GameSack Gex and Gex 2 were kinda forgotten
GameSack The 7th Saga by Enix on SNES is the best RPG Ive played that never caught on. You select one of seven characters  the whole game youre competing with your six rivals to get Runes. Mode7 battles as well.
GameSack Wait, a Master System emulator console that charges 50 a game? Did I hear that right???
GameSack A game that desperately needs to be remade is Blast Corps for the N64. That game was so much fun, and would be even more incredible on a modern console
GameSack Love Crash Team Racing. Many fun hours spent racing friends on it.
GameSack Crash Team Racing sortve had 2 sequels. Crash Nitro Kart on the Ps2, and Crash Tag Team Racing on the Ps2, Xbox, Gamecube, and PSP. Oh, and whatever happened to the bonanza bros.?
GameSack mischief makers deserves a reboot. Such a quirky fun game. A 3d rendered, 2d platform game. Its great!! Id like to see the metal max series in English over here since the only game thats been in english is metal saga.
GameSack I really really like CTR.
GameSack U guys should do a Launch Titles  best and worst episode. I dont remember ever seeing a video on that. I think that could be a great episode
GameSack I was very surprised to see Crash Team Racing here on this list, it got rave reviews, it got great sales and people still love it today. And it actually did get a sequel Crash Nitro Cart (although it wasnt made by Naughty Dog). It definitely should not be on a forgotten games list
GameSack How different would the game be if Ristar was ten million degrees at the surface?
GameSack whats with all the violet in Saturn games
GameSack I have a couple more suggestions if you plan on making another episode like this.Monster Bash (PCDOS) , Diddy Kong Racing (N64), Wave Race (N64), ExtremeG (N64), Target Earth (Genesis), ReVolt (MultiPlat), Tai Fu: Wrath of the Tiger (PS1). Some of these games were ported around or remade but Im not aware of any direct sequels.
GameSack 50 fucking bucks for PowerStrike thats a rip off I would be pissed if that was me buying it
GameSack Stunt Race FX owned so much. Hearing the sound effects is so nostalgic.Thanks for another great episode Game Sack dudes
GameSack I love Crash Team Racing! Me and my mom would play it all the time when I was a kid. I actually prefer it over Mario Kart to be honest.
GameSack finally somebody gives the mark of kri some love
GameSack I loved Ristar, too. My kids still play it. Always thought it was pronounced R(eye)star, like rye bread...
GameSack I will never forget CTR!
GameSack I miss maximo I think thats how its spelled lol
GameSack LOL  1:30.... Its pretty deep in that hole.
GameSack Just remembered a few more Vectorman, Aero the AcroBat  Bubsy. I also remember Blasto being advertised pretty extensively by Sony for the Playstation.
GameSack Katanari Damaci for play station 2, LSD for play station 1, bust a groove for play station, syphon filter for playstation. and some others i cant quite remember right now.
GameSack Where the heck do you guys get all your awesome shirts? Are they custom made?
GameSack CTR should NOT be on this list.
GameSack I really wanted another Mischief Makers. Loved it as a kid. Also I want another Skies of Arcadia
GameSack Am I the only one that thinks the space ship at 1:30 looks like a penis?
GameSack Aw, no Pulseman?Oh well, its cool to see Ristar again.
GameSack Woo, Mark of Kri was one of my favorite ps2 games.
GameSack Im honestly surprised that almost everyone here didnt know that Ristar was made by Sonic Team, the people who make the Sonic games.
GameSack Nice to see Solar Striker get some attention i enjoy playing through it on occasion and i love the soundtrack to it. I kinda wished Nintendo made a sequel to it.
GameSack Do Evil Zone sometimes 3
GameSack Mark of Kri was an awesome game.
GameSack Actually nintendos first arcade game that went to america was a space shooter
GameSack I played Ristar on the Sega Channel. Loved it. Also loved the Sega Channel.
GameSack Great job guys!I always enjoy your videos.
GameSack Call me crazy but Cyborg Justice and Tobal 2 should have gotten more play.
GameSack I love the targeting controls in Mark of Kri.
GameSack FINALLY!!! someone talks about The Mark Of Kri and how fantastic it is!!
GameSack Thumbs up for Ristar, I liked that game (despite his voice).
GameSack Xexyz, Captain Skyhawk, Kid Chameleon, and Jackie Chans Action Kung Fu were all great games that needed more love. Id put music from JCAKF on mega man level of awesome.
GameSack One of my favourite consoles is the Original Xbox because its a lot of fun collecting the really good games that Microsoft just through away because Halo happened to be a smash hit. Microsoft you suck, bring back Stubs The Zombie, Voodoo Vince, Otogi, Phantom Dust, Brute Force and many more.
GameSack Tak and the power of juju
GameSack Wacky Races  Dreamcast
GameSack Surprised you didnt mention Crash Nitro Kart, the sequel to Crash Team Racing. Its not as good, but it was still pretty fun back in the day. Also, Bravoman appeared in Namco X Capcom, for some reason.
GameSack Mercenary on the C64.
GameSack Solar Striker is a total ripoff of Zanac!
GameSack Awww, Uniracers was always a guilty pleasure of mine and I actually got pretty darn good at it. A friend and I used to play it quite often. I never knew about the lawsuit though, pretty interesting!
GameSack antz is good whats your problem!
GameSack avgn thought the boy got kidnapped
GameSack at least Bravoman have a cool webcomic from Shiftylook
GameSack what is that song during the credits?
GameSack I love this game but its too hard
GameSack its weird because they took the blinking lights out when you died because it was believed to cause seizures so it became a solid red background and then the fade in.
GameSack Nice gameplay, man. I actually dig this game a lot despite the bad press it gets.
GameSack !!!PLEASE READ!!! Did you say You play the green Zelda? And how is he like Mario?
GameSack How this game working out for you. I really need to jump on it and check it out. I loved the old ones
GameSack dude your audio quality (commentary wise voice) is so much better and clearer, bit further away from your mouth and it will be perfection! Alternatively loving the Skyrim serious dude, keep up the great work, also nearly 900 subs!
GameSack You are a great youtuber and you deserve that 1000 subscribers
GameSack I like the old mic better. This one you hear alot of wind blowing
GameSack Why did someone disliked the vid :(
GameSack Hi Friends,Enjoy the pictorial illustration of History and lore of Game of thrones, and this is about The Sack Of Kings Landing in House Baratheons Perspective

GameSack thanks man go dolphins and to the other dolphin fans on youtube
GameSack Ima destroy this dude in hate week LOL
GameSack It doesnt matter if its a laptop, tablet, desktop (which seems to be what you have), iPhone, those links wouldve worked lol. If you need it, ask man and I can hook you up so you can watch the game. It drives me nuts when I have to hear it, I want to see the action lol.
GameSack I think Cam Wake is healthy now. Lol.
GameSack Dolphins fan Tell my coffin slams

GameSack I love your videos that make my day

GameSack They make my day I mean

GameSack Lewis I have minecraft so we can play YAAAAY
GameSack amazing ur the best lewis
GameSack hey lewis u should play more black ops 2 that is halaroius as halo 4!!
GameSack Sam . . . suck my balls you cunt.
GameSack Sam more qualified to talk about coach driving than football.
GameSack Andys right on the money.Cardiff are so lucky to have Solskjaer. Theyll probably end up finishing higher than United....
GameSack Hahahahaha the accent is magically hilarious!!!!
GameSack The best players dont like playing for Moyes, The worst players like playing for Moyes..How the fuck has Clev got a start every sodding game? Jeez.
GameSack Moyseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! rooneeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! dont careeee.
GameSack Might be too inebriated for logic. Haha, Van Persie with a history of injuries now gets injured by the fitness regiment? Genius. Everton players didnt bitch and moan about a intense fitness program. How come cleverly wasnt let go a season or two seasons ago? I also remember getting beat 61 at home by Man City, a result which wouldve gotten moyes fired most likely. We also beat Liverpool at home this season as well... Give him the players he wants, spend a convincing amount of smart money in this season and the next and if he cant deliver champions league football next year hes done. Stopping pinning all the past failures of Fergie and the board on Moyes. The tactics need to change but there is more than one person to blame chaps.
GameSack Give this guy the utd job. He is so enthusiastic about it
GameSack way to early to sack him.
GameSack Moyes seems like a good lad, a TOO good lad. He is not tough enough at the moment. He is still taking all this crap from the fans and the board, the players... By the end of the game, when he was shouting: Go for it, all out!, no one really seemed that determined. I say the problem is with the players who think they know better. There is a communication problem, and some players are acting like such hot shots that it makes me angry. Moyes needs to start screaming, and showing everyone at Utd who is the Boss. If he cant do that, then he is wasting himself at this job. The diving, the fouls and the discipline issue.... Something needs to be done.
GameSack Sack the shite out of Moyes! Sam Allardyce is the man!
GameSack 100 Right...Moyes should be informed in no uncertain terms to fuckoff and never be allowed anywhere near Old Trafford or Carrington again. Im totally sick of the site of him. He should be ashamed..5m a year..Incompetent and substandard.
GameSack Is this Mr Tate in disguise?
GameSack Haha Sir Andy Tate called it.
GameSack This guy was fecking right. Sack him, give it to Giggs in the end.
GameSack I love Mancunians. I travelled with some for Holiday, just listening them to argue is hilarious.
GameSack giggs aint got his badges yet lad. lol
GameSack ...HA HA HA, you Red Devilz HAVENT Got the VAVAVOOM !!!
GameSack I love this guy rage )
GameSack A monkey in a suit could do a better job. This guy is off his head lmao.
GameSack Look just dont blame Moyes for this okay a swansea player injured rio, Moyes have no choice what to do so he brought fabio on, he did not know the red was going to happen and another thing Buttner is a Man Utd future no point of selling him he is the next Patrice Evra. Oh yeah the only thing that can save Man Utd is to find the next Cantona.
GameSack Well, well. Look who was absolutely spot on: You can sack him and give it to Giggsy for the rest of the season. Indeed. FTD, BRING BACK ANDY TATE.
GameSack Roy Keane even today, would play with more fight and spirit than some of the players did against SwanseaPlay for the badge FFS, its a privilege, too many okay players in this squad not enough great ones
GameSack This guy is prick and its sad to see so much support for him.Maybe they werent wrong with saying that United fans are gloryhunters after all...
GameSack look there are only two managers at the moment that i would want because of their style and strength of football and that jurgen Klop and roberto martinez, neither of which will happen
GameSack This guy should be a regular on the show. Hes hilarious and is brutally honest about the inconsistency of Man U.
GameSack Fergie left us 11 points clear of 2nd, champions winning 29 out of 38 games. He hands over to Moyes and we are 7th and out the cup in January. How is Fergie to blame?
GameSack I love this guy plz does anyone know his twitter
GameSack Give it to Giggsy till the end of the season. Possibly the worst suggestion I have heard all season. I hate people who boo, what good does booing do lmao if we could sing as loud as we boo maybe the players would waken up during the match. As much as I wanted him to succeed, its Moyes out for me but I wont stop supporting the team I love.
GameSack STAND BY YOUR NEW MANAGER. Fergie
GameSack Hahahaha...oh, my word. Speaking on behalf of the rest of English football fans...I fucking love this.
GameSack Listen to this guy, put me in charge
GameSack Moyes is crap better sign Reus in january
GameSack Hes not gonna get sacked. But even if he does get sacked. Get KLOPP KLOPP KLOPP KLOPP KLOPP KLOPP!! Klopp has 48 winning avg and 245 goal difference from just 244 games. thats pretty good for a coach of his age. Hes gonna bring back the winning mentality.
GameSack Giggs has the passion. Moyes doesnt give a shit
GameSack All you plastic fans who have been spoilt during our successful run in the 9000s need to hang up your half and half scalves and go support Chelsea. Manchester United have been, and always will be a successful club. It will take Moyes a few seasons before he can transition into creating his own team and eventually getting rid of the deadwood that Fergie left behind when he retired. In all fairness its these players that are under performing, not Moyes. Half of them dont want to play for the badge, with exceptions like Rooney and Januzaj.Its been half a season and all you see is people complaining, give Moyes time, after all Ferguson was called to be sacked after 3 seasons at United. And look what he did. Have Faith! GGMU!
GameSack give united to giggsy DDD
GameSack Let this man give the half time team talk!
GameSack Dont blame the training regime for van persies injury, Moyes is a professional football coach with a lot of experience.
GameSack He doesnt have enough class to be united manager he dont care about the vintage
GameSack Giggs  the chosen one..
GameSack I blame the players not the managers theres no creativity. They have talent but no belief in themselves.
GameSack Bttner was outstanding during that game, he was by far the best player on the pitch. He showed so much passion and he was the only player for United who wanted to win that game
GameSack Say what you want, this guy is a TRUE, Man United fan. Not some armchair fan, a pure Manc supporting his local club. respect
GameSack SO TRUE GET THAT GUY AS MANAGER
GameSack Lets keep the faith, were not Aston Villa yet, we dont sack managers and besides what could Sir Ryan of Giggs do? Bulb the canteen lady?
GameSack More from the great Andy Tate love this guy
GameSack U need to give him a chance guys remember fergie never won anything in his first two years at united
GameSack Please can we find this guys twitter account  I would love to read some of his thoughts
GameSack Its not just about Moyes. The team is just not good enough. Let Moyes sign some players so he can get his own team, not Fergies team. Every new manager wants his own players. Moyes is not an magician like Ferguson. Let the man build his own team, then the results will come. What Fergie did with this team was excellent. I gotta say. Im not an United fan, but what Fergie got out of the players was impressive.. Because, its not very impressive any more. Ferdinand is over the top. RvP is back with his usual injuries (Arsenal history), Rooney is great and he is the teams nr.1 at the moment. Carrick is good. Rafael is getting better. But on the other side of the defense you have Evra thats aging and getting bader and bader. This United team needs 2 or 3 new world class players that can go straight into the first team. A boxtobox mdifielder, attacker, and Central defender.
GameSack Sean said the same thing in his vid why does he receive hate?
GameSack moyes changed backroom staff that were loved by the players and brings in phil neville!? that is a fuck up of impressive magnitude....souness did same thing at pool in 90s... it fucked them up for 20 odd years
GameSack It happens to all teams look at Liverpool there only just getting back on track after being incredible.. and its just Manchester Uniteds turn.. 20 years or however many it has been is pretty good to maintain being the best team in England and many people would say the world.. So you know take it on the chin your still an incredible team with incredible support, hey if your glory fans give up who needs them you are true fans of a great team.. I support Sheffield United for god sake and that Tevez affair still haunts me when we got relegated from the Prem and look at where we are now.. But i accept that i still go games i still back my team no matter what.. Its hard to go from winning all the time to losing a few, but thats football you cant stay the best forever its just the turn that happens to near enough every team.
GameSack too many people overreacting to losses, many of them unlucky, and putting the players and the manager under too much pressure, we always needed the time to recover after losing the stability of having the most successful and influential manager ever.. the quality and potential is there as you saw last season, we dominated the league and won it by 11 points with more or less the same squad.. the players just need to gain some confidence back, maybe a fast creative midfield player who can hold up the ball as good as rooney can needs to be signed for a boost, but most of all we need certain talismen back from injuries that have come at an unfortunate time of the season eg. van persie, rooney, carrick.. get behind the team and stop acting like impatient, spoiled, entitled little bellends, united will turn it around like they always do
GameSack He is right about the players not caring, there is no passion on the pitch apart from the few being darren fletcher, welbeck, rooney, but other than that the team just dont go together, no one wants to win the game..
GameSack Legend. We have no idea how much in need we are of Klopp. I say let Giggs or Alex run till end of season and make Klopp the new manager end of season. But these Twats dont care about fans. Their concern is a retired man
GameSack Whats this guys twitter? Seriously, he knows his stuff. And he brings humour to it. Someone help me
GameSack Those who are against moyes, you are really impatient and seriously are glory hunters. Just because he lost 7 games or so doesnt mean hes shite, look how good he did with Everton with a shitty squad. He just needs to feel home at united, and with the support hes being given, thats never going to happen
GameSack What a clown this guy is typical plastic scummer
GameSack Moyes needs a chance at least until the end of the season. Where we end up by then is yet to be seen but he wont last long if this continues. Would be amazing to see a united legend take over though like Solskjaer or Cantona etc.
GameSack Moyes doesnt seem to care that the champions are seventh. We desperately need signings and moyes comes out with what a lot of us expected and said players arent available when they clearly are like coentrao, sneijder etc. clubs like chelsea and man city continue to strengthen while moyes says we arent buying anyone. Almost seems like the glazers are refusing to allow money to be spent on players and are just bleeding united dry. They dont know anything about football and dont care about the club
GameSack Go on Tate give em hell... Woodward s a clown. Moyes knew he was the manager before the summer and the pair of them failed to get anyone of note (Ill still give Fellaini a chance) but One whole transfer window and now the Jan windows been open 3 weeks and all thats happening is the scouser wants out... (we all know hes going) ......Sack of Cack the lot of them
GameSack 6 more years fatso , 6 more years. I am the Chosen One.
GameSack There will be no improvement under david moyes, how anyone actually could believe that a man whose only achievement elwas keeping everton a mid table team was gonna improve the champions is beyonf me. SACK HIM NOW B4 THE DAMAGE IS 2 MUCH 2 BE UNDONE
GameSack Hes right, the players dont care anymore.
GameSack i reeaaally hope moyes gets sackes next season so giggs can be our next manager
GameSack This guy couldnt be more right
GameSack giggs as united coach im not so sure but i bet the players would enjoy there football alot more and give him 100
GameSack United fans ask yourself this question did Fergie leave invest in young players or did he rely on an ageing squad to win the league? Now look at the mess.
GameSack LOL this guys a legend.
GameSack As a united fan from India who started supporting them after they were certain to win the bpl, I think either Moyes should stay so we keep losing or we get AVB a manager who knows what he is doing and spends money wisely especially Lamela (moyes should have smapped him up for manu). Im losing hope in moyes and this shit new united squad. I am considering changing to Arsenal, City or Chelsea to support depending on who wins da prem! AVBINMOYESOUT 20CHAMPIONS MANU4EVARRR GGMU GLORYHUNTER MOYES YOUTUBE BANTER TEAMINDIA INDIALOVESMANUANDFERGIE
GameSack Dont sack moyes plz he is too good for us Liverpool fans
GameSack van persaehhh tom clevelerlehhhh
GameSack The manager we should of got is now at Everton!
GameSack Im so sick of hearing Moyes Out. Just stick by the manager, look at SAF if we havent stuck by him we wouldnt be the club we are today. Just stick by Moyes and stop booing the bloody players.
GameSack I just realized it will be 10x as bad in the media if we get knocked out of the league cup too. With no signings in January... Moyes is about to age 10 years in 6 months...
GameSack this guy is 100 right, there is literally no flair and passion in our team but personally I am backing moyes till the end of the season because I think the players need to get behind him more but they cant if we dont have that winning mentality as we used to for the past 26 years...
GameSack Spot on, well said Andy
GameSack Is Gary Neville a possibility? Id love Klopp to leave germany!
GameSack Malaysian wsnker y dont he fuk off from a great history
GameSack i was there for atleast 30 mins

GameSack What a phenomenal tackle. This kid is an incredible athlete.
GameSack hey almightyapeman I played the lottery had to pic 6 s the jackpot was worth 656 million I hit 3 out of the 6 s if I would of just got the other 3 right I would be a millionaire tonight well the lottery story is true that really happened a few yrs ago when I played the mega millions the 656mill jackpot is still the largest jackpot in history I almost had a piece of the pie but my point is I didnt win an I didnt sit around an say oh if I would of just picked those other 3 s blah blah if I would of waited a tad bit longer maybe that would of changed things ect ect no I realized I didnt win the lottery so all that talk SEC is overstated if GA would of had better clock management they would of beat BAMA blah blah is old worn out garbage talk the SEC has won 7 straight still looking to win 8 straight then you wanna come around an say they are overrated? you dont accomplish that many victorys by luck son every last one of them was EARNED even if another conference won this season they still got a long ways to go before catching up to the SEC we are so far ahead of everyone else till it aint even funny I suggest you quit your crying an give credit where credit is due ROLL TIDE
GameSack Thats reminds me of the Sack Game against Auburn in 2005
GameSack Nick Marshall will be doing the same thing after the Iron Bowl. Auburn doesnt realize that Bama has the best rushing defense in the NATION, and the run will do absolutely nothing against them. Bama wins the Iron Bowl, and wins the NC.RTR
GameSack LSWHO LSWHO LSWHO LSWHO. Rolllllll tide!
GameSack Is that where he tore his ACL?
GameSack Awesome! Thanks for adding the quad sacks. Bama is kickin (I)! RMFT!!
GameSack This game we played different from any other game weve ever played. imo the best game in the second half ever under nick saban. sad to see mettenburger sacked 4xs but the tide was coming in and nothing gets in its way. Roll Tide Roll 2013 Nat. Champs!!!
GameSack Joey: hey I know you have been romped several times today and you are already nursing a knee injury and your O line has given up and its 4th and fifty and we need you to finish out the season but.....GO GET EM!
GameSack The SEC is overrated honestly. They refuse to play decent nonconference games, and theyre all at home. Then they get to bowl games and struggle with teams theyre supposed to beat handily. Like UGA against Nebraska last year, UGA would have beaten Bama if they knew how to manage the clock, and then they were behind Nebraska and only jumped ahead because of mental errors from Nebraskas offense...
GameSack hello my name is sack mettenberger
GameSack As a Alabama fan I say that was sad watch him crawl like a run over dog and the saddest part was none of him teammates checked on him or helped him up.
GameSack That crowd is going HAM....
GameSack Mettenberger was a drama queen. Anyone else notice him trotting off after the clock ran out? It looked like the Oline was punishing him. He better gain their respect again lmao
GameSack You have to give him credit for standing up after the sack and walking off that field like a man! lsu geauxtigers
GameSack Its War damn eagle you soft ass bitches!!!!
GameSack Did the LSU offensive line just quit all together?
GameSack Mettenberger is probably still pulling grass out of his teeth. Tough last 4 plays.
GameSack He just ignores his own lineman trying to help him. Mad respect for that
GameSack Id be scared shitless to play Alabama right now.
GameSack One of the greatest games Ive seen Bama play. We struggled in the first half but completely dominated the second half. The 4 sacks back to back, Mettenberger army crawling, TJ Yeldon and McCarron tearing LSU up and Nick Saban jumping into AJs arms!! 3PEAT RTR
GameSack PerryCuda You Funny LoL
GameSack Ive been looking for this great quality video. Thanks for posting.
GameSack Les Miles is slowly losing his mojo at LSU. Maybe a move to Texas or USC would do some good. He is weird, but I dont think he is an awful coach.
GameSack Gonna be funny when Bama loses to Auburn.
GameSack Was that road kill I saw
GameSack Saban must be some kind of autistic savant. He cant speak without moving his hands in rapid motion.
GameSack Hate to see that for Mettenberger...hope hes ok...I work in the city where he was born and raised...good kid...should have a nice NFL career.
GameSack Way to go Bana love watching our boys get this goofball
GameSack Mettenberger deserved every hit that he got on that series....loved it!! If youre gonna talk shit and give the fans taunting hand signals going into halftime then he deserves to be dragging his ass off the field. RTR!!!!
GameSack I agree with Gary. Good for Mettenberger to walk himself off. Roll Tide!
GameSack This should go down as the Quad Sacks. I love LOVE LOVE how Mettenberger looks like a slug after the fourth sack. The dude can barely stand!!! The perfect way to end the game.
GameSack RAMMER JAMMER BITCHES!!!
GameSack Sabin, Ive always stayed the whole game even when in the student section at LSU, whyd you have to leave for the gdamned Dolphins! LSU fans are stuck with Coach Miles who most certainly gives Les. The ass whoopings are getting worse each game. DAMN the football gods! Also, my respect for Zach soared after the 4th sac
GameSack Les Miles was a dick for leaving him in there on 4th and impossible. What a goon.
GameSack literally made his ass quit.
GameSack Gotta love how Gary thought Zack walking off was inspiring.I think it shows that Zack was going to go to great lengths to get the fuck off that field as fast as he could.
GameSack I was at this game and boy was this the most electrifying moment I have ever been a part of. You could FEEL the stadium brimming with energy that multiplied with each sack. at 1:50 when cyrus jones was getting wild that was the most wild I have ever been. Roll Tide
GameSack LOL Mett throwing his helmet.you just got PROCESSED
GameSack LSU was the better team this game and should have won handily. They knew LSU was going to throw the ball every time, of course you are going to get sacked more.
GameSack Les running a pass play on 4th in 28 down by more then 2 tds at the 2 minute mark in the 4th qtr. Then his qb gets hurt. What a ass hole.
GameSack Thanks for uploading this. Had been hunting it since the game ended.
GameSack LSWHO is down this year. so is the SEC which UAT and AUTURD are both PrEtENDERS. Missouri and the COCKS are JOKES too!!! The PAC12 is the strongest conference with the likes of STANFORD, Oregon, USC, and UCLA. FSU is number one by a MILE!!! FSU would kill any SEC PRETENDER TEAM this year.
GameSack wow we need to get rid of miles and replace the whole starting secondary. on the 55 yard td pass 10 men were playing man to man and jalen mills was playing zone. That is lack of awareness and prepariation. I give it up to the gumps for beating us.
GameSack True football the NCAA fuck the NFL
GameSack And thats him in the NFL. Ford is a good player. In the NFL they have the best of the best. We saw Ford do that to him...I cant imagine what manziel will do in the NFL....probably nothing.
GameSack My favorite playbyplay, this season, thus far, by Rod Bramlett  Stan White. War.D A M N .E A G L E .
GameSack My Aggies are trash this year smh
GameSack Love the coaches reactions after the sack!! AUsome!! WDE!!!!
GameSack Shades of the Sack Game against Alabama in 2005
GameSack Auburns Defense still looks like stick figures at a lot of positions but they have much more discipline this year compared to 2012. i remember the 20032004 defenses looked almost NFL size. This AU team looks like it can win 10 games after a 3 win 2012 season with no conference wins.
GameSack Win the rest of the games ,win the ironbowl and knock Bama out of the championship hunt.. go on to play in the SEC championship is still reachable . yeah .. because this team is young and only going to get better next year This is off a 38 season when many said Auburn would be in the bottom of the SEC this year .. 6 to 7 wins was all that was expected . there is lot that can still be gained this year... If they stay focus and play them one at a time..
GameSack More shades of the 1993 AuburnFlorida game where we sacked Heisman hopeful Wuerffel 3 times.
GameSack welcome back home gus thank you for bringing auburn football back and the winning tradition just 1 yr....... war eagle
GameSack They ARE back!! WAR EAGLE!!
GameSack That game made Ace Atkins a household name for a while. WAR EAGLE
GameSack Great call Rod Bramblett and Stan White. Stan is pumped! Great win against a great team. War Eagle
GameSack looks like Heisman Pundit has yanked Manziel off their top 5 list as of 102113
GameSack Better than 2010? Better than 2827? Better than HeisCam? Not possible.
GameSack Rods call on this is great. Thanks for uploading this!
GameSack I wanna see Dees little dance that got him flagged.
GameSack Id really like to hear Dave Souths call of this
GameSack Carl awesome Lawson! War Eagle!
GameSack Yeah hes not gonna get anywhere near Winston on Monday night.
GameSack Thumbs up for the dance. Thumbs down for your attention whorish need to name it. And a silly ass name at that.
GameSack Itd probably be best if you didnt comment...
GameSack Not very many of us in Knoxville are shedding a tear for Lane Kiffin. He threw us under the bus after getting us in trouble with the NCAA. Congratulations to USC for getting rid of him!
GameSack oh,,it would have been cooler the other way
GameSack No one wants to talk about football in English. The charm of NMA is talking about football in a language where the natives would never talk about football.
GameSack They hired a former Jokeland Raider what did USC expect???
GameSack Fired in the LAX parking lot
GameSack No you cannot put it in english
GameSack actually he was fired in the asu parking lot
GameSack Your able to comfortably earn over 3500 dollars every month just by filling in basic online surveys at home. This website shows exactly how EARN88.COM The secret is how to adjust. I ask myself how am I going to fit into this world, and how am I going to do it without killing myself.
GameSack No videos for three days? I know why. Fuck you guys for working your employees like slaves. That poor girl quit and made your bosses look like an asshole. When will companies realize the best asset is talent. Treat your talent right and they treat you good in return. Shit on your employees and they dont stick around. Fire your managers.
GameSack They should hire Pat Fitzgerald
GameSack FUCk USC.. Love, Die hard Cal fan
GameSack Do you feel accomplished?
GameSack After what kiffin did to Tennessee Im glad hes gone hopefully he wont get to ruin another football program.
GameSack Hes definitely unique in the way he goes about his business. Not surprised he got his marching orders.
GameSack Chris Hughton next, please! Btw, good video :)
GameSack my 1st video on youtube 23092013
GameSack hahahhahahahaha iya da joel
GameSack thx for posting so quickly as always
