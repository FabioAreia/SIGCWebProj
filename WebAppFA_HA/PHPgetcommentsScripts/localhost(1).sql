It wasn''t a prototype as you \nindicated, but rather a concept test to see what the market was before \nramping up production and R&D. It is likely that Samsung was developing \nmultiple versions of the Galaxy gear at the same time. The gear 1 was only \na proof of concept model to generate interest in such a device. The gear 2 \nwill be the culmination of the original design and the feedback from the \ngear 1. This means Samsung wouldn''t have had to redesign from scratch in \nonly 5 months, instead, they would have been designing since the R&D \ndepartment first proposed the gear concept. \n\nMy guess is that the gear 2 has more than a year of design and development \nunder its hood. ï»¿'),

The driving position and outlook  for example  in the 9000 is \nbetter than any other vehicle. Safety excelled in the 9000. The motors are \nbrilliant though my Cosworth 4wd Ford is along the same lines and is rwd. \nThe Americans introduced the rear end wallow as can be seen in the 9-5 in \nthis Clarkson fantasy race. Instead of fixing the few SAAB defects they \nfixed what wasn''t broken but again...that can be repaired also by \nexperienced SAAB small shop specialists. All the same if one watches on, \nUtube, the SAAB used in the appalling police pursuit of a motorcyclist and \npillion passenger both I presume which died and which went for about an \nhour in Sweden.....you are not looking at a mediocre performance. Like \nCosworth, so many SAAB hot-ups are overdone and perhaps ''plain stupid'' and \nto no good purpose but I have never yet seen a SAAB 9000 advertised for \nsale ...as were many hotted Cosworths.......because after increasing \nhorsepower by say 200-400 the owner found himself unable to drive safely \nand particularly in UK it seems....... I own 4 of the 2.3 turbo''s including \nthe Aero, Carlsson and Anniversary only the latter being auto and cannot \nbring myself to sell them. Even stationary they are a very much and \ntimelessly pretty car............  SAAB''s demise was largely brought about \nby resale price free fall and that was due to unscrupulous service agents. \nYou could buy a good house in Australia in a good Northern suburb for well \nless than the price of an Aero ...a safe car overtaxed to blazes to protect \npus-boxes like Holden and Ford. .............One SAAB I looked-at had over \n$7500 for one service!!..I looked for "R and R head" , reco''d engine or \nsome major event...no, all small stuff. Over 15 years my biggest outlay has \nbeen R and R clutch assembly on one car, and a personal decision as I do to \nany car I am driving often, Bilstein suspension. ............The cost of \nreplacing engine mounts is a sharp pin in the hip pocket as two are \nhydraulic. I did that once, recommended by the suspension specialists  and \nfound it wasn''t needed. One of the great cons was to tell people that the \nengine had to come out to do gearbox repairs...around $2000 labour...which \nis a blatant lie....both manual and auto boxed can be removed after \nremoving the LHS wheel and disconnecting the lower suspension \npoint.  ..................Like my BMW''s, driven well they cost little to \nrun and so I can splurge on my suspension improvements which simple are \nBilstein sports shocks maybe springs and certainly tyres and then a truly \nexpert wheel alignment which includes road testing.....I don''t use poly \nbushes...they are a bad idea. ...................The 9000 is a better \ndriver-car than the Carlsson and both are better and more interesting than \nwhat spent decades catching up to what these cars were in the 1990''s. \n..............."Mediocre at best" ...I don''t think so nor did the motoring \ncommentators world wide..., but then what is it being compared-against??  A \ngreat, el supremo, motor  car today has to have one massive asset ''uber \nalles''...400W-1000W /channel stereo....To call something mediocre is easy, \nto know mediocrity quality and real, top quality takes ''wide-ranging driver \nexperience.ï»¿'),
