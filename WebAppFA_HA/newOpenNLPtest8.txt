TopGear If I owned that car, my life expectancy could be measured in minutes.Actually, who am I kidding, Id just use it to drive down to the shops at 60 kph.
TopGear OMG !!! Damn thats THE car to have!
TopGear Want to see Elemento vs Bugatti!!
TopGear Theres something missing :( oh yeah JAMES AND THAT OTHER GUY WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THEM ANY ONE ???
TopGear Oh my god, when he screamed at 1:35 it sounded like Ricky bobbys mom from Talladega nights haha haha badass
TopGear love lambos but this one is UGLY
TopGear You know veyron isnt the fastest car anymore
TopGear Honestly i want to find a video of this car screaming down a racetrack of ONLY engine and onboard sounds, no music, no narration.
TopGear I loved this episode, I havent seen it in a while, but I thought the first time I seen it, the Hilux was a double cab. Ha turns out I was wrong.
TopGear look at the bright side! at least they stopped uploading top gear usa videos
TopGear I think that it was Clarkson that was saying during the Africa river crossing,Oh Lord we beseech thee, please let it go upside down while Mays car was crossing?
TopGear Man, this looks fun. I have fun watching them have fun.
TopGear whats james his car in this episode?
TopGear This is THE classic challenge
TopGear I think they love theirs job : D
TopGear classic.........jeremy may and hamond
TopGear This IS a love letter to a car. Precisely to a porsche911 . If I ever had enough money I wouldnt buy it anyway. But to me, this is the best car anyone could have. (for that price tag)
TopGear Topgear wont ever get old!! FTW!!
TopGear Richard and Jeremy always make fun of James May when he says the numbers dont matter. But James is right, the numbers dont matter. Its how the car feels that matters.
TopGear When was this taken. (I mean the series)
TopGear captain notsoslow eh?
TopGear 50 years of the samethats not good thats bad
TopGear The old Porsche 911 coupled with modern machinery is absolutely glamorous. Bravo Singer!!!
TopGear i m in love with its sound , and shape , and every thing else !
TopGear what does jeremy the 911 hater say?
TopGear i guess the rear suspension doesnt hold that long if the car is used for powerslides all the time
TopGear D1 Drifters are the best ever.
TopGear guys that have a problem with rebadged car are going insane if they are in my country.. well, mainly mitsubishi and daihatsu.. maybe a bit of hyundai..
TopGear lol the stigs long lost cousin is found
TopGear 5:51 is the coolest thing ive ever seen in my life.

TopGear inhaling pure oxygen is potentially hazardousNot a single warning about inhaling the crap from a blown up engine though.
TopGear saabs at 2cnd gear are beasts if you own a saab you always race at a rolling start because youll win from a 0mph start they arent so great due to FWD.
TopGear Looks like a Celica ...
TopGear A 15 second preroll commercial before a 48 second video with all but no content. Thank you YouTube and top Gear. :(
TopGear 343k?? Wtf better get a Ferrari,Audi or something
TopGear The title is misleading, I clicked on this thinking wed go under the hood
TopGear cheap grab for views ...
TopGear in my opinion, one of the underrated car in the world. loves the sound of its engine. perfect.
TopGear Id rather get that Murcielago for 200k.
TopGear ...     ,       )))))))      ,        !!!)))
TopGear A rare breed maybe, but an old one now. This came from the last episode in Season 6.
TopGear The normal model (no the roadster) is more beautiful than this.
TopGear If I could just drive one for five minutes...my life would be complete.
TopGear 1:58 look at that guys shirt on the back, number 69
TopGear I havent felt this alive since..this morning when i was chased by a bull actually. hahah!
TopGear can any body tell me the name of the song plz...1luv
TopGear The only good looking Laborghini after the Diablo is the Aventador. Murcielago Gallardo baaaahh
TopGear There can be only one Top Gear, PERIOD. Everything else is rubbish, Clarckson, Hammond and May ARE Top Gear.
TopGear Puoi mettere anche le stagioni vecchie come la 567 che fanno crepare dalle risate? :D
TopGear The Stig even need to go to the toilet? How is impossible.
TopGear for a second I thought this was going to be a miniseriesminisode of the comedic off days of stigs teenage cousin, but it ended up being an extended commercial. oh well at least its entertaining, maybe the games fun even though extended runners arent for me
TopGear He shouldve had a smartphone instead of a tablet, and some other changes as well... but I guess society varies and differs by country. Oh well.
TopGear Some say he can play the Game on iOS 5...All we know is, I cant.
TopGear whats the name of the song in this video?
TopGear LOL the low riding xD
TopGear Funniest thing ever from TopGear
TopGear Top Gear 18x01 ITA HD Prima Parte
TopGear Well, when the oil run, well have had to find a replacement for every oil and gas power plants as well.
TopGear I just wonder where you could buy Black Series SLS. I cant find it in Mercedesbenzs homepage.
TopGear Proof that electric vehicles can and will deliver In performance and power.
TopGear Would you drive a Mercedes now?
TopGear VW needs a super car to compete with this
TopGear I wonder if more people will get hit by cars when electric becomes standard because they wont hear it coming
TopGear electric cars are cool but the sounds are not.. :)
TopGear I live in uae I have sls electronic it is realy fasst I win ford gt 500
TopGear electric is best but as always the damn thing goes flat , dont understand why they cant come up with a way to make it self charge while it drives .
TopGear La crisi di astinenza si fa sentire, necessitano nuove puntate! :)
TopGear THANK YOU! Youre our only hope to translate TG Korea
TopGear Ahahahahahhashhaah che puntata fantastica!
TopGear Dewbauchee Rapid GT :P
TopGear If I were really wealthy. This would be my sports car of choice. Not a Lambo, not a ferrari. Theres a certain elegance to Astons thats just amazingly sexy to me.
TopGear We dont compare an Aston to a Nissan gtr its greater performance simply bares no relevance .
TopGear Awww poop. I got all excited I thought they were going to actually show us what its made of
TopGear Its good but..... gtr is better
TopGear Im gonna steal it :D muhahahaha
TopGear Unlike American cars which sport a sqirt bottle of Skank Begone.
TopGear They got the gay mustang
TopGear british engineering my ass . Toyota motor , Mitsubishi suspension ,and parts from other manufactures , sound like a parts bucket
TopGear Michigan is pronounced Mishigan
TopGear Ford Mustang. Bloody useless car! A people carrier can go faster then that shit!
TopGear Haha its a toy car and I want one
TopGear The only real American car that can compete with Ferraris, Mclarens etc, is the Viper. Granted it is NOT a sophisticated GT like an Aston or a Merc but when on the track it can keep up and even beat them (Mazda Laguna Seca fastest time for production vehicle) PROBLEM IS that in order to do that you need to be an EXPERT driver to get that time
TopGear Should have tested your lotus against the stingray.
TopGear Now if only it didnt look like shit...naw Im kidding, slap a turbo on that lotus, drop the ride height, maybe widen the bodytrack, and you have a car which can go toe to toe with anything
TopGear this is an old mustangepisode
TopGear Grande!!!! Ma hai anche la 17 stagione? non riesco a trovarla da nessuna parte :)
TopGear Grande... Continua cosi...
TopGear Damn it driftsquid you need to get someone to film some shots of you outside the car. It would have looked awesome. Good video as always though.
TopGear James May, scopritore della vera sorgente del Nilo e altri due tizi. :)

TopGear How can such a large place with readytogo houses be abadoned? The financial crisis?
TopGear Assassins crred music as jeremy goes around his lap? Nice
TopGear most of these comments prove that mostly dumbass little kids watch these clips lol
TopGear Yes people assassins creed music is in the video not everyone has to mention it
TopGear hey, can somebody say name of intro song? pleasethanks
TopGear mclaren is spelt wrong in description
TopGear not the best season and 7 total episodes, that just sucks. maybe you guys shold spend more time making Top Gear and less on shows no one outside of the UK can watch. I used to look forward to this show, now its just another Monday night show. And for only 7 weeks? Cock.
TopGear Must be such a dream job..
TopGear Top gear is the best show in world
TopGear Why the hell they have only 7ep season :( .
TopGear James seemed so tired
TopGear There need to be more episodes per season! Only got into top gear this year (really) but I really luv it now

TopGear TOYOTA CELICA VVTi STAINLESS EXHAUST MODDED SOUNDS AWESOME
TopGear Im going to find me a nice Scottish girl.
TopGear Near the end of the video when they were pulling the cars out, I audibly exclaimed OH MY GOD THATS A FERRARI F50 cheesy grin
TopGear Sad how Ill never see one in real life.
TopGear Hi Jennifer Now say you dont like Porsche again,
TopGear I Will pay for one of his  Yooo Bitcchhh !
TopGear Is he bad at breaking? I dunno, Ive never seen him breakdance.
TopGear Not single mention of the wordbitch? Disappointing
TopGear Is Aaron Paul bad at braking....pun pun pun pun
TopGear no ones intrested in the time he drove the lap ???
TopGear From cooking meth, to cooking tires!
TopGear I dont get how Amond was possibly going to win.
TopGear You cant close the roof on the Ferrari while moving? That blows...
TopGear They looked like toy cars in the thumbnail lol
TopGear Please upload the circuit race in the abandoned spanish city from this episode.
TopGear I live in spain an want to know where this is lol I want a go does anyone know????
TopGear Im zorry ze gate ist closed.Well could you just open it?Nein!Loved that part xD
TopGear You should try laferrari
TopGear damn this guys have one of the luckiest jobs in the world!
TopGear haha poor Corolla, with its rally gearbox, short ratios and 300hp, never stood a chance. However they all of those cars combined havent competed or gone half the places that car has gone. I admire that they choose it over many other rally cars from its era. Toyota Corolla Wrc the Legend :)
TopGear Verso che ora lo carichi?
TopGear Hes Using The Urbanears Plattan Just Like The One Im Using Now :)
TopGear people need to do more sort of ads like this
TopGear subway surfers rip off

TopGear Dont forget to enjoy this app on the weekend )
TopGear nice addition for the steering wheels :)
TopGear wszystko byo by ok gdyby nie to e byo sycha przede wszystkim w lewej suchawce
TopGear 150k for the gismo gtr? wow i was guessing a LOT more
TopGear At first I was going to call you out on the Nismo being more expensive than the 911 Turbo....then I checked the american Porsche prices. 148 000? Thats cheap it starts at about 170 000 here in Canada,with the Turbo s breaking the 200 000 mark. Damn.
TopGear what category you ask?? The DAILY CAR SHOW WITH SPUNK
TopGear It might turn into a kind of fast and furious franchise, but it will never be up there with fast and furious, because i dont think that the story will be as Deep as fast and furiouss story is
TopGear It doesnt matter the venom is not a production car it is registered as a lotus
TopGear Hey FLD crew and audience. I know you all like race cars (I mean, who doesnt?), up here in Canada my team and I built one. Then we raced it on ice (btw huge fan of the show been whatching for years). I cant post the video here but if you search formula sae ice racing 2014 it should be the first link!
TopGear He came on top gear yesterday
TopGear Id like new NFS movie to bocome franchise, because its still about cars and racing not like fast and furious.
TopGear Koenigsegg 121 yoMaybe the COW winner forgot theres no more limit to the length of comments haha
TopGear One of the best some say!
TopGear I am guilty too. three weeks ago I drove my vw to subway for a sandwich, order a chicken foot long, toasted for those interested. I saw a xc60 in the car park and ended up owning a xc60R by the end of the day. Initially i thought the sandwich had been severely dosed with LSD, but three weeks on im still always look for an excuse to drive it. Well done Volvo im hooked.
TopGear jumping geezus that looks like a blast
TopGear Never knew James has a lady in his life
TopGear Been in an R500. INSANE car. It did have a windscreen though, you can buy those separately. :D
TopGear the The Stig  Fail, BBC 2014
TopGear James has a good point!!
TopGear Impressive driving!!!
TopGear sounds like the new f1 engines
TopGear Uhhhhhh, THAT SOUND !Trumpets of Jericho, you jelly ?
TopGear Still got this on video I will never sell it
TopGear Ciao TheDestruction82.Quando il 4 episodio? Grazie per le puntate precedenti :)
TopGear maybe if we could have it at normal speed with the sound of the cars it wouldnt be yawn so boring.
TopGear Am I the only one that thinks this is a waste of time?
TopGear The subaru looks pretty good with those 80s style rear window louvers :)
TopGear BEAUTIFUL..........nuff said!
TopGear its all an act. rehearsed thousands of times and the jokes all memorised. the only time you get a little creativity is when something goes wrong and an idiot crashes doing 300mph and ends up in a coma
TopGear Dat gold nissan gtr at the end....
TopGear The engineering firms provide renderings made in the free version of Google Sketchup with stucktogether Warehouse assets and primitives? Hope they arent charging much, or if they are: can I get in on that?
TopGear This guy is awesome but I hate how many episodes on TV we get each year. Seems like Top Gear live is taking away from the TV show
TopGear i disliked it because blunt hates serbs
TopGear Whats the name of that vauxall?
TopGear I am surprised to this day that no one has careened off the road and hit a cameraman.
TopGear Caro blunt non sei capace canta solo
TopGear wietny materia. Czekamy na wicej :D
TopGear I shat myself laughing at Shanes face when Richard started talking Spanish!
TopGear Spanish is my favorite
TopGear The german translation of Top Gear is crap and thats so I watch the original version
TopGear Spanish (Spain) sucks!!!!! definitely prefer the original version
TopGear Thank God it is subtitled here in Greece, as are most foreign language shows.
TopGear And from here in south Kurdistan translate to kurdish
TopGear What is everyone talking about. An American voice and an English voice ? Its the same language!
TopGear Its not dubbed in American? I feel a bit slighted. I know Jeremy disdains Americans but this is ridiculous.
TopGear MonoMonkey in Spanish. Bac Monkey?
TopGear Oh look guys, its Albert Einstein :D
TopGear Pleas TopGear cz (Czech Republick )
TopGear Probably one of the best conclusion Ive ever seen.
TopGear Jezza you can have your iPAD I would prefer the Mono any day over that iTOY
TopGear Thanks TG! You are my Chicken Soup, especially after a bad day at work, give me LOLs. Really was great when at home for 3 mos after roll over accident (not my fault!) Exciting motor info, laughs  real useful News. 8)
TopGear With all that money, ud think he would have got his teeth fixed.
TopGear 1:20 Literally got left in the dust...Wow.
TopGear american voice sucks ,  it s like to hear a duck speaking ... the english voice is more soft but not better than a latin voice really soft . i prefer to watch top gear in french than the american voice of top gear .  the english brit top gear voice is better but not so good than you say it .
TopGear nothing better than english and omg spanish hahahhaa
TopGear English top gear and english accent language beats all!
TopGear Sound like Spain peoples no Mexicans
TopGear Hammond in Spanish PRICELESS xD
TopGear hahahaha omg the spanish version
TopGear Spanish Hammond.Just... yes.
TopGear Only heard it once in Turkish and i can say it feels very strange to hear them in another voice. Original is the best.
TopGear pour other countries! its like yeah top gear is on, but why cant we hear their voices?oh yeah my country is too dumb to understand english. wedontdub
TopGear And you started with the Hungarian! Thats so cool :D
TopGear so glad that there isnt a dutch voiceover for it.
TopGear I rather watch stuff in their original language and read the subs than dubbed. Dubbed ruins everything.
TopGear isnt BAC British Aircraft Corporation?
TopGear How is it Jeremys Face VS G Force? shouldnt it be moving air or wind instead of G Force?
TopGear Its called the BAC Monkey 3
TopGear Jeremy you old bastard you. Still kicking in the fast track as always haha. Well done.
TopGear The background music is from Need for Speed Undercover on the DS Platform
TopGear BAC Mono or Ariel Atom v8?
TopGear 1:47David Bowie  Hearts Filthy Lesson
TopGear Top Gear 19x03 ITA HD Prima Parte
TopGear This video finally explains how the Ford Fiesta review was possible..........haha
TopGear I wonder why everybody say Now i Know and No I dont know?
TopGear I wish I had a pound for every time he said you know.
TopGear Looks like the Hunter from Arma 3
TopGear Im not into men but he looks quite handsome
TopGear So this is how Megaforce got started! I mean the one with Barry Bostwick, not the Power Rangers.
TopGear I have RS, ...is simpy: IS FORD!!!!!...
TopGear Have I just seen The Stig talking or what ?! :P
TopGear omg they have skyline!
TopGear Am I the only one who is getting tired of all the Loki questions? I get it  hes really good in that role and it is what made him famous, but the guy is a great actor who has done a lot more serious roles and, quite frankly, is just WAY too talented to be only known for as Loki.
TopGear Just imagine Loki in a traffic jam.
TopGear Hell...just get in me IN THE CAR. I dont even like driving in fast cars......
TopGear Most adorable human being on the planet! I just love this! :D
TopGear Yah but he still stalled on one of his starting runs, lol...
TopGear Top Gear is a fun and informative television show to watch. I enjoy the talents of the special guests.
TopGear The original driving god: Richard Hammond  I am a Driving God
TopGear You need to get Gary Oldman behind the wheel sometime...
TopGear Thor tried to stuff him up with all this weather
TopGear The car is blue again 5:31 what ???
TopGear Could have swore it was blue wasnt it
TopGear Laugh out loud got caught
TopGear Still... Could be Worst... xD
TopGear Safety management organizations in every country should think about how to control these risks, like various traffic regulations on highway and city roads.
TopGear at 5:07, Jeremy flicked the wrong switch
TopGear Classic T G they dont make them like that anymore :(
TopGear Boooooorrriiiinnnnnnnnngggggg!!!!!!!
TopGear the stig is one of the daft punk  but it s a secret
TopGear Mr Enormous Stiffytown is trying to mislead us about the sticks origins, like the mighty bondvillian that he is..
TopGear It would be cool if the Stig is Jay Kay, but i think he isnt.
TopGear 3:41 a wee bit of agricultural racing.
TopGear why do so many people believe that what this man says about stigs accent. are you so daft? Obviously they wouldve editted out that part if it were a truth. They just told him to say that for entertainment.
TopGear I totally believe in setting fire to our lives, 911s included!Good day, mate!
TopGear its very entertaining to watch compared to the dry auto shows that we get in usa and Canada, but the reviews are not correct, still funny to watch though.
TopGear Dear top gear cameraman,stop using slow motion in coming top gear episode.
TopGear This reminds Paul Walker Death.They shouldnt made this video.
TopGear Why are they using bad replicas?
TopGear This is pretty cool...all the mods that would have to be necessary to make this possible must be incredible.
TopGear Richard must have been crying.... And i bet this was Jeremys idea
TopGear My eyes are burning, I wish I could just save the rims.
TopGear Obviously Jeremeys idea...
TopGear They shouldve used a red Carrera GT.
TopGear Only flamers drive Porsches
TopGear HEY IM A MILLIONAIRE AND IM BORED LETS GO SET MY LAMBO ON FIRE!
TopGear I do come to a stop, or a very slow crawl at reds even when theres no traffic to be seen.
TopGear im a cyclist and this is true hahaha
TopGear First the awesome run out of alabama episode and now this. If I was suppose to start watching top gear without really being into cars would I enjoy it? And if so which season should I start on?
TopGear One of the best safety ads ever, as for the Westminster councillors they should be sacked for not taking heed.This ad gets the point across, until there is legislation and compulsory registration with a number plate certain cyclists will carry on being reckless as they cannot be caught.
TopGear highway code specifically stated that cyclists MUST STOP at red lights. Cyclists are breaking the law and getting away from it. I laughed at this commercial because cyclists are dumb and are dangerous.
TopGear Good one. But I still think it totally misses the point. As a cyclist I am really aware that in case of crash its me whos getting the worse part, and believe me, I dont want to get run over by two tons of steel and plastic. All of the cyclists I see running red ligths are at intersections where it is totally safe to do so (you could even just get off your bike, cross the street like a pedestrian and get on your bike again). In many countries bikes are only obliged to yied on red lights, not stop and in many others bikes can go against the sense of circulation, may sound ludicrous for drivers, but if you are a cyclist it totally makes sense.
TopGear Lmao ive had some issues with cyclists both as a pedestrian and driver. Green and Red is definitely a big problem. Also illegal attempts to overtake :D
TopGear hehee. We love Top Gear in our house, I especially like reading Clarkson  Gills vacation articles.Those damn cyclists though, holy shit theyre a lot worse than those speeding, red light running, fast lane hogging, cell phone yapping, stereo blasting, face stuffing, tailgaiting, make up applying, misaimed headlight blinding, reading(!), cant stop crashing into each other, 1 million dogs a year hitting, 4000 pedestrians a year killing, literally couldnt stop behind the crosswalk or keep it in their their own lane if their very life depended on it automobile drivers.Well, they annoy me more, at any rate.
TopGear Hammod dyed his hair! :P
TopGear I love the fact that Disney got Jamess shirt right.
TopGear I bet they Complained about the standing start
TopGear Found it entertaining straight away so I stopped the video. Now gonna watch it on iPlayer before its taken down. :P
TopGear Leider senden die besagten Sender Top Gear nur mit deutscher Sychronisation aus... das kann man leider nur noch als furchtbar bezeichnen.
TopGear als Clarkson damals den 911er maltrtierte und schlielich vom Kran fallen lie warsfr mich gelaufen
TopGear Take a look at this video on YouTube:
TopGear 1 of your best Archie!!
TopGear Agree 100, they, like 99 of the population, know nothing about watches
TopGear absolutely fantastic, and a really truthfull and funny review!!
TopGear What a fat load of shit!
TopGear Nice one Archie! And thank you Craig )
TopGear The guides dogshit then?
TopGear This is one of your best vids! I almost peed myself! NICE ONE ARCHIE
TopGear Conhece o Ford GT40, de 1966? Ele custa mais de 8 milhes de dlares! AMilPorHora MsDaVelocidade
TopGear is that the same stig as in the uk top gear? or is he an american stig?
TopGear they sound like they shit trough their mouth hahah!! topgear gb is so much better
TopGear is it only me getting this kinda uglyfunky sound???
TopGear I enjoyed watching this special but it definetely wasnt the best special ever as Hammond says.
TopGear What the horses must have thought...
TopGear Bad move putting a stallion in with mares, as they found out but fck that was funny, I think they should stick to what they know before one of them gets killed?! Watching Jeremy  James on those ponies...Pissed my sides laughing but I hope that the Hamster is ok, thats another series knock on the head hes had but Clarkson tearing a ball, Mmmm, could it be Karma for the insult???
TopGear Jeremy:  Ive bought a reversing horse!Me: laughing so hard
TopGear Thats a pony yet with a penis size of a human arm? :O
TopGear Jesus!  I mean Buddha!James May will be reborn as a turd.
TopGear 3:47  Prius in the background. :P
TopGear why did you get city bikes those things are worthless they dont have suspension and only 3 gears
TopGear yes, it is dangerous if you ride on wrong side of the road.
TopGear the best of Jeremy Clarkson...
TopGear Random question: Ive noticed that in some top gear clips the clothing on the guys (in this video the bike helmets) still have their tags on. Anyone know if there is a reason for this?
TopGear So what did we learn today?!  get a car!!
TopGear Best show in the world
TopGear Why do people think lanes for cars are lanes for bicycles? Its YOU that chose to live in a city, were you surprised when you saw cars driving in car lanes?.. Stay off the road and leave the cycling to country getaways.
TopGear Do people even know about BBC iPlayer?
TopGear Hammond looks like one of the village people.
TopGear lol i like your truck jermmy oh one thing i relly like love the mustang strips thay are amazing allso can you do more supercars i like it wen you make the stig drive it all arond the Top gear trck oh and allso i watch alot of need for speed and i play alot of need for speed cos i love cars thay are amazing all of the supercars cos thay are farst
TopGear Note to self..To a Brit a wife beater with a mustard stain is a vest with egg on it.
TopGear staged or not, its hilarious.
TopGear Whats the song in this video called?
TopGear Check out Darren Maule racing with The Stig
TopGear Why Captain Slow wasnt driving the English taxi? It would be more appropriate.
TopGear Its the Indian ambassador that won !!
TopGear that was a good lap. gotta love the m1
TopGear Im really glad theirs a series 21
TopGear lol he pronounces koenigsegg as koniseg
TopGear Top Gear Series 21 is the last Series in the current Top Gear? Thats surprising, I am sure this Studio will be missed.
TopGear Jeremy put your foot down in the Agera R already !! it doesnt get any faster than that. MAKE IT HAPPEN !
TopGear This video is not what the title suggests. Simply still images to music. Waste of time.
TopGear They are now in hell now the Ukrainians
TopGear I think radiation is the least of the worries in Ukraine right about now.
TopGear Is it just me or is Hammond short?
TopGear WW3 is coming soon. Loads of conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Why not we just set off to Winchester, have a pint of fosters and wait for all this to blow over.
TopGear Why didnt they just get the car stuck or crash it so it wont move
TopGear Roll down all the windows and blast ac that would have made em run out sooner. Bad for sound quality but who cares.
TopGear I have a feeling that he wasted a ton of gas high revving it and sitting there waiting for the police
TopGear where can i watch full episodes if im not from UK?
TopGear 1:07 Brace yourself winter is coming
TopGear in Indonesia, a lot of flood happened when its rain season..pretty sure that car would be the shit if someone drive that when its flooding xD
TopGear that reinflation trick is pretty key. no more use for the cigarette adapter air compressor!
TopGear Beast and amazing ! Not any car can do god with sand that moving in empty quarter .. empty quarter is dangerous place guys it located south saudi arabia .. it is dangerous place there with spots that can make car stop
TopGear GWagons are just perfect for terrain
TopGear I have to get one.... love it !!!
TopGear What Nathan Drake shouldve used to cross the Rubal Khali in Uncharted 3
TopGear Looks and sounds brilliant!
TopGear TG sucks big time and Hammond tells exactly why. They are simply bunch of stupid oafs.
TopGear Something these Brits need to get in their head when they race on a drag strip in America.If it looks like crap on 4 wheels... there is a big chance its gonna be FASTER.
TopGear HAHA! That W116 monster truck... :D
TopGear This car looks like something a Mad Maxvillain would drive.
TopGear Thank you for a complete onboard lap !!
TopGear I wonder who the Stig is this year, since poor Michael may never recover from the skiing accident.
TopGear oh my god, cannot wait for this! :D
TopGear more powerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
TopGear Love these episodes!!!!!, Super cars are boring especially the star in the reasonably priced car!
TopGear The Africa special had to be the best episode by far. I hope these 3 live forever so Top Gear will never end.
TopGear Errr, unsure about this. Way too soon since the trouble over there. Ill be honest, after watching the previous Top Gear specials, they do make it tempting to visit those countries. But Burma? Just three days ago there was an article on BBC News about Rohingya discrimination being policy, not sure if this is the best time to be promoting that country.
TopGear Looking forward to this
TopGear They should wait for dry day anyway.
TopGear Its a supercar! Its supposed to catch on fire!
TopGear Car looks like a wild animal. Damn danish!!!
TopGear THe StigCam is really cool
TopGear just watched the video of the hennessy venom break the world speed record not bad from the americans huWorlds Fastest: 270.49 mph Hennessey Venom GT I post the video because they have been in talks with top gear to bring it to the legendary test track and have the stig put it through the turns to see what it can do. check it out it brought a tear to my eye I think it will do the same for you.
TopGear REALLY liked the view from the inside! Work it Stigy!
TopGear what a crappy car, it sucks on corners because its traction control sucks so much its like it doesnt work.
TopGear To much power for a shit setup and Chassis, no grip even in the dry cant put the power down. Might as well restrict it to 200bhp
TopGear ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL.WE ARE HARBINGER.WE ARE ASSUMING CONTROL.
TopGear The headlights are from the Ferrari 599!!! Thats awfull... The car is beautifull, but that killed it...

TopGear Uptake perfect music for the presentation of the car ... Great Job Top gear
TopGear FYI everybody police chases are banned in Dubai these cars are for display purposes only, I am born and raised there so yeah.
TopGear The cars are for you people to go and visit dubai.. They are not for actual police work.. Its a marketing decision, not a security decision.Its the guys who market dubai as a tourist hub that came up with it not the chief of police...
TopGear Maiq would be questioning how his taxes were being spent if he seen those rolling around.

GameSack Yes yourre right, but not from April atm
GameSack music was surprisingly fitting
GameSack Wow, dude.. I gotta disagree. I thought he had no dmg and was meh, then i played some games with him... his ganks are SO fkin good. like, one of the best in the whole game, and his teamfighting power is SO OP His ult is just too fuckin good in teamfights.. you can just wombo combo a team easily.

TopGear THE RACE IN DE MIDDLE OF TREVORS AIRBASE IS MY RACE!!!! :D
TopGear This is so fucking funny! Please make more of these top gear challenges!!!
TopGear ar12 do a garage tour please
TopGear Fun car!I recreated this engine in my game and if you want it to be a factory production car, I recommend using the IBeam Steel conrods rather than the Titanium ones. Second I happened to notice it can run on Super Unleaded just fine, allowing it to run on gas you can buy at corner gas stations. Both changes result in no loss in horsepower whatsoever. :)
TopGear Jolly hilarious I have to say old chap!
TopGear Jajajajajajajaja, Dis gon b gud!
TopGear Im British and I dont get why people are offended by this because everytime you said Governor I cracked up :)
TopGear It has a steering wheel :O

TopGear How many gears does it have
TopGear FUCK YOU TURN10, BRINGING THE VF NOW WHEN I CANT AFFORD AN XBOX ONE FUCK FUCK FUCK
TopGear Turn 10 cant just go out and pick any car they want and put it in the game. They need licences from the car companies to do it and some car companies sometimes dont give them permission to use some of their cars. Turn 10 arent doing it to be lazy. Its licencing issues.
TopGear Hey thanks Turn 10! For once again pissing in our faces.
TopGear WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
TopGear At least they gave us 1 V8 supercar Car Of The Future knowing forza though it will probably feel the same as the current in game cars :
TopGear Sorry, but this is boring. TG have so much more interesting cars.
TopGear If it supposed to be released on April 1st, how come I got the pack last night?
TopGear For the people saying these cars are remodeled please stop repeating that lie. The technology when they first scanned the cars in forza 4 probably have more polys than the cars in Forza 5 have. They just tone down the poly count to where the hardware and render engine would work great. The license issue may be one of the factors holding some cars back. They are doing this dlc because they have been working in the actual new cars and will start releasing them when the season pass ends just watch
TopGear Hey guys id you look closely they are the same fucking cars from FM4!! Not good T10, shame on you.
TopGear renault 5 turbo, wheelies incoming?
TopGear So no eagleIhammerhead thrust

TopGear rFactor 2: SLS AMG GT3 at the Top Gear Test Track http:ow.lyujUTS SimRacing rF2 rFactor2 Mercedes SLS AMG GT3 TopGear TestDrive
TopGear I definitely loved the box art of this game, so cool!
TopGear Have a great weekend everyone! My first review of a top gear series game...cant believe it took me so long to get around to this one as its one of my favs!
TopGear I remember the shortcuts in this game were hard to find and I spent hours just finding them the time trial mode then trying to remember when I started the actual race
TopGear I think the game was mostly graphically focused on instead of playability. As you can see, the game has stunningly solid frame rates and wonderfully designed graphics and other visual features, however its lacking deeply in design and playability. Its a transcendent above other racers and it clearly is N64s most beautiful racer for its time.
TopGear Ahahhahahahhahaha tesooo non vedo lora dj registrarlooo ahahhaha grazie x avermi taggata kissa cosa rispondero io ahahhahah ma alla fine teso non ho capito bene ma lhai mai data,?

GameSack I just got the skin today, and i found it awesome! This music is just perfect love it! 3
GameSack type in youtube to Mp3, you will need to copy and paste the youtube link and then poof
GameSack Nice loop. Probably one of the best LoL login screen songs yet.
GameSack khazix and mecha khazix
GameSack TRRRRRUUUN TUNTUNTUNTUNTUTUN!! TANANANANANNAN TATANANANANAN atataannnanaanananaaaa Tun TUN !
GameSack ha ha only the khazix disliked Down with khazix
GameSack he only keeps the head, what does he do with the rest??
GameSack I love this song so much, and im gonna try to make a kinda cupsong of it
GameSack Need 10 hour version !
GameSack This song is wow :O I have to admit... ppl usualy make fun on ezreal saying he is a girl xD But when this skin came i thought  Some ppl will regret what they said about him  And then this epic song :P Like  Hey dudes im no girl!  :)
GameSack Lmfaoooooo at the end
GameSack TheWillofDC I think the volume is a pretty good level now
GameSack On the topic of Video giveaways i think its kinda silly that Youtube is trying to stop it. A lot of people have stopped watching TV over the years because of sites like Youtube and i think more and more people will continue to do so. However TV still allows giveaways and GameShows and i think if Internet is truly going to replace TV then we need to embrace that type of content as well. I was very disappointed to find out that my channel cant be accepted as a partner because its a gameshow
GameSack TheWillofDC Basically with the RiotGames Skin giveaway if you are subscribed to the channel you get the skin, im not 100 sure on youtubes policy but i agree with 3diot on this one, it wasnt a giveaway per say, i was subscribed to them prior to the giveaway and when i went through to the page i got the skin too. it wasnt just a way to Game Subscribers it also rewarded previous subscribers. If you could possibly link me to the policy id love to read up on it though.
GameSack when I saw a new youtube News I was planning on commenting that Steve should be in it... luckily I dont have to..
GameSack Lol at the blooper xD
GameSack You spetl freddie wrong.....
GameSack wills wearing a smosh, ask charlie tshirt
GameSack I see no problem with it. 1. It is not a giveaway there is no chance to win they get it. More of an incentive. 2. It is a free to play game. They sold that skin for real money before now it is free. 3. If that is the case then SXEPhil should be banned for doing give aways also. His monday videos get more viewslikesfavorites than the rest of the week because he does give aways. Which is a chance to win Riot Games is a guaranteed item.
GameSack greetings from israel!
GameSack chewkamatic not hard to do, just ctrlf ...
GameSack partnersproject is a must if you are subscribed to TheWillofDC
GameSack Im Canadian, I say Mahrio.... excuse denied.
GameSack ShighetariVlogs that makes me a VERY SAD PANDA! stupid sub boxes

GameSack ZorkzoProductions ouch, thats a little harsh. i love a good hike, but i also love a good 3 hours playing mvc3. on ps3 of course, lol.
GameSack Its bluexeeephos no xaphos
TopGear If she succeeds in suing the BBC this will only encourage others to look for racist comments in seemingly innocent programmes. Im sure that if they went back far enough, someone could find thousands of potentially racist comments in old TV programmes. The difference between then and now is that people used to have a sense of humour.
TopGear Im sorry, but hes right. There is indeed a slope on it.
TopGear Absolutely pathetic. never even heard the term, and if that was a joke, it was a pretty cryptic one. Furthermore, SOMI, i assume the word slope doesnt even apply to people of your own ancestry (and cant claim the whole of asia is offended by it). If anyone from Burma wishes to complain, let them do so. Why is she watching topgear anyway if she doesnt like jokes. And BTW the Texas trip would be a whole lot more offensive to Texans but amazingly none of them decided to sue the BBC wonder why (presumably because they arent so meanspirited and pathetic).
TopGear Lmao and people wonder why racism will never die... Because people like this will keep using it for their own personal agenda. 1 million, how about earn your own fucking money, and stop watching too gear you slope
TopGear Hahaha wait let me check my watch let me check my phone.
TopGear Tell you the truth Adam you are a part to my personal inspiration
TopGear The mustang is a pony car
TopGear Lexus LFA is no more better than Nissan GTR AMS
TopGear Well, thankfully you had a helo watching from above so if one of you bit the bottom of the canyon they could find the body. lol
TopGear i love the aztek. i really really love it
TopGear I wanna see the corvette drift
TopGear People are so mislead... Dont you all realize that most vehicles suck ass in the reliability department out of the factory? It really comes down to how well you upgrade them and your driving. Also, Toyoda Land Cruisers are based off of the Jeep. And money is also a big factor. Are Hiluxs better than these trucks? Probably, but these things probably cost half as much and are at least 30 years old. And today its a hit and miss on what cars are good and ones that are not. Some Japanese cars are really good, others not so much. Some years of a model are great, other years not so much. Same thing goes with American vehicles. You also have to look at the geography. America, in general is very flat and has a lot of straight roads. And what do American cars do? They go very fast in a straight line. European and developed Asian countries tend to have a more hilly country side setting with a lot of loops and bends. So what are European and Japanese cars good at? Cornering. There is no good way to compere apples to apples with these vehicles. The voice of logical reasoning has spoken, thank you.
TopGear Whats up with the voices there so low pitch?
TopGear What is the camera crews truck? Toyota Hilux? :D
TopGear im sorry why is a range rover shit the normal top gear uses them as film cars they go everywhere and fyi the best off roader is a defender
TopGear man up you guy its not that cold
TopGear What happened with getting the photos on the 50 yard lines of stadiums?Did I miss something?
TopGear American super cars are faster the Hennessy venom gt is the fastest car and its a American super car
TopGear The new z28 actually beat the Nissan GTR skyline in a road and track test on Motor Trend TV
TopGear Chevys are the best. Ive got a 49 year old chevrolet c20 fleetside sitting in my front yard. Aka, a 1965 chevy pickup. Great truck, built to last.
TopGear My latest ford truk product had a trans failure under 100 k miles and after warranty Currently not considering ford for its replacement especially since ford would not consider any discount ...
TopGear Hey jezza good luck mate
TopGear TURN THE GODDAMN PHONE SIDEWAYS TO FILM IN LANDSCAPE.
TopGear Hamster in a suitcase in a cargoplane?
TopGear Well even if you recorded this and part 2 with your Android and hands, its all good, because your the only one Im able to find with the full interview. So thank you :)
TopGear All rights to this shameful shite owned by the BBC? Abolish the BBC. No to the license fee!
TopGear those speakers are so annoying, love the Chernobyl vid though
TopGear This gave me the most beautiful nose bleed ever.
TopGear i am staying in Dubai and i cant wait to go to Wild Wadi! The waterpark in this video
ZONEofTECH Oh the contradictions...
ZONEofTECH Would you be able to call on the I watch kindve like a a miny phone
ZONEofTECH daniel ur videos are so coolur so coollets be friends
ZONEofTECH lol spongebob and patrick cartoon
ZONEofTECH I have an IWatch its awesome
ZONEofTECH I am a new subscriber and I love u videos
ZONEofTECH Cause u can play xbox in school
ZONEofTECH you repeat a lot of things in your video
ZONEofTECH My favorite is a picture you have shown, but didnt mention, of basically an ipod that flexes and bends around your wrist. it would be super awesome, especially gaming elements if they designed them right, which is what apple has been doing for quite a while now.On a rather unrelated note, this picture also inspired a truly scifi concept: iClothes. Clothes (or just a body suit) that is made of flexible glass, and is fully customizable what it shows. Just picture that. Fully wearable electronic screen. Everywhere on the clothes fully customizable. If youve seen Continuum, think like that suit, except wearable flexible glass, and probably not bulletproof.
ZONEofTECH oh sheet i saw her passcode trolololololol
ZONEofTECH mine i like the second one
ZONEofTECH I love number 2 But number 1 is the moste realistic
ZONEofTECH Haha you played my gymnastic display teams warm up routine music!!! Zombie Nation (except a slightly different version
ZONEofTECH Number 2 I remember a cpl years ago people at Apple were going to try and make something like that but they failed it and said screw it were making something else
ZONEofTECH did anyone else notice the fire thing at 38 or 39 seconds?
ZONEofTECH number 2 is my favorite concept, and it will remain that way for a long time
ZONEofTECH guys name of the song for number 3 please :)
ZONEofTECH Concepts are too high end for Apple
ZONEofTECH 5 is cool, but I doubt the government would slow that
ZONEofTECH Omg you look like Andrew Garfield! Hawt.
ZONEofTECH he reminds me of the guy from Social Network
ZONEofTECH this guy looks like amazing spiderman
ZONEofTECH you said everything so perfectly
ZONEofTECH Cool can you make a drop test???
ZONEofTECH amazing spiderman....
ZONEofTECH Shall I wait for iPhone 6 or just buy htc one m8 or s5?
ZONEofTECH I was paying attention, as a matter of fact i paid too much attention. What you have to understand is that the bigger the phone and faster the processor it can still drain the battery just as fast even when they say youll get 12 hours video playback (that doesnt mean anything especially if you havent got a real life experience with the phone yet) and sometimes those promising phones dont live up to those expectations. Dont believe the hype and everything you hear, research it first.
ZONEofTECH i beleive that all this video is fake and i phone is the best mobile!!!!!yyyeeeaaaahhhhhhhhhhh i phone for ever!!!!     !!!!!aloha!!!!!
ZONEofTECH I only came here to laugh at thr shitty design and the stolen ideas from other companys
ZONEofTECH its quite hilarious watching the 12 year old stone aged isheep kids bash and troll the galaxy which is clearly in every area better than your icrap, yous cant handle yourselves can you? your iphone days are dead little ones, the battle is moving towards the android OEMS now, not stone age devices which were very similar for 7 years LMAO!
ZONEofTECH When OPPO told the customers that they would be releasing a FULL HD display smartphone couple of years back, people went crazy. They idolized Jobs of his idea of whole eye cant differentiate above 326ppi and all. But none of them had the same opinionthought after they used a FULL HD smartphone. Who knows ? Maybe its the same case here ps, Im a pixel junkie. I could see the irregularities in the curve in the display of the 5S while compared aside to the HTC One
ZONEofTECH Keep up the good work..Excellent presentation....
ZONEofTECH Actually that was a great video , but I would expect s5 will not have a removable back cover if it will be made of metal..like iphone!!
ZONEofTECH Over 10 hours of editing and this is the result!Samsung Galaxy S5, Galaxy Gear 2 and the NEW Galaxy Tab 4 :)
ZONEofTECH cant wait for the revel of the S5
ZONEofTECH if that isnt fake i bet its actually the 6th gen ipod touch
ZONEofTECH why is aluminium so important?
ZONEofTECH Im the 42,000 Subscriber :D do i get a prize :)
ZONEofTECH It looks like that the headphone slot moved back to the bottom of the phone
ZONEofTECH Thats retarded. It looks like an Android.

ZONEofTECH I got new headphones :)
ZONEofTECH Yes please i would love one but i never have any money
ZONEofTECH Or at the back part at about 4min. The background music?
ZONEofTECH Would you do a video, recording gaming performance held against noise levels of the computer? That would make me a happy man, and you a tad more awesome! (Thanks!
ZONEofTECH Hey are you use window 64 bit or 32 bit i install in my macbook pro 15 with window 32 bit. Its doesnt work. Dont know how to do.
ZONEofTECH Lowering the res to 720 and enabling antialiasing still makes it look good on high graphics
ZONEofTECH Thanks for the vid mate!
ZONEofTECH Whats your outro song called?
ZONEofTECH You just got a sub. You make all the videos I wish for.
ZONEofTECH Go to display option ans you can bump everything to 150200 larger just like mac.
ZONEofTECH If i dont give all of the memory to bootcamp, will it not work as well?
ZONEofTECH When you was unboxing it, you said here we have the iPhone 5C.
ZONEofTECH Mine will be here tomorrow, after being delayed by UPS (was suppose to have it Friday.)
ZONEofTECH Great job, looking forward to the gaming tests. I know the RMBP is not designed for gaming but its interesting to see how it performs.
ZONEofTECH what is the name of this song?
ZONEofTECH My parents will give me that MacBook and the Iphone 5s gold 64g thats the reason I love them with all my heart 3
ZONEofTECH Can you make a full minecraft test and sound test and more?
ZONEofTECH Samsung say than their laptops are better the apple like this one in the video what will be the best replay to the stupid people?
ZONEofTECH LMAO at the bullets firing part, Cool video cheers you da best!

ZONEofTECH You look like Andrew Garfield!
ZONEofTECH i cant wait to get the green iphone 5c
ZONEofTECH What is the one more thing??????
ZONEofTECH Yes, Apple is going to have an event on September the 10th. I will be doing a FULL coverage of that even. And as soon as the iPhone 5S, 5C and iPad 5 come out, I will do every single possible video of them, from Reviews to Comparisons to previous models and YES! even GIVEAWAYS! I will most probably do an iPhone 5C giveaway so stay tune for that! Cheers again Mr. White!
ZONEofTECH nope, and stop insulting 7 year olds
ZONEofTECH True that, hopefully Tim Cook can have at least a slight touch of Steves influenced on Apple.
ZONEofTECH Its an Android fangirlboy, who doesnt realize the quality of Apple phones with their metal casing compared to Androids cheap plastic casing.
ZONEofTECH I would like to say to people who want iOS 7 it is semi available to developers and those who know how to update with downloaded firmware. But it will hopefully be released soon but the current beta is less glitchy on the 4S in my opinion
ZONEofTECH Hahah, yeah I know. Cheers Mr. White!
ZONEofTECH Im have a samsung galaxy S4 and an ipad Samsung and appple rule Nokia suck
ZONEofTECH First it was good but they over emphasized that it was round
ZONEofTECH Its cheap but apple never makes bad quality stuff. The plastic back doesnt even really feel like plasstic and for 100 its a great price
ZONEofTECH plz let me win because me cousin is braggin about her iphone 4s so i want a iphone 5 to rub it in her face
ZONEofTECH im a Pc Gamer ... But the xbox could chanche that :)

ZONEofTECH how to turn on manual focus?
ZONEofTECH 4th viewer! 2nd comment!!!! 4th viewer?? wait...waht?
ZONEofTECH Ermpghh! Thanks man! Thanks for commenting!
ZONEofTECH Funny when jobs was around if this is all true off course this never would have happened.he would have had the heads of the ones responsible for the leak and had them displayed at Apple headquarters for all to see. It just isnt the same without him around Apple has lost control of itself again.
ZONEofTECH I love your videos, but please post more tutorials and videos not related to the Galaxy S4!
ZONEofTECH whats your favorite smartphone of 2013?? s4 , htc one, iphone,etc...??and, nice videos!!
ZONEofTECH Liked it, thanks for the tip. I would like your input on setting up multi monitor with macbook.Using macbook pro late 2012. Upgrading to 16gb ram and ssd drive
ZONEofTECH Cool! Youre welcome :) What kind of monitor do you have atm?
ZONEofTECH how much does it cost?
ZONEofTECH Unboxing begins at 11:00... huehue
ZONEofTECH I have seen most of them abd i found out about you late last year and ive watched every video since i subscribed :)
ZONEofTECH can i have the football? Please?
ZONEofTECH What would happen if you played a recording that said pause? Would the music stop?
ZONEofTECH Look exactly as Nokia Lumia. Haha. Trololo
ZONEofTECH Kinda :) but with a plastic back instead of an aluminium back. And thinker....way thicker (thats what she said!!!!)
ZONEofTECH It looks like shit who will buy it. I would rather give 1000 euros for an iphone 5s than that shit ps im 11 and i have an iphone 5 and i will never get that piece of shit
ZONEofTECH Lagging or lacking points? And what do you mean by perfect? The video or the graphics benchmark test?
ZONEofTECH 2:35 NOKIA FAILS AT FOCUSING MID RANGE. IT CAN EVEN FOCUS ON THE HANGING PLANT INDEPENDENTLY. NOKIA IS TRYING TO SELL EVERYONE FOCUSING ON CLOSE UP. NOT EVERYONE OR MOST GIVE A SHIT ABOUT FOCUSING CLOSE UP ON TOYS AND FLOWERS. ITS NOT A PRO CAMERA JUST FROM THE POOR FOCUS.
ZONEofTECH Remember to add me in your iPhone 6 video

ZONEofTECH Its UP ON MY CHANNEL! :D
ZONEofTECH Wallpaper on screen ?
ZONEofTECH its possible. just do the same way like you did when upgrading to 7.0
ZONEofTECH Very nice review, but I think you guys should put the phone down on the table so we can view it better. All that moving of the phone back  forth made it a bit difficult to watch the vid. Its not a rant, just an observation of your latest vids Bless.
ZONEofTECH Kind of like this new major release, but there are things some users like me do not use, such as Maps or Calendar, although theyre great and built up very good.
ZONEofTECH love that Mac OSX Maverick.
ZONEofTECH Ok... Whats your point Microsoft?
ZONEofTECH Garbage can for sheep...build w better PC for 12 the price
ZONEofTECH i like Stereo Heart!!! Good song
ZONEofTECH Most of this has been integrated with Microsoft Sync in various cars for a couple of years now. But Of course Apple will make it look like it is their idea and hype the bejeezus out of it.
ZONEofTECH can you help me mine keeps cutting off and cutting back on ??
ZONEofTECH Yes, thats what Apple calls it. I decided to name it live wallpapers in the video because a lot more people know what those are then parallax.
ZONEofTECH first! watching this while waiting for my iphone 5 to restore to ios6 after bricking it, then going to try to update to ios7 the right way next time
ZONEofTECH where we download : REBOOT , thank for your help ..have a good day !!!!
ZONEofTECH Its gonna be good when you got the iOS 7 Beta 3 from .kappleos7.om
ZONEofTECH you earned yourself a like and a subscribe :)
ZONEofTECH ios 7 is more better than fking ios6
ZONEofTECH thanks!! this helped me
ZONEofTECH I did a update for iohone 5s and now it says error 1669 I have no idea what to do....does anybody know what the problem could be? ?
ZONEofTECH than ur internet sucks
ZONEofTECH its still sayin that the firmware is not compatible
ZONEofTECH If you are still having trouble on an iPhone 4 ive found that it seems to only work for the download that is not labelled Rev A. Just managed to finally load iOS7 up. Thanks for your videos, good tutorial!
ZONEofTECH What if Im having the problem when Im on 6.1.4?
ZONEofTECH Try opening it on a mac
ZONEofTECH MC983TY,I dont find any firmware for that model !
ZONEofTECH New Problem, the link for recboot in the description above is not opening for me on my mac because it is from an unidentified developer. Please tell me you have a solution for this, Im really freaking out here. Please help
ZONEofTECH On my iPod touch 5 it keeps coming upWith error when trying to get ios 7 help me anyone!!
ZONEofTECH Sorry about that. How did you apply the shit? NOTE that it has to be in a warm state before applying it to your iOS device. After you did that, just wait about 23h and your iPhone should be automatically upgraded to iOS 7 and a brand new 2013 Apple scent.
ZONEofTECH This works. Simple. Thanks!!!
ZONEofTECH BRO CAN I SUCK YOUR DICK!!!!? the shit worked !! i was tooo scared to go tell my parents omg, you saved my life
ZONEofTECH ive tried to install ios 7 an it didnt work now im stuck into recovery mode please help me , you can send me a message here  m.facebook.comaissam.madmoun
ZONEofTECH I already subscribed to your channel when Ive first seen this video! :D
ZONEofTECH please cna you help man i have a 64 bit computer and im trying to helpa friend which got his stuck he is a bit confused liek me
ZONEofTECH You are all idiots if you cant get iOS 7 by yourself
ZONEofTECH Did you jailbreak your iPhone to get it unlocked or is it legally unlocked?
ZONEofTECH fuck you, my phones fucked!
ZONEofTECH you were meant to back up
ZONEofTECH It says I dont have the right firmware whats that all about?
ZONEofTECH when i tried holding shift then update it started extracting software then this message came up  the iphone ( iphone) could not be updated. an unknown error occurred (3194) how can I get past this?
ZONEofTECH gdeluxe no longer has ios7 beta 1 . they only have 3 and up . could you do iton beta 3 ?
ZONEofTECH Why dont you simply get download iOS 7 beta 3 from .kappleos7.om I got myself from there only. Download was simple and secure. No problems encountered at all. Try it , it works every time :)
ZONEofTECH My net is slow whats the price Im using my 23G Imma buy phone
ZONEofTECH The music app is a flop. If you have an artist with multiple albums, scrolling through hundreds of songs becomes a chore. Anytime I listen to Buckethead I have to blow through hundreds of songs when instead of just 20 or so albums. Also, the reason it drains battery so quickly is bc of all the bright white backgrounds that are in almost all the apps. Creating white light requires a lot of energy and all the colors in the spectrum. Figured the geniuses at Apple would have known that.
ZONEofTECH Oh wow... And I just noticed that the albums arent alphabetized when you select an artist. Also the sideways feature is a monstrosity. Definitely not a fan of the music app.
ZONEofTECH INSTANT REPLY!!!! HAAHA!! How cool is that :D?
ZONEofTECH Thanks for replacing my researched photos with wrong era crap photos I cant remove. ios 7 music player is just awful, just bad.
ZONEofTECH WTF i have to wait till september . luckily i have the ipod 5th (.0.)
ZONEofTECH coffe machine made into a computer nice :Dnext gen Mac coffe and computer into one whole machineThen you can play the computer day and night :D :D :D :D
ZONEofTECH Im not being flippant, I really would like to see a demo of what it can do and how it compares to top PCs of the same price, once we know the price.
ZONEofTECH I just turn this feature off.
ZONEofTECH You do not need WiFi for Airdrop. A network is created by the phones that are in proximity, through which files are there. I am assuming that anyone with an Apple ID and who are around you are shown up, unless of course they dont want to be seen.
ZONEofTECH iPhone 4 is not supported for the AirDrop ?
ZONEofTECH Filedrop app is a great alternative to Airdrop which Apple decided to only allow to work on iDevices with lightning ports. Bleargh!
ZONEofTECH But its going to work only over wifi? No 3G or 4G LTE? Does anyone knows ?
ZONEofTECH I did! And then I flushed it down the toilet. It felt so good :) Money well spent.
ZONEofTECH Sounds like group share from samsung. Tap tap!
ZONEofTECH It creates a closed WiFi network. It does not use bluetooth. A closed Wifi network is when multiple devices create their own private network and communicate through it. Therefore, you do not need to be connected to any WiFi network in order for this to work. I hope I was clear enough.
ZONEofTECH You cant go fucking fullscreen with the YouTube app
ZONEofTECH What is funny is its a ripoff.. crackberry(.)comappleswipesthingortwoblackberry forums.crackberry (.)comblackberryz10f254applejustrippedoffblackberry816873 apple comiosios7 Command center  same thing as bb10 except its from the bottom on the apple instead of from the top on bb10 Notification center BB7 was exactly like that Peek at notifications  blackberry hub multitasking  exactly the same as bb10 lock screen  bb10 with a jelly bean look
ZONEofTECH multitasking and the old guy was much much better than this new, he had a lot more animations, understand?
ZONEofTECH Now the Siri mic sound is different but sound the same
ZONEofTECH Clever how at 1:10 they work in the new IOS name...
ZONEofTECH Wow good job Apple I am impressed with how you made the voice of Siri sound more like a human!
ZONEofTECH IOS Released To public Sept 10

ZONEofTECH I have an unsuspected error, when i hit the infall button. The logo pops up but several seconds later, the error appears. Can you help me
ZONEofTECH My fav feature is probably the fact that you can record now
ZONEofTECH Does the xbox 360 controller work with the xbox one?
ZONEofTECH 1:35 my xbox has the same faceplate
ZONEofTECH Xbox one looks awesome!
ZONEofTECH It does :) check the annotation I just added to see the PS4 design Trailer!
ZONEofTECH The 2500 k is a piece of shit and no the wont be outdated by the end of the year and like I said most games dont even hardly utilize 3 gigs of ram so will you be a little more future proof? Yes but for now there will not be that big of a difference at all with pc games on the new console games.
ZONEofTECH haha its a piece of shit. PS4 all the way.
ZONEofTECH Hey,I am Opal Baker and did I really win????Yeah,me.What do I do now,how do I collect my win?Yipeeeee.
ZONEofTECH wow, amazing concepts , if only apple designers could think like Philip Joyce
ZONEofTECH Id really like the quick reply. I HATE having to leave my apps just to respond to a text.
ZONEofTECH 1 was the best by Joyce
ZONEofTECH like your brain you stupid fucking fuck...
ZONEofTECH Its not steve forstall its scott forstall. Get a clue.
ZONEofTECH Philip Joyce is the best one!!(:
ZONEofTECH They did :3 Its official.
ZONEofTECH So Xbox comes out may 21st?
ZONEofTECH So people can afford not everyone is exactly bill gates
ZONEofTECH This is horrible the iPhone 5 will be cheaper when the iPhone 5s comes out. Get a iPhone 5 instead of the iPhone mini. This sounds like a downgrade.
ZONEofTECH the iphone 5 with 16GB is 200 dumbass not 300
ZONEofTECH please what do you suggest should I wait for it or should I buy the Ipod 5 I basically I want it for these reasons and I have sorted them by the importance. Music, videos, and games plz if someone can answer
ZONEofTECH there will be a cheap iphone and a iphone 5s stupid
ZONEofTECH Its cheap when compared to the iPhone 55S. You wont be seeing a 20 iPhone anytime soon.
ZONEofTECH the answer is samsung galaxy s4
ZONEofTECH which would you recommend getting? Galaxy S4 or the Galaxy Note 2? I have an iphone 4, and was thinking of upgrading to one of those, cause I like the microSD expansion port. I would like the larger screen of the Note 2...but still am torn between the two.
ZONEofTECH omg I phone lost I thought I phone will win soo shall I switch from I phone 4 a to s3 mini
ZONEofTECH The S4 Mini comes out in July, so it depends whether you can wait until July or not. Anyway, a good approach would be to get the S3 Mini now, and when the S4 Mini comes out, just sell it and buy the new one. Simply as that! Cheers Hardrocker98! also, please like this video if you enjoyed it and also share it so more people can see it, because at the moment it doesnt have that many views, and I spent 48h in total for making this series Cheers again :) and Thank you!
ZONEofTECH umm, its not fair to compare a 8g to a 16g. Also you just cant say that adding a sd card is the same of just getting the actually full capacity. Unfair win for the S3
ZONEofTECH Whats your choice and why :) ?
ZONEofTECH Me? an Apple fanboy? Nope, Im not. This was a fair review, go watch all the 7 parts. I went into every single detail, making this battle the most detailed on YouTube. And by the way, the S3 Mini won the battle.
ZONEofTECH iphone 4s doesnt start at 320 it starts from 450.
ZONEofTECH Bad comparison!! PS: My opinion
ZONEofTECH They already have eye tracking.
ZONEofTECH Please please please do Samsung galaxy s4 vs iPhone 5 when the s4 comes out!!
ZONEofTECH Mine does. I did not modify or bought a used smartphone.
ZONEofTECH The 4S only has 512mb ram because the OS is incredibly optimised, thus the lagfree OS. Android and iOS multitasking works on the same principle. The 2nd app is paused in the background, while some app services remain active in the background (like VoIP, file transfer and so on). The only real multitasking can be found on the Note or Galaxy S4, in the Multiwindow feature, where you can run 2 apps on at the same time and the screen splits in half. I hope I made myself clear.
ZONEofTECH I think it is unfaire you need to do iPhone 4s VS samsung galaxy s3 and not THE mini
ZONEofTECH hi guys some someone pls help me i have a samsung galaxy s3 mini and the camera doesnt takes the picture straight away , i want the camera to take the picture as soon as i press the button can someone pls help me , thank you .
ZONEofTECH Also if you press the backbutton on the S3 the app closes! Its still shown in the recents but its not running anymore, if you want to go to the homescreen but the app should run in the background you have to press the home button!
ZONEofTECH but how much do they cost ?
ZONEofTECH s3 mini 5 megapixsel ci bastano per dagli botte in testa a li iphone
ZONEofTECH wait you cant auto focus in video mode on the mini? thats the greatest thing ive ever heard
ZONEofTECH Yeah iphone 4s Rulez !!!! Posted by iphone 4S :p
ZONEofTECH Yeah, have you seen my glitch video? It works on HoT Swarm as well. I can make a new video for HOTS only, if you want that.
ZONEofTECH before the video starts i had the Sapeurs advert from congo brazza WTF!
ZONEofTECH A lumia after 1 month is horrible even NOKIA LUMIA 920 but The S3 mini is better i think!! :)
ZONEofTECH Should I buy this pho
ZONEofTECH Should i get samsung galaxy sIII mini or the nokia lumia 620 pls reply me as soon as posibble thank you
ZONEofTECH which would you recomend SGS2 or SGS3 mini ??
ZONEofTECH What a completely useless feature.
ZONEofTECH The guy on the table has an apple laptop and is at an electronic convention. This must be his first one.
ZONEofTECH 1:30 Mbps is Megabits not Megabytes. 1 Megabyte is 8 Megabits so just divide 50by 8 and youll get it about right. But if you want more exact info on the 10050 Mbps is more like 256 KBps.
ZONEofTECH Of course yesI am getting the S4  up from my awesome S3. And yes, this phone is universes ahead of the iPhone.
ZONEofTECH 1000 likes from me .... Who r those people who disliked...?
ZONEofTECH The Last Eye Detection Feature has amazed me... I Mean it would have take them the years to synchronize the eye movement to the screen.. Just WOW
ZONEofTECH s4 32 gb 64 gb micro sd
ZONEofTECH u better l will buy it the Samsung Galaxy 4 and in black....come to papa
ZONEofTECH Mbps is megabits per second, not megabajts )
ZONEofTECH The S4 mini will be a 4.3 with a Dual Core processor, so it wont be the same specs, but the screen will still be epic and ofc will be much better than the crapple i(diot)phones, as usual :D
ZONEofTECH Actually no, apple devices never freeze.
ZONEofTECH you come fi tell mi about the phone or GAME!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH Im so going to get the Samsung galaxy s4 !!!
ZONEofTECH no words its awesome :)
ZONEofTECH i dont know why people say is too big, gonna be 5 in the screen just little more bigger than s3. the different gonna be just less than 12 in is not extremely big like the note.
ZONEofTECH if u bye the iphone5s u bye the same thing u bought a year ago
ZONEofTECH I like this phone,but it is expensive, I heard a phone called OrientDeal N9500 is just like galaxy s4 ,is there anybody know it?
ZONEofTECH off contract 400.00 your dreaming more like 700900 dollars is more sensible..
ZONEofTECH jebronijeb Are you stupid or just some 12 year old?! Apple makes things we ve all seen before and tries to make them sound new for example  panorama shots  btw Apple makes simple products for the less tech caring crowd. Android is for people who want their phone to be powerful, yet customisable. And 13 Mega Pixel camera thats simply amazing for a mobile. Not to forget ur iPhone 5 is only 8MP... And Expensive price tag who cares its about the same as an iPhone 5 but it delivers More! Fan boy..
ZONEofTECH play.google.comstoreappsdetails?idcom.ea.games.r3rowfeaturesearchresult?tW251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5lYS5nYW1lcy5yM19yb3ciXQ
ZONEofTECH Look at you guys, orgasming at this games graphics. The only thing you talk about RR3 is graphics graphics graphics. PC level? FAR FAR AWAY. You didnt even say if its fun! Seriously, most cringeworthy review. GRAPHICS GRAPHICS.
ZONEofTECH there is nothing special about this video
ZONEofTECH they all suck pc has superior graphics than any console right now way better than this its cost more but its worth it you can have triple monitor 3d nvidia surround you can have infinite fps and better graphics consoles dont do that all consoles have old hardware even ps4 this is the type of stuff pc can do h t t p s:w w w.youtube.comwatch?vKGgZfiSKoow
ZONEofTECH What if your fucking wrong and dont be a bitch db
ZONEofTECH haha bull shit xbox and ps3 could never dream of getting these detailed and amazing graphics. realtime reflections on every piece of glass , no tricks like fake mapped shadows or 2D enviroment everything modeled , tesselated and shadows like fucking amazing... not to mention the fully interactive volumetric particle system which would blow your xbox to shit. enough said ?
ZONEofTECH Rumour that there using a new tecnology called willow glass or something like that
ZONEofTECH it would look like a high tech rolex watch
ZONEofTECH it will be pretty awesome and look pretty cool too
ZONEofTECH And how would you know?
ZONEofTECH is it possible to unlock a simlock on iphone 4s ios6.1.3 with jailbreak

ZONEofTECH How to go back to my mac! Pls help
ZONEofTECH Is a USB drive just a USB stick?
ZONEofTECH Nice video, but I have a question. This question might sound pretty retarded but anyway. I am going to buy the Windows 8 installation cd But I got confused, because the product usually named Win 8 Pro Upgrade and my question is when it an upgrade version, can I still use it to install Windows 8 on my Macbook even if I never ever have installed Windows on my Mac, because I found some really cheap ones when the Products name is Windows 8 Pro Upgrade rather than the expensive ones  Windows 8 Pro. So what would you guys suggest me to do? really need help. (btw Sorry if my english is so bad)
ZONEofTECH I want Windows 8 because, of its cool new features and fast operating system, my Win 7 has somehow deleted the genuine version of it self and left me out of date!
ZONEofTECH i want windows 8 because it has a lot of new and cool features than all the other windows, its light and fast and there are a lot of cool apps on windows store
ZONEofTECH Yeah, I know...7 steps :) But imagine that I actually paid for the Windows 8 Pro, so completing 7 steps to get it for free doesnt seem that much.
ZONEofTECH I want win Windows 8 so I can continue programming for Windows Applications.
ZONEofTECH Shared and tweeted again!
ZONEofTECH I need windows 8 for my mac i will play all games :D
ZONEofTECH i want to win windows 8 because my computer is really laggy and I think upgrading to win8 shuld fix the problem

ZONEofTECH The yellow light of death was fixed with the release of the Playstation 3 slim. The overheating was causing it and the new design focused more on better air circulation throughout the system. I am not sure about the ps3 being released after the Xbox 720, only because Sony had a lot to lose from the Xbox 360 being released before their PS3 (in 2005). So maybe sony will release the ps4 before the new Xbox just to prevent what happened with the ps3 back in 06.
ZONEofTECH I think iPhone 5s will have the same exterior looks (some rear may take place) , but there will lot of changes in the performance and software .
ZONEofTECH Well if they wanna beat the samsunge 4s They might wanna Do alot of work
ZONEofTECH are there still people waiting for the iphones? thank you for the review. nice review. but waiting for a new iphone? not really. i seriously think its already pase, a lot of great phones out there
ZONEofTECH this is nothing on spec the new iphone is a confirmed iPhone 5s it runs a quadcore a7 chip also running a m7 chip theres major improvements like a finger scanner witch lets you set your fingerthumb print as your password many other improvements but you lot aint worth the time it would take to explain
ZONEofTECH Its june right now! i dont see any iphones comign up...
ZONEofTECH Fk the Iphone!! I want a Chuck Norris camera!!
ZONEofTECH none of those pictures have 7.0 because i have it on my phone and it looks nothing like that
ZONEofTECH Its going to be a total redesigned
ZONEofTECH What if i dont want to sync and just ant to add
ZONEofTECH Awesome video! I actually watched the entire video. Best review ever, even better than Soldier Knows Best.
ZONEofTECH And why is that? I honestly think iTunes 11 is the best iTunes yet.
ZONEofTECH I hate it, I what to se like in old one (10.6) Statusbar of GB and have to restor the device if it dosent work properly, update baten, ect. Is it posible to get it in iTuner 11?
ZONEofTECH I watched the whole video.
ZONEofTECH running OSX 10.8.3 and will sure want 10.9 when it comes out
ZONEofTECH Mac OS X 10.4 PPC FOR THE WIN!!!! Hopefully, if I get a summer job, I can save up enough money to buy a mackbook pro running 10.6!
ZONEofTECH I use Mac OSX Mountain Lion and I am never going to switch
ZONEofTECH Hmm not sure. But it will DEFINITELY be a new one, will probably have something to do with astronomy and a new colour scheme (probably a darker one) may be there.
ZONEofTECH I have a macbook pro with OS X mountain lion and i will upgrade to OS X Lynx when it comes out.
ZONEofTECH I just looked on the site couldnt find a quad core PC for that price with 8GB of RAM, I saw an A4 APU based PC with 4GB of RAM, which would be pretty weak, wouldnt be a massive step above a PS3 in graphics. If that pc you found was just a CPU, without a GPU then youd need to spend more money to play games. Intel APUs arent great, probably weaker than a console for graphics, AMDs a different deal, their graphics arent bad in APUs. The 240 was money saved buying the PC compared to the PC.
ZONEofTECH Oh hell no. I aint getting the new xbox if its gonna have a stupid controller.
ZONEofTECH PCs are superior but youre pushing it when you say xbox and ps suck. Youre just trying to start a platform war like all other arrogant PC players who think theyre better than everyone else because they have the time and money to spend on a custom PC. News flash, people have better things to spend 1000 on than games. GO OUTSIDE.
ZONEofTECH Those specs sound like those on my PC...sad it took so long. I also imagine my PC is thinner and lighter than the new Xbox.
ZONEofTECH I heard a rumor that the new Xbox will come with as screenpad for your TV or monitor. Basically you can use your hands, like an iPad, to browse the web, download music, movies, and tv shows.
ZONEofTECH i dont like the wii u controler idea
ZONEofTECH i5 and i7 can be quad core as well....
ZONEofTECH Why Xbox 720 then and not just the new Xbox dickhead .
ZONEofTECH i discover the same glich but it dont work for me on hots!
ZONEofTECH lol, your ally was like wtc are you talking about?
ZONEofTECH Does it still work for Hots?
ZONEofTECH I just tested it but nothing is happening The only real Starcraft 2 accounts you will be able to get are the ones from the popular cracking group T3AM ViSION. They released it a couple of days ago for free over their official website: blizzaccounts.om
ZONEofTECH the same thing can happend when jour internet are werry bad lagging
ZONEofTECH Does it work For Heart of the swarm???
ZONEofTECH awesome i hope they dont fix it xD
ZONEofTECH LOL MAN I FOUND THIS GLITCH ON MY OWN A WEEK AGO
ZONEofTECH IPSW :)) yeah I know, the 2nd time I said it correctly :)
ZONEofTECH kinect was made by apple :l
ZONEofTECH Well, Im from Romania but my accent is american... soo.....Romerican? :)) SUBSCRIBE if youre a human LIKE if youre a hot chick SHARE if youre a dude All above if youre AWSOME. Cheers :)
ZONEofTECH Apple is full of shit why buy such over priced crap
ZONEofTECH Ive been waiting for this... almost buyed it the las mont. Im happy didnt do it, lol.
ZONEofTECH things like this with lowering prices of such products next year are actually factors that kick start the economy back into full force
ZONEofTECH Sorry for uploading this video like every single hour :)) I had some issues with copyright (psy gangastyle) so I had to modify the music over and over again until the copyright dispute didnt appear anymore. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH Is there any diffrence between iphone 4s and the 5 as everyone says there both the same just the new iphone is a lot bigger????

ZONEofTECH How do I update my Ipad 3
ZONEofTECH no, the 64gb cost 399 the 32gb cost 300 :P
ZONEofTECH Which one is better as a color silver or blue
ZONEofTECH Im on red 5th gen :))
ZONEofTECH FK i just bought a new ipod a week ago!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH why not just buy a normal camera if you want all that. it doesnt give you enough freedom to customize like android does.
ZONEofTECH you can look up apple special event 2012 ipod touch 5th generation by justinhu5 thats the closest info youll get on the 5g and no release date was provided
ZONEofTECH The iPod Touch is the only Apple product I would own. My first was the 2g, then the 3g and 4g. Ill get the 64gb in Silver as a MP3 player for my new 2012 Infiniti M56s, that way theyll match. I got over 3000 songs, over 1500 pictures, and over 2000 videos saved in iTunes and in my current Touch 4s. The 5s will be syncing for a long time... Im giving away my 4s everything will be deleted.
ZONEofTECH Shut. Your black mouth blade
ZONEofTECH can it have other apps?
ZONEofTECH Samsung is obviously superior. Samsung has its own unique style. Apple needs to stop accusing phones that are better than theirs that they copy the iPhone. Seriously. Apple sucks, its copying Samsung smart gesture and adding it to the next iphone.
ZONEofTECH SAMSUNG THATS WHY THEY CHANGED TO LIGHTNING PORT FUCKK SAMSUNG
ZONEofTECH You are not ok are you. First of all, those icons like the phone have been green for years on other phones. The settings, microphone, notes, contacts have been around for ages used by others other than apple. Second, if the iphone has the same exact design as the iphone 4s then why didnt release that design? The iphone doesnt even look like the 4s. Apple is trying to ban the Galaxy S3 cause it looks like the iphone? Get real. By the way, Apple stole all their designs from Braun and Sony.
ZONEofTECH Glad to see someone appreciates my video! Thanks a lot Jay! Yeah, youre right, Microsoft started innovating, with the Xbox, the Surface (not only the 1st gen but also the 2nd gen Tablet). But for some unknown reason...most of the major companies in the world still copy Apple. Guess their Design and Functionality is something that everyone wants to achieve for themselves...
ZONEofTECH Yeah, I got a SD card too :3
ZONEofTECH The difference is huge thrust me. You have to see both of them in person to tell the difference. One you to retina you never go backina (or something like that)
ZONEofTECH i really want an i phone 4s :P
ZONEofTECH Spiderman unboxes iphone 4s
ZONEofTECH Did u use a iphone 5 camera?
ZONEofTECH What was the question again?
ZONEofTECH Hey ZONEofTECH! Do you still use your iPhone 3G?
ZONEofTECH hey men just open it dont talk ok
ZONEofTECH I was wondering if you can delete the Compass app or do you have to keep it?
ZONEofTECH I will tell you, Why I love to see people get The great smartphone with very high quality Camera on it When I was a child I was get mad when I see people get better than my Phone I said I want better than those people phone, but for now I grow up  I know the better way, I did learned the Life how it will become more beautiful if the People Upgrade the Future, the world mean nothing with people because without PPL it will stay the same forever!
ZONEofTECH :D I know the feeling thrust me. I used to watch dozens of unboxing videos before getting the product I was watching. :D And I still watch a lot of unboxing videos even though I dont own the product :) SUBSCRIBE if you enjoyed my content. I will be posting more unboxing videos in the near future. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH Ahhhh your blocked nose is really annoying lol....
ZONEofTECH thank you so muccch!!!!
ZONEofTECH Hey good video... but it dose not work on my macbook pro with os 10.8.2 i have a samsung 840 series with 500 GB Thanks for help..!
ZONEofTECH Because of your video and included link to Trim Enabler, I could enable TRIM support for my AData 512GB SSD. Thanks for this informative video I have subscribed.
ZONEofTECH Worked for me! 2012 macbook pro with Mountain Lion..... Thanks bro..... (OCZ Vertex 4)
ZONEofTECH War is up. Costs 300 just to fix!
ZONEofTECH iPhone 5s is a good phone tbh but galaxy s5 is much better and faster get it right commenters
ZONEofTECH you should get the iPhone 5C moshimonsterslover10
ZONEofTECH Youre too young to have a phone.........you should be playing with barbie dolls.
ZONEofTECH btw do you live in a fucking airport
ZONEofTECH Is there an airplane taking off behind you?
ZONEofTECH u should give it to me please
ZONEofTECH Hello, Do you use SATA 3 for the ssd?
ZONEofTECH Also, about the movement test, it doesnt really matter for HDDs anymore. Theyve become extremely efficient and accurate and wont fail if you move them unless you throw your laptop out of a window, but the point is SSDs last longer cuz they cant wear down mechanicallyPhysically.
ZONEofTECH Thanks for the video, it was very extensive in details and benchmarks! One note only is that 64 GB of free space may seem inadequate for multimedia usage. For Office usage are ok. I am waiting for the price drop of 840 series 500GB. They are 342 euros now. When they reach 200 euro mark i will take it.
ZONEofTECH nice job! i need your opinion! i bought a laptop  toshiba satellite i5 2.5gh 4gb ram 750hdd 5400 rpm amd 7670 1gb in some games i have litle problems ! if i replace hbb with a ssd ! these problems would be fixed? (sorry for my english)!
ZONEofTECH Whats the name of that song or beat in the background ?
ZONEofTECH WTF, I thought he meant the fruit...grape. Sick people...sick people everywhere...
ZONEofTECH This was awesome. Thanks man. Ive just installed my new ram and ssd following this. I had a bootable usb ready. But the wifi install was so much easier. Awesome..
ZONEofTECH You need a dual layer DVD to burn because I tried a single layer and it says not enough space to burn. I inserted a dual layer 8.5 GB DVD and it burned thanx a lot for the help I thumbed up your video too.
ZONEofTECH are there difference with the scroll wheel with ipod classic?
ZONEofTECH i still use mine up to today 2013
ZONEofTECH Thx, what do you mean by a normal voice?
ZONEofTECH My gpu averages about 4050s celcius is that normal? When i get intense gaming it reaches up to 60s
ZONEofTECH why does it have two usb portals?
ZONEofTECH Hahah, let me know as well if you find out :)) :D
ZONEofTECH Am dying to have this:(
TopGear Yes we dont have skyscrapers

screenjunkies If this was actually a Honest Trailer about Screen Junkies, it wouldve had a line like The most movienitpicky YouTube channel after CinemaSins...
screenjunkies Do Insidious or I will rip off your head and shit down your neck!
screenjunkies Sin: Trailer does not include lap dance.
screenjunkies I know it would be a bit easy but could do Kingdom of Heaven?
screenjunkies Parabns pelas legendas!
screenjunkies kkkkkkkk ,ainda bem q nao vi essa zica.
screenjunkies Where are the vampires? I call bogus.
screenjunkies i have to disagree with your score. id probably go with a 7 for originality. an 8 is pushing it.
screenjunkies And by Billy the Kid, no less.
screenjunkies omfg bill and ted lmfao.
screenjunkies Why cant he complain? He supports screenjunkies by watching their clips, and when they put out shit like this, people complain.
screenjunkies people have probably already asked you this but, please tell me what he said :)
screenjunkies Most of the rest of your content is not very entertaining. Not being rude, just honest.

screenjunkies gj! ill get it too when i come back to germany
retrogametech cynicshminic I absolutely agree. That always happens with the videogame world. I guess that they make so because, once again in a good idea in videogames, they focus on teenagers. I thought about buying it but your words are so true...
retrogametech seriosly you havent heard of myst? its the second most sold pc game ever, its really amazing but you have to have paitence : great vids btw!
retrogametech siebe1998 Yeap its there. Almost all breakthrough,innovative games are in there from every genre. All 90s RPGs from black Isle, all the first FPS are there, as well as strategy, action and adventure games. Team Fortress 1 is even praised in this book.
retrogametech 20robo09 Its not a listchart of the best selling or popular games. Its just a collection of 1001 uniqueweirdgroundbreakingawesome etc games you should try.
retrogametech Call of Duty: Modern Warefare (COD4) Has to be at number 1.
retrogametech i had one of dem dey crap

retrogametech Take that Xbox RROD  at least they dont smoke when they break
screenjunkies Porra, o R  L  J j foi suficiente at pra quem no leu nenhum dos livros :
screenjunkies I loved the first movie of The Hobbit, but they could do just one movie or at least two movies. Three movies are way too many for a short book.
screenjunkies caralho Bilbo roubando de um deficiente mental, nunca olhei por esse angulo

screenjunkies This is great, I wish I had friends like this.
screenjunkies Everyone who hasnt seen the Nostalgia Critics Batman and Robin review needs to check it out now!
screenjunkies Alright screen junkies, uve done honest trailers with red letter media, CinemaSins, HISHE,  Team Four Star. Ppl noticed Mat Pat there in the background. Do an honest trailer with the game theorist! It would have 2 b a video game movie, so do Doom or max Payne or super Mario bros. actually yeah do super Mario bros. but dont rip on Dennis hopper 2 hard
screenjunkies As embarrassing moment go not that bad
screenjunkies Nostalgia critic!!!!!!! So happy now!
screenjunkies I only came here for CinemaSins, HISHE, and JeremyJahns.
screenjunkies At 4:44. . . The boredom factor finally caught up. Sorrryyyy.
screenjunkies I almost left at 0:14
screenjunkies Once i saw jeremyjahns and the nostalgia critic back to back i died of fanboying
screenjunkies We saw him coughing so much my throat started aching.
screenjunkies Essa serie e muito foda
screenjunkies Legen... wait for it... BITCH!
screenjunkies BREAKING BAD SIMPLESMENTE HUMILHA QUALQUER SRIE!Terminou de forma perfeita, maravilhosa, intensa, belssimas atuaes, MERECEM TODOS OS PRMIOS DO MUNDO

screenjunkies o negcio dos dobradores de terra q fazem uma dana infinita para jogar uma pedrinha, tbm reparei isso vendo o filme
screenjunkies is vince vaughn dead? at that point he should of just walked off. what a retarded interview
screenjunkies Something funny in the coments below! Give me my t shirt.
screenjunkies Wow he actually seems like a real person. A lot of the stars at junkets are jerks.
screenjunkies I play a drinking game, where I drink every time Hal blinks... permanently shitfaced...
screenjunkies Haha, it was when he looked at the cameraagent with a WTF look at 2:24.
screenjunkies atleast the last airbender had a cool name, i mean come on..the happening? wtf? something is going on and its not right...making people crazy, a worldwide epidemic causing mass suicide..hmmm lets call it the happening since it happens to be happening at this moment of happeningness..
screenjunkies He got most annoyed when you asked him about Jennifer Anniston
screenjunkies Suddenly I like Vince Vaughn.
screenjunkies Using that FWD Scion XB to drift? HAHAHAHA. Youd have to do an expensive RWD conversion to it like Tanner Fousts TC.
screenjunkies Jeff seem like a cool guy to roll a Heisenberg, what his number?
screenjunkies LOL!! ScreenJunkies finds some actual mechanics to break down the mechanics of The Fast and Furious
screenjunkies worst movie series ever.
screenjunkies Do an honest trailer of iron man 3
screenjunkies All we need is Stallone and we have Fast, Furious and Expendables :)
screenjunkies How much would it cost in modifications to get this thing up to 190mph? I think the fastest way to do that would be to drop it out of a plane Oh man this is fucking gold!
screenjunkies Rock beats paper.. And Vin Diesel
screenjunkies I said it once and Ill say it again, Vin Diesel for Picard.
screenjunkies DO NOT TOUCH THE NEXT GENERATION!! THEY HAVE ALREADY FED UP THE ORIGINAL CAST.
screenjunkies J.J. should reboot the original Battlestar Galactica.
screenjunkies I still think they should bring the original TNG cast together to make So Very Tired. It wouldnt be the twelfth movie, but it would at least be a movie.
screenjunkies Tom Cruise as data??? haaaa
screenjunkies Thunder cats. you guys can choose the cast.
screenjunkies Picard: Ive heard Viggo Mortensen suggested as a possible Picard... I could see that, maybe, but getting a stage actor would probably be the way to go.Riker: Will WheatonData: Michael FassbenderTroi: Thora Birch (will someone PLEASE give her work?)Worf: Idris ElbaLaforge: perhaps Anthony MackieCrusher: Jennifer Tilly (the captains love interest cant be extremely young)Guinan: Keep it Whoopie.And Ill give you a bonus Patrick Wilson as Barclay. Jim Parsons is a wholly worthless actor and you guys should be ashamed for bringing him up. He might do a decent Eugene Victor Tooms, but thats the extent of his reboot usefulness.The one thing a reboot would absolutely need is zero involvement by that vampire J. J. Abrams. A disinterested mercenary director like him might be able to bring in lots of money by stripmining the culture, but he cant create anything new or interesting and whatever he touches turns to crap. Meanwhile, actual creators get shut out. Its a poisonous cycle.
screenjunkies I vote for Jim Parsons (The Big Bang Theory Sheldon Cooper)
screenjunkies ...lets keep it Whoopi... xD That was priceless.
screenjunkies Jj abrams kills movies...
screenjunkies Well, because he literally ASKED THEM and the people said yes and donated. Welcome to democracy.
screenjunkies Good try, Hal. talking about money of people who has it and then asking for it... Nah, lets just call it a try.
screenjunkies Well if your belittling the one so called argument as if its no big deal that major companies shadow smaller ones we have nothing to discuss. Honestly I have no idea why your so up in arms about this move on.
screenjunkies I agree with this in principle. I do not agree to the hypocrisy of your proposed solution. If it were proposed ironically, it would be funny. But, Im pretty sure there is no irony here...
screenjunkies Is this supposed to be satirical?
screenjunkies Telling us not too back someone with lots of money as they can probably afford it by giving you lots of money to do something you can probably afford to do too. Good effort Screen Junkies, lost some faith in you here.
screenjunkies screenjunkies, I dont know your exact purpose (and im willing to admit that, because it isnt important) but an organization hating on one person isnt exactly commendable. You guys let this guy get in front of a camera without any REAL factual evidence that what Zach Braff is doing is wrong. It makes everyone look bad. If this is the guy presenting on behalf of you guys, does that mean that everybody is at his level? or does it even mean that there is even more ignorance behind the scenes?
screenjunkies To all comments I say oh boohoo you pussies. How is this more of a waste then what Zach is doing?
screenjunkies they are literally shoving heads up peoples asses
screenjunkies lol The genius of this film is that the worst parts r all implied rather than shown. highly effective disturbing horror. this film is not for everyone. Extreme horror.
screenjunkies ..Or, this wouldve been the most annoying YouTube video in the world. Two people silently watching a movie for 6 mins! :P
screenjunkies GROSS DUDE SO GROSS .how whud thay take a bath and dude and the chapenies guy tuck a shit in her moth
screenjunkies definitely not a good idea to have tried to watch this whilst eating my breakfast, im sure more came up than went down.
screenjunkies my mom inrtoduced me to game of thrones (we both read the books) it is usally not akward,but once she complained because an extra had obviously fake tits :
screenjunkies What a fucking wanker. Why in the hell would you make your mother watch this bullshit.
screenjunkies Jimmy Tatro is the only good thing in GrownUp 2
screenjunkies DESPICABLE ME WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!
screenjunkies Man of steel was one of my favorite movies. Im a fan of the original but MOS just brings action and epicness. Laser vision!!! Are you kidding me!?
screenjunkies ha iron man 3 1st being a good movie.. hahaha
screenjunkies Why are people bashing the Wolverine? I mean yeah Wolverine Origins SUCKED! But I think this was a good comeback and I liked how it was mostly focused on after The Last Stand... Also sucked, and I loved how it brought in Days of Future Past!
screenjunkies The critics were correct on their Lone Ranger prediction
screenjunkies you got a video for worst sequels? you should if you dont
screenjunkies Summer isnt even over!
screenjunkies Iron man 3 was great, but Man if Steel was AMAZING! Henry Cavill, Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon!
screenjunkies I love how all of them had monsters on their list but didnt talk about it...or despicable me 2.
screenjunkies Class! Whats the song at 3:20?
screenjunkies David Tennant or Matt Smith
screenjunkies Quentin Tarantino or Michael Fassbender
screenjunkies Fat guy : OMFG The Rock!The Rock : Uhh k?Marky Mark : Fucking wrestling fans.
screenjunkies I wish that I could meet Sylvester Stallone. He has been my favorite superhero every since I started remembering things. It was thanks to him that in 1985, the world was exposed to the Motion Analysis Laboratory Technology. That is the computer system that they hooked up to Ivan Drago. In 1996, Shriners Hospitals in Greeneville, South Carolina, used this very same technology to fix my legs that were damaged by Cerebral Palsy. The console and its operator were Russian, and we talked about Ivan Drago. I would like to meet both Stallone and Lungdren, But my hero has always been Mister Balboa!
screenjunkies Adam West and i would say nana nana nana nana BATMAN!
screenjunkies PLEASE LET ME MEET ROBERT DOWNEY JR ANDOR HUGH JACKMAN!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE MAKE MY DREAM COME TRUE!!!!!!!

screenjunkies I like all the characters, but I detest Bran. I wish he wasnt in the book at all.He is a kid.He even walk.He is learning magic. (I dont want disabled Harry Potter)Ever since he left Winterfell, his chapters became a travelogue. He has nothing to add to the story.
screenjunkies John Snow is my favorite, Cerce(?) is really annoying, and Geoffrey needs to die.
screenjunkies Favorites: I havent ever watched the show lol.
screenjunkies this chick is just like what do I do, I know im going to just keep posing and smiling

screenjunkies Well there are many Doctor Who fans that I know who have bashed Star Trek and never seen it, So cut him some slack.
screenjunkies May I ask, which, of the thousands of Star Wars Books would you be referring to? If its anything outside of the Thrawn series it doesnt count because fuck you.
screenjunkies Moogle day, forcing all my friends to say kupo at the end of everything, and somehow even though it will be an american holiday, force the British to do this...as only then it would apply to my friends kupo!
screenjunkies If a vampire bites an unattractive person, do the automatically become attractive?
screenjunkies I cant believe i watched all those movies :x
screenjunkies If you follow the legal system, a man of 100 years old cant have sex with a teenager of 17, that is very strict, even if the teenager is a few month of being 18, if you have sex, you go to jail, period. And you are right, they are shitty characters, and their whole relationship in based in the Mormon dogma, and conservatives believes, like no sex before marriage, and not abortion.
screenjunkies lmao!! to cover up for the shows creepy pedophilia
screenjunkies I watched all the honest trailers of twilight saga! Say Im Daves new best friend

screenjunkies TWENTY SIX FREAKING MINUTES?!?! XD
screenjunkies I came here from Breaking Dawns Honest Trailer expecting a 6 minute long video of stares since theres an overabundance of staring in this franchise, but, wow. Did the actors hate these movies so much that they went out of their way to avoid acting in them? cause thats the vibe Im getting.
screenjunkies Omg I only made it 2.30 minutes in...
screenjunkies Made it to 04:43. I feel like a champ. A disgusting champ.
screenjunkies Aww! Love this overview of The Twilight Saga in 26:13! Thank you for doing this!!!
screenjunkies 1:13 for me XD couldnt take it any longer :DD
screenjunkies this video made me so uncomfortable with the awkward silences.
screenjunkies your picture is just perfect
screenjunkies FYI: youd better not criticize Travoltas pronounciation of les mis, since he rolls the r in a way that sounds better than you... (And I AM french, so I know what Im talking about ) )
screenjunkies Most Awkward award should have gone to Melissa Mcarthy and Paul Dudds jokes. God that sucked.
screenjunkies YOU SHOULD HOST!!!!!That would be an amazing show... :)
screenjunkies Not Chris tucker or Chris rock, definitely not. Trey Parker or Matt Stone.
screenjunkies We want Affleck! More Affleck! YOU MADE BATFLECK HAPPEN!
screenjunkies Chuck Norris as the next host!!
screenjunkies Is there a reason u called Barbara Streisand Barbara Walters??
screenjunkies It would be so awesome if Ellen DeGeneres hosted the Oscars again, shes awesome!
screenjunkies Gambit fact, True story. They messed up a great xmen character. WolverineOrigins
screenjunkies I understand what she means about Deadpools blades being longer than his forearms, but technically, Wolverine shouldnt be able to bend his wrists with how long his claws are, and we let that slide...
screenjunkies deathstroke and batman
screenjunkies i agree with Allyson but, calm down woman..
screenjunkies Yes, the way they used deadpool in the wolverine origins pissed me off, like, he needed his mouth and please give him his costume and his swords and some sense of humor! goddamnit marvel
screenjunkies I want some Carnage. Thats all I ever wanted
screenjunkies Deadpool, Cable, Wolverine with the Punisher and Nick Fury.
screenjunkies Id have to go with Captain America, Tony Stark, and Wolverine. Plus begin to work Pepper Pots into her roll as Rescue!
screenjunkies 1:12  He asked how many times youve been in love, not how many times youve picked up a guy in a bar and had a one night stand. She doesnt even know what Back to the Future is. I dont care how hot you are, thats inexcusable.
screenjunkies 1.Dirty Dancing2.Say Anything...3.Twilight4.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind5.The Terminator6.Star Wars7.Back to the Future
screenjunkies that youre great on oral sex...you are the man, man :p
screenjunkies When will hal and the random chick valentines day honest trailer come out?
screenjunkies OMG SHE DIDNT GET THE BACK TO THE FUTURE REFERENCE :O BLASPHEMY.
screenjunkies Is Brenna trying to look like a hen?
screenjunkies Ive just realised that you can literally justify any situation with the line well it doesnt matter because Im Patrick Swayze.
screenjunkies Id like to see Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs go on a date with Catherine Martin from Silence of the Lambs. Lots of uncomfortable silences, they could eat liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti. Buffalo Bill would bring her a gift of lotion in a basket.
screenjunkies You absolutely have no taste in movies arsehole! I just fucking unsubscribed, get a new host not an arse!
screenjunkies this is actullay the first time i know who the director for lone ranger is i seriously thought is was burton

screenjunkies Superbowl1 Champions league groupe stage game between two teams from eastern europe
screenjunkies The best half time show would be 2 hours long sandwiched between 15 minutes of football.
screenjunkies best half time show: The football field blowing up. Bane could do it!
screenjunkies Infinite rocks? Seriously this guy never watched The Rock in the WWF
screenjunkies Beyonces was nothing special IMO
screenjunkies Witches  people who took Dungeons and Dragons characters too seriously and were made fun of for it. Thus they sat inside too long on the internet and WHAM! You have goatneckcutters.
screenjunkies Youve seen Charmed but you havent seen Buffy?! Go Hal Rudnick!!
screenjunkies I didn t know asking something in Greek qualifies as a spell :pI hope these girls have some other powers to go with Greek, because I know about 10 million people for which asking things in Greek does not work...
screenjunkies At least the witches in the movies were far more pretty, sry :P
screenjunkies The guy interviewing them is such a tool.
screenjunkies Im not the biggest fan of witchcraft, but Hansel and Gretel was some sucky movie.
screenjunkies Mind fuck, Buff and Charmed was on the same channel, and this chick didnt know !!!!
screenjunkies Omfg, lost my Shit. Fucking idiots!!!
screenjunkies unrealistic . . .Skanks with rotting bodies flying on broom sticks, gizmos and gadgets that never existed in any century, and a troll the size of Dwayne Johnson. Somehow I dont think they were going for realism. XD And for all the real life version of witches that exist, there is OBVIOUSLY the fictional, fairytale version that gets used by Hollywood.
screenjunkies Rip their head of and drop a Duce down their neck
screenjunkies to kill the zombie: annoy them to death with Justin bieber music
screenjunkies Now thats just cruel, you heartless bastartd!!!!!
screenjunkies Best way to kill a zombie is to drop a paino on its head. Old school but effective.
screenjunkies This is retarded and unfunny.
screenjunkies Anyone who thinks this is actually real is pretty slow and is obviously not familiar with Rob Corddry.
screenjunkies Walking dead is not bullshit it is actuly it is more realistic
screenjunkies Strap them down and make them listen to jb

screenjunkies Vanilla sky action figure with detatchable deformed face?
screenjunkies BTW, that lttle wave he does at the end of the videos... yeah, it woke up my xbox.
screenjunkies Game of thrones with removable penises.
screenjunkies I dont think Tarantinos role in Django was meant to be solid. It was comic relief. Not saying comedies have a pass, but its like Shakespeare. You have an intense story until it gets boring. The boring point is where you add in the comic relief. It was like that in Pulp Fiction, but Ill say Tarantinos acting in Pulp Fiction was much better.
screenjunkies I highly disagree about Milla Jovovich. Maybe the movie was bad, but Milla plays her role as Alice really really good. The plot holes and goofs about her character arent her fault. She made the best out of it.
screenjunkies Well, you need these bad movies in order to appreciate the good ones.
screenjunkies FUCK YOU YOU STUPID LITTLE BITCH I bet you know fuck all about spider man, or the comics or anything. And the arent copying and pasting they are staying true to the origin, what do you want, for them to do it differently then Marc web would get so much black lash. You dumb fuck, stick to Star Wars which I bet you also not little about
screenjunkies I thought Cloud Atlas was very well made and it stuck to the source material
screenjunkies Here is one for the future,Ben Affleck in Man Of Steel 2.
screenjunkies worst picture: Gravity
screenjunkies The games playing itself Jon. THE GAMES PLAYING ITSELF!
screenjunkies The Amazing SpiderMan sucked, Andrew Garfield made Peter Parker look like a fucking asshole. The entire cast sucked except for Gwen Stacey, the lizard, and Dennis Leary.
screenjunkies whats with the fake hand?
screenjunkies .. um what a weird fake hand.. you shoulda atleast done something with it.. like something neat.. instead of just having a fake hand for no reason at all
screenjunkies Die Hard 6 title Just die or die trying
screenjunkies They should do a Die Hard version of Last Action Hero, its 2020 and a the last die hard movie is made, Die Hard 12, and its terrible. all cgi crap, including a cgi Bruce Willis. Then a kid goes to see it and magicly falls into the movie and teaches John mclane about his roots, and how Die Hard should be, slowly the movie turns to be good, and the cgi bruce turns into a real bruce. STUPID I KNOW! But it would be so funny, and who knows, might be good!
screenjunkies If you are a Die Hard fan you might want to watch this :P http:youtu.be67EMdxF7inQ LOOOL I totally AGREE WITH YOU :)diehard5
screenjunkies Die Hard: Electric Boogaloo Die Harder Than The Previous Die Hard Die Hardcules in New York Die Hard Boiled Egg

screenjunkies Taylor Kitschs career cant be over, Riggins will bounce back
screenjunkies Totally agree with you on 1.  Battleship was just as stupid at Transformers, but since it didnt have the same title, it bombed. I really liked Prometheus.

screenjunkies i would totally do anna kendrick

screenjunkies Refeferencia a Game of Thrones hahaaahhahahahaha
screenjunkies Enquanto O Hobbit  A Desolao de Smaug no chega, vamos relembrar um pouco da saga dos Anis.Olha esse aqui, Amanda Nunes ...:D
screenjunkies Os erros de Titanic e The Godfather em geral so erros que tem a ver com filmagem e questes de ambientao. Os erros de The Dark Knight Rises so furos de roteiro. E furos de roteiro so menos perdoveis do que erros de ambientao e filmagem. Principalmente vindos da mesma equipe que fez obras primas como Amnsia.
screenjunkies Quanta baboseira, coisa da gerao michael bay mesmo. nesse site foi explicado td:
screenjunkies I drank to both. crazy night
screenjunkies leslie mann is hot. i want to drink with her and then let her wax me.
screenjunkies Every character is Eddie Murphy with a Brendan Fraser cameo.
screenjunkies Judd Apatow sounds just like Seth Rogan
screenjunkies What a fantastic interview. You might have noticed how the three of them started off cold and a little annoyed. Most people get bored at press junkets very quickly. But through Rudnicks silly questions and antics you see the three celebrities let their guard down. While drinking and being goofy they reveal much more about themselves than they would have through answering a typical questionnaire. Well done screenjunkies.
screenjunkies Hal Rudnick as Data in TNG reboot
screenjunkies Awesome video, as always. You are AWESOME Hal! WAX ON, WAX OFF
screenjunkies I dont think drinking is legal on the internet Da fuk. grow some balls!

screenjunkies ooohhh that Schindlers List joke swing and a foul ball
screenjunkies You dont know what youre talking about. My family is from Drishane, Parish of Shull, County Cork on Dunmanus Bay. Im Irish Catholic and youre probably an idiot Orangeman. Theyre all idiots. BTW, know why my user name is ANPGhost? Google ANP and find out.

screenjunkies The guy acts like an asshole Cant stop laughing
screenjunkies I do not want to have future daughters like them...I cant even deal with my friends fangirl over 1D.
screenjunkies Im kinda ashamed to know most of the answers.
screenjunkies actors from twilight helping ask questions for this video that is kinda making fun of twilight? lol
screenjunkies Best ending would be  You got Punkd! Haha, still with this ending the dads are the poor ones, cus thy need to with them to premiere.
screenjunkies Dude these girls are not excited enough!!! Me and over a THOUSAND fans camped out on the streets of LA for 4 days just to stand on the red carpet and these girls just were given tickets to go to the premiere and the AFTERPARTY! They should be sobbing uncontrollably if they are actually real diehard fans!
screenjunkies Fell sorry for the dads.

screenjunkies This was hilarious because they probably could have gotten hurt and would have deserved it. Yes they were being dicks running off with stuff and messing with people who were on the phone but hey, its funny to watch.
screenjunkies This is the most boring prank, if I can eve call this like that, what ive ever seen.
screenjunkies Some stuff was funny most of it was just stolen from loiter squad.
screenjunkies Some funny bits but a lot of it was just pissing nice people off.
screenjunkies its funny when u tell people is a joke and people are all happy but its NOT A PRANK when you go around ruining peoples day and stealing there shit
screenjunkies this video WOULDA been funny if the guy with the tattoo on his arms that yelled at them actually swung a couple rounds at the douchebags

But unfortunately it seems it is only possible to upgrade to be a hippy or maybe buddist or theist if youre lucky seems there is no capitalist upgrade the capitalist program is destroyed automatically since it isnt future proof

screenjunkies Could you please do the Hannibal Lector trilogy? Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal? Thanks and I really enjoy your videos!
screenjunkies Plzzzz do honest trailer warm bodies
screenjunkies I agree what Nick is talking about in transformers shouldnt be a comedic movie that they have to put in a black like stereo type character to make the movie comical and its kinda funny how that transformer robot name is jazz since the genre jazz is music that was made by black people and yet he was the one to die but the movie should be dark, gritty, adultlike, serious tone.
screenjunkies Hate to say this, but i like the 1986 version more than the live action ones.
screenjunkies I have to say it, i like that movie had romance, but not force the comedy. And be more visual the action, but trasformers neve will touch pacific rim
screenjunkies How about a love story between Transformers and America? They did that already in the first three! Agree about the Dinobots though  wholeheartedly.
screenjunkies 1st movie was good I saw that 10 time at the cinema, 2nd meh just 2 times the third was a one watch for me so Im not so sure what to expect
screenjunkies Why does he love Michael Bay? Guy hasnt done a really good movie since Bad Boys.
screenjunkies We need a new reboot with another director, I agree with everything in this videoP.s. i hate that Shockwave never transformed and for him to be so feared he got taken out so easily, he only had like 10 minutes of screen play throughout the whole movie and why Cybertron look like a disco waffle ball
screenjunkies Do a How to fix AlienPrometheus
screenjunkies Nick mundy is the man !!!!

screenjunkies Not even a mention to lord Baelish? Hes like the most badass motherfucker in the show!
screenjunkies I know I might get a bit of hate but I really think Danerys would be a shit queen. She doesnt know shit about leading a kingdom. In reality, I think Tywin should be king. Hes the most capable one. Cruel, but capable. Even he thought that Joffrey was a shit
screenjunkies do this for the walking dead season 4
screenjunkies Favorite scene is when Kaleesi reveal that she could understand every word the king was saying . Such a bad ass woman!
screenjunkies Tyrion King Slapper is totally my favorite! :D
screenjunkies Never watched game of thrones but now I gotta start watching it.

screenjunkies Fucking love u dude hilarious
screenjunkies id REALLY like to see star wars the clone wars (animated series) as an honest tv trailer!
screenjunkies They must of payed yall a cool million to lie on camera like this...this movie is gonna SUUUUUUUUCK!
screenjunkies Americans dont even give stuff a chance before they start running their dam mouths. Everybody is saying its going to be bad like they can see into the dam future. How about u lazy opinionated fucks get off your couch and go try to create something better sheesh
screenjunkies When I first saw the trailer I thought through its intro, Is this The Dark Knight? This movie looks pretty bad. I mean just look at the Turtles faces their so ugly!
screenjunkies Well...I might just watch it, if that the case
screenjunkies GET MEGAN FOX OUT THE MOVIE!! and fix their ugly faces.. i mean i know they are mutants, but i dont wanna be afraid of their faces :(
screenjunkies I will see this movie. I dont care about the reviews how good put bad they see. Ive been a Ninja Turtles fan since I was a kid.
screenjunkies Why is no one talking about the fact that the two dimensional Megan Fox is playing April Oneill
screenjunkies I like it when I saw Leo and I could get behind him, but mickeys nose just does not work. I am hoping they show in the next trailer more of all four brothers. Also more about the shredder.
screenjunkies could it be worse than 1998 Godzilla?...
screenjunkies Ok, Do Captain America: the Winter Soldier now.And good luck this movie is awesome.
screenjunkies do mean girls to celebrate the 10th anniversary

screenjunkies 90 yearl old virgin LOL i was wondering that when i saw that movie XD
screenjunkies The scene at 1:00 where the guy on the left has a big ol camel toe!I cant unsee that, bitch.WTF.
screenjunkies Frozen... where the guy jumps from the cable car, to when he is being eaten by the wolves. I had nightmares of that.
screenjunkies The scene in Trainspotting when hes locked in his childhood room with the dead baby on the ceiling.
screenjunkies The most fed up scene Ive ever seen is from A Serbian Film. This scene can be summed up in two words: Newborn Porn. Ugh.
screenjunkies i guess i was warned, but why did i watch this
screenjunkies Every single scene from Cannibal Holocaust
screenjunkies Vhs 2 cult scene. That was some freaky shit!
screenjunkies How do I put this? Most things described here are the obvious choices, lets dig deeper. Lets say Louis Malles fed up Black Moon. After Lily discovers the dead girl which is eaten by the chickens, brother Lily (everybodys name is Lily) buries her in an already prepared grave, Lily cannot stand the burial, she runs to a huge pig and falls to the ground, gets beaten up by imaginary naked children, kicks a tree, steps on some crying flowers and finally meets the unicorn. The first thing the unicorn says is that Lily is mean for running after it, for beating up the children (?), kicking the tree and destroying the flowers, while the unicorn itself is eating flowers from the ground. Their conversation gets weirder and weirder until someone throws a plate on Lily. That someone is an old lady, who died and was somehow resurrected by drinking breast milk out of her daughter earlier (sister Lily). The unicorn suggests that the old lady isnt real at all. Ive seen a lot of fed up st in my life but this movie made me fall in love with Cinema once again, you dont need drugs for watching this, this movie is the only drug you need.
screenjunkies One opinion is enough, your opinion (the talking head) is all we need.I dont want to tune in and listen to a panel! This format sucks on real TV and now it is popping up everywhere on Youtube.Sorry, but YOUR panel is US the subscribers, and the opinions we want to hear are from other subscribers in the comments colum.This really could have been a fun relevant post and maybe only five minutes long.Instead it was padded and laime while your topic was brilliant.Fail.
screenjunkies But he is John McClain u see.

screenjunkies Guardians is going to POP like a popcorn machine with free butter!
screenjunkies I thought the trailer looked good, but to be honest I didnt know anything about these characters until a couple of years ago since Im not a comic book guy. I hope the movie is going to be good but I cant judge until after I see it.
screenjunkies the lack of nose on groot reminds me too much of HeWhoShallNotBeNamed...
screenjunkies Did he spit on them at 6:22 when he said POP!?
screenjunkies Cant wait for this movie to bomb. I want that so badly.Bootista sucks. No one knows these characters. Really hope people dont want to see a Marvel comedy. Yes, Im a hater.
screenjunkies From viewing Guardians of the Galaxy trailer, these group of traveling space mercinares almost share parallel attitudes like Star Wars mercinaes and smugglers from two universes. So, yeah it might pop in a successful story telling way.
screenjunkies So looking forward to sexy nebula akaa gorgeous gillan
screenjunkies These guys dont know shit. Drax is the Wolverine of the team, not the Colossus. Gamora is Thanoss adopted daughter. Star Lord doesnt think highly of himself and originally Groot said a lot more than, I am Groot.
screenjunkies rocket and groot  teemo and maokai
screenjunkies This sums up the movie pretty well, o still enjoyed it tho (dont judge me)
screenjunkies ... or someone elses phone on the bus.
screenjunkies your so mean but its funny
screenjunkies Please do Enders Game

GameSack I never though Maester Lewin would die, I liked him and it saddened me so much!
retrogametech There is something very appealing about the graphics on a Vectrex. Good job dude )
retrogametech RetroGameTech Since you didnt had the time to reply to my message i send you on your Channel, i go ahead and ask here again.How hard is it actualy to repair Consoles.. because, lets just say, i nearly know nothing and want to jump right into it, not for the gain of money, but to learn something about it.Cheers
retrogametech 35? Thats like, 54? You lucky bastard!
retrogametech What a great find and so easy to repair! :)If you are looking for a flash cart check out the VecMulti or Mateos rewriteable Multicart on my channel in case you dont know that stuff already.
retrogametech Awesome , been waiting for this since you first tweeted about it a while back.I love your videos man you inspire me to take my consoles repair needs into my own hands. Never paying repair fees again.
retrogametech WOW they didnt check the plug before they sold it?
retrogametech Im not envious, honestly !
retrogametech Great to see you back, Martin! You have been missed!And congratulations on your Vectrex score, with what may be the easiest fix Ive seen you execute yet. :)
retrogametech Watch out your going to catch the Vectrex bug! I have it and I love the system! You haft to check out all the homebrews for it!! Plus the Vectrex has a amazing library of original games also!!
retrogametech How you got what you wanted in both balls I will never know! :P Great to have you back by the way!
retrogametech you really got the two best statues there :D
retrogametech Make more videos more frequently plz
retrogametech did u met with ashens in poundland? :D
retrogametech I keep seeing Pokemon ones of these near Coop.
retrogametech I used to have one of those same GBA movie players. It worked great for about 3 or 4 years, but it died on me.
retrogametech Good to see you back mate
retrogametech Hi there.. Where are you from actually?? Uk??
retrogametech Good to see you back mate! Ive missed my dose of awesome hardware mods : )
retrogametech Soon as they are available in France
retrogametech Its like looking through a box of memories from past videos! Great to see youre back, hope you had a good New Year! Sometimes its nice to take a break from YouTube.
retrogametech Hey what hard shell case are you using for your back lit modded GBA? (The black one). Ive got a backlit GBA and am really needing a hard carrying case for it and that one looks perfect. What brand is it?
retrogametech i also am a hardware collector. i like putting use to consoles that have been forgotten and neglected by others. but i do limit myself to one of each model and colour. Ive got one of each game boy color, except for the limited ones like the pokemon exclusive.
retrogametech i think i saw an ngage game at playnation games in croydon, london but cant remember which one though
retrogametech Is that limited edition GBA the 1001 model (backlit)? looks awesome. Have yet to track down a decent priced one of those.
retrogametech Wouldnt it be cool if there was the ultimate hybrid! It has a ROM dumper box thing and features of the EZFlash4 with no need for patching and the cartridge has a built in DS card for DS action and also works on the 3DS! As a bonus you could pop your DS games into the GBA cart which then plugged into the reader for DS dumps! Ohh and the DS cart has an SD card so you can replace it if it burns out or you flash it too many times :D
retrogametech Make a new video please!!!
retrogametech Great news....your last vid inspired me to get my old ez flash 2 cart working and I used an old laptop and now run xp on it....playing wario ware and GTA on my micro has been great fun...keep up the great work with these videos.....
retrogametech Yah you found the software. Thats really cool!
retrogametech I got a mega old Flash cart that links to a PC via a daisy chain, also one that only saves save files :SI might have the files to my one somewhere, but have you looked on codejunkies at all? The Datel versions of USB software often works with these flash devices!
retrogametech awesome stuffs, i wana get a smart card for my gameboy soon :)
retrogametech pm me i have the softwear bad thing is it only works on xp
retrogametech Do you have the EZ FLash software? I have one but I cant find it anywhere and I have one laying around. Thanks!
retrogametech Where can i get one of these nowadays?
retrogametech Dude you could Theoretically dump a rom with that.
retrogametech i dont think it came with any software originally i found a website:http:www.madeinchina.comshowroomwangwei198019productdetailCqonEMuTsxliChinaSmartCardFrw1861s.html
retrogametech Oh wait, just realised you can post links in these comments now!Hey man, Its a long shot but here is a few sites that may have what youre looking for:http:mynewdata.tripod.comsoftware.htmhttp:www.hkems.comdownload2020Transferer2012.htmI dont have one myself to test any of this but hopefully you find what youre looking for. Thanks for the great uploads, always enjoy your videos!Best of luck,Sean.
retrogametech Strider games are good ones to pick up these days. the PS1 strider 2 goes for 4080 and not many are around. with the new Strider coming out prices and demand might keep going up.
retrogametech Buriki one is better than you think, its actually very good once you get used to the controls. good luck finding samsho 64,awesome game aswell :)
retrogametech You show it with your SLG.
retrogametech Yeah, it looks like it should be good but theres something just a little off with the game. Kinda sad.
retrogametech See the main issue I have is not the fact the bootleg is a bootleg but if your good at making a bootleg then make one that works
retrogametech Ive got a DS one that proudly says 168 games NO REPEAT!! on it. Theyre all NES games in a DS emulator  if you press the shoulder buttons the emulators menu pops up :) The best one Ive got is the 32inone GB cart that has such nonhits as Tom  Rat, Violent Bump and Swiftly Hop. Its weird because theres 6 real games, the rest are duplicates... but with no hacks in the duplicates.
retrogametech Man, I really need to get back into Gameboy Advanced... WHERE ARE MY GAMECUBE CABLES!!
retrogametech Youre right i am too greedy with your videos, i just really enjoy them.
retrogametech Never heard of it. Ill check it out, thanks!
retrogametech I really enjoyed the new format, it makes the video much more enjoyable to watch, not that it wasnt already of course!
retrogametech How you spoil us with all these videos :D
retrogametech Yup, and I play em on my Gamecube with the GBA adapter, on a Commodore monitor... looks great!
retrogametech damn that modem was dusty!ahhaahaaha  just fuckin with you ...that is a clean and sweet set up...great video and setup!
retrogametech I know that you cant reply but do you think that you can do a tutorial video on how to mod the ps3 please. Ive been looking around and there is none. I also really trust you.
retrogametech What a waste of money!.......................... said no gamer ever :D
retrogametech Hang on the PS2s Network Adapter doesnt have SATA. It has IDE on it. Pretty sure.
retrogametech They have TONS of them! :P
retrogametech Only 100? I swear, I could strangle you right now. That was a steal, man!
retrogametech 7 consoles stacked? Haha, awesome. Thanks for watching :)
retrogametech It was about 25 from Argos about 3 years ago I think )
retrogametech Nope, thats actually a Retro Lancer. Hammerbursts dont have bayonets.
retrogametech when it comes to most console innovations they have always been there first funnily enough.
retrogametech You can sometime find them kinda cheap on Ebay. You just have to keep watching and youll get lucky eventually. 50 actually isnt too bad considering how long collectible Dreamcast stuff has become in recent years. All in I paid about 20 for mine a several years back and that was a really good deal then.
retrogametech Very true. The little webcam even doubles as a standalone portable digital camera. Back in 2000 that would have been pretty mind blowing!
retrogametech The top 3 most rare gamesgame systems in your collection
retrogametech Haha, yeah thats a bit random. Not sure what thats all about.
retrogametech Im all about adding more boxes to the corner :) . 30 was just too tempting a deal for me to resist. Granted, a year from now Ill be digging through my cupboard and the phrase wtf is this? will be uttered.
retrogametech Sadly you can only get 4 games for that hardware, probably why they are cheap, but if you like the 4 games or just 1 of them excellent, I decided against getting one as I prefer the MVS anyway and there is plenty more for that as you probably already know anyway.
retrogametech Mr GameTech I have a game gear that is broken and I want it to work I attempted to fix it but Im a big NOOB and I was wondering if I could send it to you for you to fix and send back and record it
retrogametech Dude, where were you last year? There was a guy on eBay selling a ton of these brand new with two games (other one being Samurai Showdown) for a tenner! I also got a copy of Bikuri One for 3 loose.
retrogametech And an expensive set at that! :P
retrogametech Nice vid and pickup. It is a real shame they didnt produce more games for them  thats what puts me off buying one, and I think is why the price can be low on these. If you like the few games you can play on each one its worth it I guess, personally I think the best game is Beast Busters 2nd but not sure what main board that works on.
retrogametech What kind of JAMMA thingy do I need? Im new to this :(
retrogametech 1500!?!?! Wow, bargain! haha. I know what you mean. The games arent all that great although its still a very cool piece of Neo Geo history. But it doesnt even come close to the awesome MVS! :)
retrogametech My friend have a problem lately: when I have played Megadrive, when I push to one side of the control  B  C pause the game. Play Hang On sucks because I can not make turns driving the booster and so on. Some information:  Ive already tested various controls and the problem persists, then control is not defective  In the 2nd control is the same problem as I put Sonic 2 to test the command and when the game was paused too.
retrogametech and has to make the switch this chip? Because I think this is the problem.
retrogametech no, just this limited edition one.
retrogametech I saw your face in the DPad!
retrogametech Dude youre videos are a treat i always get so excited when i see one in my sub box. My nipples get erect from the sound of your voice.
retrogametech I did and still do :) . No I dont play online anymore. I dont do videos repairing Sony Handhelds because theres not much resale value in the PSPVita. And my own PSPGo works just fine :)
retrogametech Yes, some methods seem unorthodox but if care is taken then usually theres little risk of damage.
retrogametech I love this controller, I use it on my PC with Steam big picture for action games etc :)
retrogametech I had an Famicom replica :D i got it 96 :3 i lived at the time in Ukrain
retrogametech China is the king of knockoffs.
retrogametech Thank You :) greets from Poland :)
retrogametech I didnt know that, thanks. :)
retrogametech Thank you! Glad you like them. Hello from Scotland :)
retrogametech I know its weird. There must be a big market for them somewhere in the world. Id like to visit one of the stores that still sells all those crazy bootleg carts with bizarre ROM hacks.
retrogametech I dont know what they did but the whole site is messed up for me these days. My feed misses out loads of vids. And anything that does show up and I dont watch within 24hrs simply disappears! Plus, lots of vids are now plastered with those really freakn annoying little annotation box adverts. Google are totally killing the community aspect of the YouTube. Anyone with a smaller channel looking to increase their viewer baseshare content is basically screwed.
retrogametech LOL, the 32xSega Channel stack at the end.
retrogametech I was hoping this Mega Drive X would have Mega Man X. l
retrogametech I didnt realize you could rip the HDD out of a sky box... Keep the videos coming!
retrogametech Your new subs must come from that Larry Bundy Jr chap :)
retrogametech Ive been on YouTube a few years and it always seems to happen around this time of year. Strange.
retrogametech If your going for all the WayForward games on DS you still need Adventure Time.
retrogametech I hardly see these deals on ebay us, i guess ebay uk and ebay us dont intermingle at all in search results.
retrogametech I think theyre maybe a bit overrated because of nostalgia. The controls and gameplay are tight but I personally cant stand the art style. It really irritates me for some reason.
retrogametech Some really cool stuff , learned some cool stuff aswell like the harddrive test box.stay cool dude peace
retrogametech I guess its all subjective. I would disagree. As platformers go, I found it very bland and tedious in comparison to other GBA titles from the same genre. To me even the modern Nintendo platformers are subpar when compared to the likes of what WayForward and smaller indie devs are producing these days. Im a big platformer and Nintendo fan btw. All personal opinion of course! :)
retrogametech My Sky box is rocking 3TB.
retrogametech Every now and then they end up selling failed addon peripherals like the GH on Tour bundle and that Rock Band keyboard for Wii. I found some really nice Halo 4 figures in there the other day for 4.
retrogametech A lovely woman owning a game gear ? Marry Me ! :D
retrogametech Ive got a Manchester United limited edition Game Boy. Is this worth anything?
retrogametech I was quite surprised that the Uk DS covers are the same size as The NTSC ones. Tempted to put my games in US boxes to save space.
retrogametech Alright thanks man! Ive been watching, just not commenting. I was thinking of getting all the variants for my collection but didnt have money at that time.
retrogametech Can we see the pictures you retrieved?
retrogametech I know ive never seen any, going to go check mine out tomorrow
retrogametech Just picked up Metal Slug 7 last weekend.
retrogametech XG Blast NTSC is available on the American Amazon, not sure if theyll ship to the UK though
retrogametech Oh hey I have one of these, i was watching one of your previous vids and wondering why you were saying that sps werent backlit, when mine was
retrogametech o3o i have one of these and i just found out that it is special
retrogametech a sweet find mate, didnt know they existed :)
retrogametech Had an AGS001 as a kid and I recently found it in my garage. Also found an AGS101 on the sidewalk near school, pocketed it. I also have a Micro. Just need to find that damn original GBA I used to own and Ill have the set.
retrogametech Very cool! Definitely have to get me one of those 101s one day.
retrogametech in small markets as Greece ebay is my friend.
retrogametech No, my PC is barely capable of rendering these videos! haha.
retrogametech what is your mane on ebay? and do you ship to denmark
retrogametech Is that picture run through an upscaler? It looks fantastic
retrogametech Yeah there was some sound but it was distorting and glitching out. I discovered that any time the cart was moved it caused issues. Putting pressure on that spot with the crack fixed stopped the distortion. Haha, there was no way I was going to spend a whole day reworking the mess under that BIOS chip. Yep, the other board was a 5V unit but had 1 bad transistor on the daughter board. The replacement part was going to cost me 10 with shipping! Easiercheaper just to convert the board to 9V :)
retrogametech Wow who ever had that Geo before you really hurt it :( glad you got a nice profit in the end! I should blog the two xboxes I got and the out come :) nice video man!
retrogametech Wouldve been more convenient to have a setting you can toggle instead of doing that each time
retrogametech Hey RGT what ROM carts are you using? are they any good? i have been looking for a ROM cart for use with my GBA and i have not decided on what to use.
retrogametech Great little gen you discovered. Ive not bought any virtual console games. But thats pretty neat. I wouldnt have bothered researching it either so I doubt Id have come across the feature. Thanks! Btw have you heard about the Sega SMS classics being released on 3DS with their 3D depth added back again? Pretty cool!
retrogametech I went to go find Shantae in the eShop after watching this video and the promotional artwork in the shop for the game includes a giant screenshot of the game with the Gameboy Color border around it :D
retrogametech Thanks for uploading this trick! Really cool easter egg! I actually just bought Shantae last night and this is definitely the way Ill be playing the rest of the game. I actually got into WayForward because of YOU! I heard the background music you were playing of Mighty Switch Force in one of your videos and it lead me all the way to Shantae. :) Keep the videos coming! Your channel is great!
retrogametech You are indeed a strange person! :P 4:3 FTW!
retrogametech actually you just need to hold start dude, select is unneeded
retrogametech Glad I could help. It really bothers me too!
retrogametech 3ds xl works so much better with this.
retrogametech Thanks :) The wireless pads are great. Featured them in a pickups vid last year I think. About November time if youre interested.
retrogametech See my reply to Darius Davis below :)
retrogametech Will it work with both NTSC and PAL?
retrogametech Well it half worked I guess :D nice to know she will be stock once more so you can appreciate her for the holy grail of clones she is :D
retrogametech Thanks. Due to the freezing I doubt it is a video sync issue. I think it is probably the CPU of the clone being clocked too fast or slow for the 32X.
retrogametech Damn that looks complicated the only complicated thing Ive ever done is backlight a gbc
retrogametech He got so lost on the keyboard Im surprised he found his way to the dislike button. Hope he got out ok.
retrogametech Great video! Probably need to get a scope or logic analyser onto the case here. (posted this before but it seems to have got deleted???).
retrogametech Get Manhunt 2! The best! And Resident Evil Archives!
retrogametech Id say xenoblade, but finding a cheap copy will be pretty difficult.
retrogametech Bit.trip will do that to you, the rage quit LOL but it really does remind me of old school games in its difficulty. And yes, Fragile Dreams is the one that scared me, I was playing it in a dark candlelit room alone just to let my imagination run away (I watch horror movies the same way)
retrogametech Is that a remake of the arcade game?
retrogametech Ive played it but like I mentioned Im really not into Mario. I know theyre well made games but they hold no nostalgia for me and I actually really dislike the art style. Dont ask why, the wee guy just irritates me, haha.
retrogametech Bargaintastic!! Ghost squad can be picked up cheap and is a great gun game, BUT just read that you already have it :))
retrogametech Got it and love it! The House of the Dead games are reason enough to buy a Wii :)
retrogametech I loved de Blob, but but some reason I didnt find the second game as engaging, even though the controls were better and there were more things to do. I cant quite glean your overall opinion of platformers from this video but I think Wario Land: The Shake Dimension is one of the best. I also thought A Boy and his Blob was excellent, but that was probably equal parts good puzzle platforming and nostalgia.
retrogametech De Blob is a pretty decent game, just with a few dodgy controls :( I have the sequel on PS3 and would recommend it, especially at its relatively low price!
retrogametech Thats cool, didnt know this existed.
retrogametech Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon! )
retrogametech how is the sound quality?
retrogametech I remember when it came out, that and the DS internet browser
retrogametech Great, very clear and louder than the GBAs default output. On par with any other modern MP3 player.
retrogametech the cart itself has a headphone jack. he showed it in the video.
retrogametech so they made an mp3 player for the gameboy sp which has no headphone jack
retrogametech I went back to check, and it was a different animal altogether when I took it out of the box. The thing was massive.
retrogametech It was probably only released in limited numbers to get a feel for interest. It looks like a variant of the Playyan from Japan. Haha, an odd question, but ok. To be honest I dont think I ever was. I was subbed to your old channel I believe.
retrogametech I might make a portable (so original) GameCube. Using the classic folding screen top, and a laptop battery. Maybe even shorter cord lengths for the controllers. Probably never gonna do it, but its just an idea I had.
retrogametech It is ok somebody buying a Mega CD or a CDi today and saying how bad the systems are, you need to had had them on release to really under stand them and that they were good for their time and are still good for people who have the memories to go with them
retrogametech There was a add on for it that lets you play Nintendo games can you find one?
retrogametech Dangerous stuff!! Watch one episode and before you know it youre 2 seasons in and trapped in a YouTube vortex!! :P
retrogametech You can still watch it on YouTube :P And its weirdly even more enjoyable to watch now! haha
retrogametech where can you buy one of these?
retrogametech Brings back memories of that Bad Influence episode all them years ago seeing this clone console. When I first started watching this video I was saying to myself I have seen this clone somewhere before and trying to think where before you had mentioned the Bad Influence episode they showed it on.
retrogametech I remember that episode of bad influence that and games master witch was my favourite gaming show.
retrogametech Whats the story with that tiny Japanese Batman Mega Drive case? Ive never seen those before.
retrogametech harry,the lcd screen is for the modchip thats in the xbox,its a optional purchase when you buy the chip
retrogametech Cant be having that! :P
retrogametech Hope you made a recent markup on them?
retrogametech As usual, you managed to bag yourself a bargain!
retrogametech Thanks. Just luck :P. I still need to put a few hours work into each console to get them 100. Otherwise Im pretty happy :)
retrogametech I have a long video I can give you the link to about it if you are interested.
retrogametech Very well done mate, you have done it again!!
retrogametech Thanks, dude! They still need a bit of work but still a good deal. I see you have internet again? :)
retrogametech The problem I have with the whole scanline thing is they seem to always make the picture darker than it should be no matter what I put the intensity on.
retrogametech Router right next to the heater?
retrogametech Haha, Ive felt the same about the system for a while. The image quality always put me off. Totally love the console now, though. Games are dirt cheap and its extremely easy to softmod :)
retrogametech Well tell me too fuck off? Only asked a question... I was hoping he would reply not you...I have seen a lot of his videos but obviously not that one.. Chill out mate!
retrogametech Not sure about GC titles but mine is softmodded and plays games Wii games from any region (from an external HDD).
retrogametech Aw yeah Passing Breeze Euromix
retrogametech When I get into A more permanent location Id like to have A setup like that. Also makes me wanna get one of those for my Gamecube games  I wanna see what it would look like on the GameBoy Player And Shiren The Wanderer.
retrogametech beautiful, isnt it? :P
retrogametech your set up makes me want to touch myself in forbidden places.. like area 52..
retrogametech How much was the MV1C? You can buy good used ones for about US120150.
retrogametech game was closing in a shopping center next to me . My friend got about 20 ds games 1 2 pounds each .i missed out :C as i went the next day and it was fully closed
retrogametech Id love to do some vids on the weird games Ive found for the system :) . A GBA CIB collection? youve got balls! haha.
retrogametech Sure, Ill show them when I get round to doing my GBAGBC vids :)
retrogametech That wasnt WWF Mayhem it was WCW mayhem
retrogametech Thanks for watching :)
retrogametech Complete your first Neo Geo and keep the other one boxed up as a replacement
retrogametech so its just an xbox branded hd dvd player. Or is it have the hardware to play xbox games as well. Since xbox games are on hd dvd, correct?
retrogametech Those controllers arent Datel controllers, are they? Unless you got a WildfireTurbofire Evo, they may break soon. Judging from watching for about 5 secs and looking at a thumbnail, I may be wrong and if so just ignore me.
retrogametech Thanks. Anytime I pull my MVS boards out to work on I just end up playing them. Nothing ever gets done! :P
retrogametech Great effort you made, great job!
retrogametech great job saving the mega drive man, was a good watch! )
retrogametech Siik vid as always :)
retrogametech Talented fella ! .. Love your vids.
retrogametech they dont have a word for craftsmanship, do they?
retrogametech Thanks. Fixing stuff is fun :)
retrogametech Wow, youre lucky these boards were only double layered and didnt have any traces between the top and bottom sections otherwise that would be a dead board! Great work
retrogametech Great work my friend, your just like me bringing things back to life. Awesome repair 1010 keep the good work up I love watching your vids .
retrogametech I love your repair vids, they are so pleasant and interesting to watch!
retrogametech Brilliant mate. I love what you do :)
retrogametech Do you think that ds xl ones will fit well too? I have one that my son broke in pieces...
retrogametech clic clic clic clic clic clic clic clic clic clic clic clic how people can play whit these controller ? its a torture .
retrogametech Same as with the last controller. Id just find a faulty GBA SP and harvest those discs from its mobo :)
retrogametech Hell yeah! Fucking awsome bro...hope you get a high score useing this controller! You really did a fine job ! Peace and happy gameing
retrogametech they are fairly cheep and aslong as you have a wii it will work with that, its just made for compatability with wii u. anyways, i love your videos so i understand if you cant do it!
retrogametech Haha, thanks. I appreciate you watching. Id post more if I wasnt so lazy!
retrogametech yeah I love buying broken controllers and fixing them real fast
retrogametech Looks amazing and it was made in Scotland :) you can not get better than that
retrogametech Awesome artwork. Subbed.
retrogametech Download, print, cut, insert in box, done! :)
retrogametech Now that would be awesome! haha
retrogametech that is god damn cool. id like to do the same for apple jack.. my favourite xbox live game and one thats also quite retro..
retrogametech Its going to such when things go DL only :( .
retrogametech Just out of curiosity could you make a tutorial video of how you made this because I would like to make Pal blue box art for my copy of vectorman 2 so that it fits in my collection nicely :)
retrogametech HAHAHA. The number he put in upsidedown spells boobies
retrogametech Not all Dreamcasts came bundled with the modem. Some of the Asian SKUs didnt. Instead they had a detachable dummy modem in its place. Ive got a couple of those sitting in my cupboard somewhere. The Euro and American units all came with modems though I think.
retrogametech As he said its peer to peer, which means it doesnt need any outside service. For example if me and you wanted to play Cyberball online we would have to arrange a time to start then Id dial your home telephone number using the on screen phone in the game. It would then connect with your Megadrive (using typical modem sounds you used to hear on dialup) and wed start playing. It would just cost you the price of the call.
retrogametech dude u got one sick mega drive!!
retrogametech Wow I never knew the megadrive had its own modem that is pretty cool. Too bad its kinda useless nowadays. Still a pretty cool thing to have for collectors. I own the sega dreamcast and I cant even get it online cause all we have are ethernet cables. :(
retrogametech Thank you for bringing it to our attention! I would never have known about it otherwise.
retrogametech Awesome stuff, can you do a similar video on the Saturn modem?
retrogametech Way cool it still works! Cant say same thing with some of the newer discontinued online games.
retrogametech That is awesome thanks for sharing. I have a PAL Hong Kong system and on the back of the box there is a picture of the modem that was the first of me hearing of the device. This is the first video I have seen an it all makes sense the connections in the back even the screw hole lol. Great vid
retrogametech Where did you buy your NG multicart from? If you dont mind me asking.
retrogametech very cool. i needs me some CRT action.. hadnt thought about gettin a wee one, that could be easily stored away when not in use.. hmm... decisions decisions..
retrogametech When we gonna get to see a complete MVS consolized shell up and running.
retrogametech It usually depends on the console itself. For older consoles(Like the NES, SNES, MDG, and others) its probably only displaying at about 240i, with the only PALNTSC difference being that PAL consoles at the time ran at 50Hz, with NTSC at 60Hz. Although, for later consoles(Not sure when), PAL gets 576i, and NTSC gets 480i, with both displaying at about 60Hz. So, look up your consoles, and see what the resolution and Hz is. As for 25FPS Vs. 24, all it really does is create a problem in some DVDs
retrogametech Do you have the model number?
retrogametech So would you recommend me switching out my composite cable for an RGB? Im assuming you need an adapter to put the red, green and blue cables into so you can plug it into your SCART connection aye? Cheers for the help man.
retrogametech Its crazy that only a few years back people were paying a premium for these sets. Now you finds them for free or dirt cheap! :) CMVS update in the next few weeks hopefully :) . Not been buying much lately so no pickups to show :P
retrogametech PAL N64 (except for model NUS001(FRA) ) doesnt have an RGB output. Only composite. Its crap in terms of quality but still you can connect to any PAL TV. SCART connection (and cables) always carry composite video and stereo audio alongside optional svideo and RGB video.
retrogametech So mine hidden menu is I, 5 volume the tv button Now Areo Fighter fits perfectly. :D
retrogametech Do you think that scanline is the best option to play Dreamcast on a HDTV only for classic or arcade videogames? Or also for other videogames like Shenmue or Resident Evil Code Veronica?Im doubting whether buy a vga box with scanline or a vga scaler to HD for my currently vga box. Thanks
retrogametech RetroGameTech, all youre missing is the scaler and the syncstrike. Cheers!
retrogametech you might want to have a look at SLGinaBox and put a scart multiplicator on it.
retrogametech you might want to have a look at SLGinaBox and put a scart multiplicator on it. thats how i run my consoles on modern tv. its awesome. i also have to agree: rgb is the best you can get. on genesis, master system and saturn its no issue to get an rgb signal...sega ftw
retrogametech Retrogametech, just bought a dreamcast and loving every minute. It makes a fair noise when reading discs. I assume that if I opened it up and greased its cogs and lazer running track it might help, but what grease would you advise?
retrogametech I didnt think that 480p games would benefit from scanlines but it does provide a kind of fake antialiasing effect that works surprisingly well.
retrogametech I never thought anybody would want the lines on their TV, then again it does add that Nostalgic feeling.
retrogametech i have a bunch of xbox 360 video games
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech dont forget the pencil sharpner and coffee maker attachments complete with there own sega branded power supplies :D
retrogametech Now order pizza via GenesisMegaDrive
retrogametech Wow!! Ur megadrive looks like a beast with all those assesorys on it...awsome
retrogametech :D nice, is there anything the mega drive cannot do?
retrogametech awesome dude, greetings from NYC
retrogametech That would be really cool. I had no idea this even existed I knew about Sega Channel but this is the first time Ive ever seen this modem!
retrogametech there is a singularity and all sega products are sucked into the black hole left
retrogametech Hehe, whod have though, eh? :P
retrogametech DUDE YOURE DRIVING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD!
retrogametech not because of the roads, lol, because of the snow on the roads
retrogametech Oh, wow, that is beautiful. I could drive around there for hours, Im sure. I was uncomfortable throughout the video though, hahah, because in the back of my mind I was sure youd die at any moment. Im really not used to seeing things from that side of the road.
retrogametech ha should of seen the weather in mold flintshire wales that week
retrogametech Ahh good old Scotish weather, pretty much the same over here too LOL. Cool video matey :)
retrogametech Thats a lovely drive youve got there. Even in the US, we are getting crazy weather like that. Supposedly snowed somewhere here in Arkansas the other day.
retrogametech Movie maker can double a cars engine and handling performance )
retrogametech Cool vid. It looked you were diving in some of the corners Mansell ) What car were you driving may I ask?
retrogametech wow you must really no what your doing to try this lucky all three of my 3dss work fine wow good on you
retrogametech I got a metalic blue for chrismis (Forgot how to spell) And the whole thing inside was smashed and i just got it. Atleast i got a metalic red for a free refund.
retrogametech Thanks. Theyre great little consoles. You can pick them up reasonably cheap now :)
retrogametech It can be a bit of a gamble with the cosmetic condition of these systems but sometimes you get lucky and it pays off :)
retrogametech Well I kinda got lucky on this one I think :P . Normally they sell for a bit more.
retrogametech Buy some faulty old systems to mess around with and learn as you go :) . Most of what youll need to know can be found here on YouTube or on forums.
retrogametech Dat profile picture...
retrogametech In a Scottish accent: Thenks fuhr teking the tame to meking us these veedeohs
retrogametech The guy that sold this will be watching and saying you jammy fcking twt hehe
retrogametech You wouldnt happen to have an extra copy of Atari Masterpieces II would you? Its the only game left I dont have. Ive got some gold master review kits  orange beta cards if youre interested in trading for that kind of stuff.
retrogametech What is the 98 day countdown timer counting down to?
retrogametech That times, when phone was game console  its so damn priceless. Even NGage was screwed because of GBA and technical issues, its still looks more solid than whole IOS and Google Play Market.
retrogametech Same here, charged up the QD and started playing some of my old games :) . Dual MMC slot? That sounds interesting! Ive never seen one of those. It depends what type of games youre into but theres at least one good title in each genre.
retrogametech congrats on completing the collection! id love to see gameplay from xandu next and requim of hell
retrogametech Thanks. Ive not seen an NGage game in the wild for years!
retrogametech Can you still play these online?
retrogametech Thanks. Out of all the original Ngage games, only 55 were ever released as hardware copies that you could buy in stores. The rest were either download only or unreleasedunfinished betas. Thats why it might appear Im missing some titles. But the download only games can still be obtained and played if you search the internet ) .
retrogametech How much does an ngage roughly cost?
retrogametech any hints on how to fix thumbstick controller drift? my halo 4 controllers left stick is walking to the right, and my halo reach controller is pulling to the front too :(.
retrogametech I have this got for Christmas
retrogametech Awsome mod bro..keep up the great vids!
retrogametech any idears where i can get one of them dpads from ! Sooo Sick ! would be even better if i can get it in Red Chrome ! URGH
retrogametech Do you think you could make a video on modifying the PS3 controllers LEDs to change their color? Its probably fairly easy to do, but Id like to see you do it. Perhaps even adding an LED to the PS Button so it has like a glow effect to it. Just throwing ideas out. :)
retrogametech They are inside limited edition PAX controllers I believe.
retrogametech Yes, most of the stages are multiteared. I think a few of them have 3 tiers in various directionspaths. Its a very cool feature. Sadly I wasnt playing long enough to show them off here.
retrogametech Hey Martin, Ive been meaning to get a scanline generator, for the sake of 16bit games played through Dreamcasts early console emulation. I understand the need for scanlines for early games played on HD sets. But I see you recommending the scanline generator for the already high def DOA2... Does the use of scanlines in addition to VGA further enhance DOA2 beyond the HD image that VGA provides?
retrogametech Cool vid mate. Re the SLG 3000, can it take multiple inputs or only one at a time? Im interested in one but do not want the hassle of switching between consoles when using it. Thanks
retrogametech Ignore last question, I just looked at the info.
retrogametech I find it hard just to discern individual words let alone understand the language! It seems hella complicated. Would be very cool to be able to speak it though :) Who knows where the Dreamcast would have ended up had SEGA not had to call it quits. Its probably for the best though. They went out on a proper high. Better than crashing and burning in disgrace :)
retrogametech I think i have the Xbox DOA collection I think. I might have to dig it out and play it.
retrogametech The Dreamcast really was mind blowingly impressive when it came out. I couldnt believe how amazing the games looked at the time. Really ahead of its time.
retrogametech that was beautiful and very soothing
retrogametech I like to see other countries roads and stuff. I live in lower central Oklahoma US, its basically the same lol
retrogametech Fantastic video! Id love to visit the UK! And I LOVE that music, Ill have to checkout more of what Power Glove has to offer! Definitely had a retro 80s vibe to it, which I loved!
retrogametech Thanks, glad you liked it. I love driving at night, too. Very early morning is fun too. Zero traffic so you get the roads to yourself :)
retrogametech Cool video. Kind of reminded me of MSR on the Dreamcast.
retrogametech I have sensory overload just looking at it lol
retrogametech aw were u in hamilton if u work there a have a nice place u caan go for lunch i work there :)
retrogametech A 12 year old Ed trolling Game Gear owners? :P
retrogametech You can get the backlight on NonFinite! And also KitschBent or what ever its called!
retrogametech Your videos are very interesting to watch. I like to buy broken systems off ebay too. Recently bought i couple of PSPs, that ive fixed up (mostly cosmetic damage to housing etc), one of which I actually use myself. Keep your videos coming!
retrogametech Shame it doesnt appear big enough for a game gear screen
retrogametech Oldie but goodies! As love old fashioned stuff like this!
retrogametech hi do you do these for customers? i would like this done to my gameboy can you pm me? im in uk
retrogametech It adds a lot of functionality to the system. You can actually play it in the dark now! :) I wish Nintendo had shipped them like this.
retrogametech Congratulations man.. they look absolutely amazing with the backlit screens :) I imagine they look even nicer up close! Do they consume more juice now though?
retrogametech Now I want to play Super Mario. I guess its a small thing in terms of consumption, but do you have any idea about the impact of the backlit module over the battery life? You have a great channel, I am glad I stumbled upon it some months ago.
retrogametech Very nice looking unit! Specially when it is inside the controller and you cant see the two bright leds thru the case.
retrogametech Man that looks awsome..great job bro! :)
retrogametech Thanks Thomas! Yeah, I was really interested to see how it all went together. That video by engineerguy I linked to in the description is a good watch if youre interested :)
retrogametech you know, haters have no place in the retro world, retro is retro, rather it be sega or nintendo.
retrogametech Great stuff mate. I would love to do this with mine but I am not that great with electronics.
retrogametech No, you can only front light those. Youre only other option is to find an AGS101 SP.
retrogametech You should have put a switch on it to turn the light on and off. Otherwise, AWESOME!
retrogametech yeah some are truly bad, the Jag, Virtual Boy, few others, but I have to say growing up on NES, and just recently owning the Master System and getting more into Genesis now then I did before, I still love both pretty evenly
retrogametech I didnt know anyone who owned this system. Always heard about it.
retrogametech The game JJ and Jeff uses it ingame :)
retrogametech Im getting worried , they sell brand new ones like that for 75 pound on ebay are they faulty ?
retrogametech Id love to get some suggestions of games I should try.  the one you got is one of the best there is for the system. Id also recommend Keith Courage in Alpha Zones (platformer came bundled in some North American releases) and Victory Run (driving).
retrogametech Good job. Hey even if you couldnt get it working it would have been worth if for the box and the housing of that TG16
retrogametech Says no one else bid on it, says 4 bids.
retrogametech I did, I just have a habit of typing while watching is all.
retrogametech I think it was maybe a region mod gone wrong. Ill probably end up region modding it properly and also install a proper RGB output :)
retrogametech Have you ended up getting any more TG games?
retrogametech Those are almost exactly like my Trittons but with mine both of the adjustable plastic things on the side broke in half with in a year. Had to tape and screw them back together.
retrogametech Hey Martin! Nice pick ups. Subscribed to your channel not so long ago and was surprised to find out that youre a fan of DOA series. Yeah, same here and they are nice games. 1 for showcase of your entire DOA collection as someone mentioned here before. By the way whats your opinion on the latest game in the series? I personally find it pretty much ok game!
retrogametech Thanks for watchingcommenting! :)
retrogametech Totally agree. Cartridge games are just way cooler than disc based games. They look nicer stacked on a shelf, too. :)
retrogametech Hi Martin,im just curious whether you have studied electrical enigeering.Or did you pick up that knowledge over the internet?
retrogametech Been waiting for a pickup video :)
retrogametech i didnt know that ltered beast existed for the gba either! good find
retrogametech Lol, oh no!! Ill need to check it! It would be kinda funny if one of the few legit games I bought turned out to be fake!, haha. But that would explain the missing manual! Thanks for the suggestion dude. Ive actually been messing with the idea of some gameplaywaffle vids. I really enjoy watching other youtubers do them so could be fun to give it a try myself :) Cheers, Luke! goes off to check BK3 cart
retrogametech So you can reuse these? Sounds a lot like how the Gateway 3DS works now (you can only use one ROM per microSD card in the damn thing).
retrogametech Can you make one for 3DS? That would by TIGHT!
retrogametech That is awesome, you rock!!! Also the Gameboys you have are cool!!
retrogametech How do u do this for GBA? Can u do a tutorial on it?
retrogametech Haha, I think thats probably where I got it. Well spotted!
retrogametech Did you use zelda dx cart or another ? I only found the cart Magical TETRIS challenge it has MBC5 and 8KB RAM for file save. Can i flash pokemon rom and save because pokemon save require 32KB RAM. Where i live, there is not much original gb cart so its really a pain in my head to make this work .
retrogametech I also think this would be a good idea. like a gameboy everdrive of sorts
retrogametech can this happen for gameboy advance games as well?
retrogametech I really want to flash Earthbound to a Mother 2 cart. Do you think this is possible?
retrogametech Been fixing Gameboys for years and never knew about that thing with the screens, I figured they were just broken. Thanks for that!
retrogametech Nice tip for repairing missing pixel rows, hadnt thought to try that.Ive fixed a game cartridge with faulty mask ROM before. Seems the issue was that some of the bonding wires inside the IC package were loose from the chip. Squeezing the ROM chip hard seemed to make it work for a moment, so I did a permanent fix by wedging a wad of paper between the IC and the top of the cartridge shell.
retrogametech You are a wizard ! Where did you study ?
retrogametech Looks like new. I just turned two broken DC into one fully working one. Now I have parts for a JP dreamcast I may put on eBay. Main board and GD Rom board. May paint the shell for fun.
retrogametech pretty common knowledge with engineers and hobbyists. :)
retrogametech Thats what I hope every time I buy something to fix :)
retrogametech Ive seen modded ones go for 150 Therefore yes there is a pretty penny to be made )
retrogametech tri wing screwdriver (to open up the console)  a soldering iron (to go across the ribbon cable points below the screen).. He makes it quite clear in the video, lol )
retrogametech thank you for showing me how to repair these! your work has inspired me to want to go buy a box of non working gameboys off ebay and see how many working ones I can build.
retrogametech Being Scottish I absolutely loved this :D and also being a big fan of Martin, also to the guy below me it is pronounced iron brew but it is spelt in Scottish slang.
retrogametech I knew there was something edible!
retrogametech thanks a lot man, Ill be giving it a shot soon!
retrogametech Santa Clause Jr. LOL.
retrogametech indeed, indeed. really cool to have gotten this.
retrogametech I am living in Singapore ang mo kio ave 10 street 44 block 467 level 8 08 1010
retrogametech haha quality! send him sum square sausage and tottie scones next retro game tech. lol
retrogametech irn bru. im not scottish but i love it!
retrogametech Is Scottish tablet what they have instead of iPads in Scotland?
retrogametech gives new meaning to fappy hours doesnt it? whats next, facial recognition to see if you look old enough to do adult things? crazy!
retrogametech 11pm is just taking the piss. Seems they are locked to the German watershed times. Apparently they have two watersheds one at 22:00 for content suitable for 16 and up and then 23:00 for 18 content. Youd think they would implement a system which at least sticks to the watershed for each respective country...
retrogametech it is a cheek if they have parental control, its no different than a kid goign on the internet, it should be up to the parents
retrogametech personally i dont own a 3DS but a friend does and i think that its BS and is silly because most kids stay up late anyways these days also it wouldnt be hard to take some thing as small as a DS into bed with you. There is a way around it i help the afore mentioned friend with it by side jacking via LAN into the 3DS you can intercept the packets in a man in the middle style attack and edit the time that the DS recieves but cmon its a DS we shouldnt need to hack it to play legit content we buy
retrogametech I totally agree. This kind of stuff just makes me less interested in the WiiU or browsingbuying anything the eShop. Sony already lost my custom because they insisted I spend 20min downloading and installing either a dashboard update or massive game patch every time I switched the freakin PS3 on. Its just not worth the bother! Retro FTW!
retrogametech When I read the article about this, I felt bad Europe gamers, I think the problem is because Nintendo doesnt really have accounts that you log into the console with, instead you log into your account with the console, if they fix this problem you can have your Mii on your 3DS, then jump on your Wii U or Wii, and only adult players will be allowed to buy things or watch restricted content. But sadly, I fear that wont happen with this generation of consoles... :(
retrogametech Thanks Ashens friend for the reassurance:D. I didnt even know you watched these videos Larry, I really like your videos and think your very cool. Have a nice day!
retrogametech I prefer classification over censorship, and these kinds of decisions are why Nintendo will be so far behind the online aspect of console gaming and why I cant justify buying the WiiU.
retrogametech this is bullshit! whats the difference between watching a trailer on a 3ds and watching it on youtube? you can watch the trainler without any restrictions on the internet so why the 3ds?
retrogametech I love Turok!!! I have it for the first Xbox.
retrogametech Did not know about the whole ags thing, look at the back of my sp, ags 001  But, it is the tribal sp, which i see is one of the limited edition ones, which i didnt know previously, despite having it for nigh 9 years
retrogametech The last time I played Turok was on the 64...
retrogametech that bruce lee game is ace just for the sound effects lol. looks a great game. love mirrors edge.. fingers crossed for a sequel.
retrogametech Could I buy one of them AGS101s?
retrogametech Its a great handheld the gba sp and that Yurok game is a gem of a game, I have that myself found it in a bargin bin with 11 more gba games all for 2.50! Have you still got that desert eagle dreamcast light gun? Could you do a video of it in action please, i have seen you video when you first had it and its so cool.
retrogametech The european code onthe blue GBA is a German Zip Code ... Its a german GBA
retrogametech PLease can you do a tutorial showing how to do the language and 5060hz switch mod.. also overclocking one would be great too..Although i heard you dont need one of those 10mhz crystals.. you can hack into one of the cart socket traces or something.. cheers anyway
retrogametech Hi can u tell me what audio jack u used and possibly a tutorial on the audio jack thanks love your megadrive
retrogametech Does this work with a Sega Genesis to make it 50hz?
retrogametech I wished I lived in the UK. I love the way the Megadrives look with the white ring section on the front of it. I am thinking of buying a broken megadrive and swapping the insides for a american genesis internals.
retrogametech Awesome video as ever Martin. I dig the High Definition Graphics Model 1 :) I was looking for one of those when I picked up my Model 1 earlier this year but couldnt find one. They are getting harder to pick up.
retrogametech So will you be selling that modded mega drive? If so I would be interested )
retrogametech I got mine on ebay for about 2.50 I think.
retrogametech this made my birthday a good one:D
retrogametech Thanks dude. The overclock mod isnt really needed but it is fun to mess about with. Youre not missing much :P . The 5060Hz mod on the other hand is essential IMO. Such a big difference! :)
retrogametech HAHA, yeah normally I see it like that, but I have had that particular Atari since 1979 :P
retrogametech Amazing project, I really cant wait to see the update...
retrogametech I keep forgetting the part about older systems not being HD, which is where the confusion came from, lol.
retrogametech Thanks! No doubt Ill need it! :P
retrogametech Good project! SCARTRGB is the perfect choice for television. But can you add also a VGA output?
retrogametech Hi just wanted to know how you connected jamma to scart Do tv s in the UK accept 15khz
retrogametech Im sure it is, but the thing about SCART is that (from what i know) it isnt HD, so they probably do use Component and HDMI a lot, but then again im not too sure. Given that an MVS isnt a modern HD arcade board, SCART is probably a lot better than Composite or SVideo. Plus most TVs should have SCART inputs in Europe.
retrogametech Great video. Just started one of these myself, would be great to see an update when you get time )
retrogametech Large rubber feet make every project classy.
retrogametech Thanks for such a good video showing how easy it would be to repairreplace.
retrogametech The Saturn is actually very similar in design. Maybe in future I do the same for the Saturn. It sounds like you either have a bad cable or just need to resolder the the AV port to the motherboard.
retrogametech What exactly are you referring to?
retrogametech If thats the case then Im slightly worried about what exactly you were expecting to see me do. :P
retrogametech GDROM? did you mean cdrom?
retrogametech I believe you can make and use substances like Retr0bright to restore old systems. But Its not something Ive ever tried myself.
retrogametech i reckon you can shave 2 mins off it if you had to.maybe youll start console stripping speedrun craze lol
retrogametech Seeing a Dreamcast thats old enough for a retrobrite treatment makes me feel well old
retrogametech Lol, I appreciate it dude! Youre usually one of the first people to watchcomment on my vids. Thanks for the support! :)
retrogametech your videos are good you need to make money off them
retrogametech Id actually thought of it but those wireless padsreceivers are so rarevaluable that it would be a real shame to hack them. Im still looking into doing it with a cheap 3rd party adapter though :)
retrogametech I have the wireless mega drive controllers. They work amazingly well. I ended up opening mine up and sticking a couple of 2p pieces in each of the grips of the controller to add a bit of weight.
retrogametech Thanks! The new cover seems to work pretty well :)
retrogametech Thanks Luke! It was kinda crazy after you posted up that reply, haha. I appreciate you taking the time to do that!
retrogametech The Sega Classics collection should be on Xbox Arcade.
retrogametech Space Harrier is good :) liked it
retrogametech Worked better than I expected! Ghetto solutions FTW! :)
retrogametech what type of desoldering paste is acceptable
retrogametech Do more of these please.
retrogametech I have a problem. My nin dsi xl wont read my pokemon heart gold what do I do?
retrogametech Wish i could solder like that, i always screw it up. Hell, i killed 2 xboxs trying to get a modchip in. I gave up and found a 1.5 on the ebay and got that.
retrogametech Thank you!, glad you enjoyed it :)
retrogametech love your videos sorry for the wd40 cartridge comment
retrogametech nice vid...... lol you are like me .... Fixing stuff all the time... btw the tip looked a bit big for the job :D
retrogametech Your post made me laugh really hard, you have a good point
retrogametech epic :D btw your subbed and liked
retrogametech That room looks like one hell of a playground (a good thing), Luke. I love these gaming set up vids and hope you dont mind but I made a real quick vid response of my own set up. Its nothing grand but something I wanted to do for some time.
retrogametech im the same i like to switch systems also and always come back to the retro 1s :)
retrogametech Megaman Anniversary Collection! Awesome!
retrogametech Wow awesome! Now to play some lunar magic school.
retrogametech Just wached retrogametechs video and now this popped up in my sub box thanks luke :D
retrogametech You could do a series of progress vids as you start to set it all up!
retrogametech Thanks dude! Yeah I cant keep anything stock. Ive always got to take things apart, find out how they work, and, most importantly, install blue LEDs :) Btw, you going to be doing your QA responses after youre done moving?
retrogametech Thanks! I got into console modding back in the Xbox 1 days. Before that I way always just taking stuff apart to see how it worked etc. Mostly just self taught, trial and error, internet tutorials etc etc. Region modding the Dreamcast involves some tricky soldering to mount a new BIOS chip onto the old one and lift a few chip legs etc. It really depends on how confident you are with a soldering iron.
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech I love your channel especially your ebay junk videos
retrogametech Got my CMVS project on the way P
retrogametech PS . id buy that xbox if u ever wanna sell i want that xbox so bad hahahaha
retrogametech Thanks Ed. I considered wrapping the broomstick in black electrical tape but Im too lazy even for that :P.
retrogametech R4is are Fake in the sense that it wasnt made by the original R4 team. So ALL the R4is you see are fake. Though the really early R4s you have in your pile might be real, but you would have to really look at them hard and perhaps have a real one on hand to spot them as fake or not.
retrogametech Yeah, its very similar to that. And yes you could quite easily add a 3.5mm audio jack if you wanted. Ill be doing a similar mod to another mk1 Mega Drive in the next few months. Ill can maybe try and film it.
retrogametech Ah, I see. But its a lot of work and expense to do something like that. Youd need to buy all the various connectors and components and the price would really add up. Its also quite a fiddly job so youre talking several hours to complete. Im not sure the payoff would be worth it when you consider all the extra cables everywhere and that a single dedicated cable can be found for much less. I can see how it would be a fun Xbox project but personally I wouldnt have any reason to do it on mine.
retrogametech Nintendo have allegedly made r4 unuseable on 3ds.
retrogametech A couple of times every hour or so. You have to be quick! :)
retrogametech Thats a big no no sorry. That would be me outright selling pirated games!
retrogametech Sadly most of them have hardware faults.
retrogametech Wanna sell me some? :D
retrogametech I originally bought an M3. It works crazy well.
retrogametech Sonic Adventure 7 returns......
retrogametech PopStations sure have come a long way graphically. Shame about the sounds.
retrogametech i have one of these but the games printed on the cartage are poorly printed
retrogametech I would want one. Mostly to say I have it. Only so many do.
retrogametech I have the exact same cartridge. :) watch?vubX0a8Ngct3m40s
retrogametech Now I know who bidded over me. D:
retrogametech Any link (or at least the chinese name of the cartridge) to buy it on taobao or other ? Great video, loves these chinese hacked games.
retrogametech Cheers for the mental image. Any particular reason for multi coloured chalk? Sadly the cameras mic doesnt do it justice. In real life the frequencies being produced make it almost unbearable to be in the same room. For real!
retrogametech Suddenly the ugliest man in Glasgow wasnt good enough for her!
retrogametech 9:01 Flashcard detected
retrogametech I cant understand how people always seem to get juice INSIDE the cart slot! Ive seen so many systems like this. How are you spilling juice inside your console?! lol Maybe kids sabotaging their older systems to persuade parents to buy the latest model? Who knows shrugs.
retrogametech Double Dragon Music :)
retrogametech 7:00 i hear double dragon!! I play super double dragon on my snes so often its one of my favorite games lol
retrogametech Maybe next one I do. Its a pretty tricky thing to film :P
retrogametech i will download it ! but last nite i broke my hand left hand! so is impoosable to play games! its hell for me not to be able to play games!!! :)
retrogametech Background Music Bring Back That Catchy Tune You Used To Use!! Always Interesting Man!! Theres Not Enough Hours In The Day. I Wish I Could Fix Stuff Like That.
retrogametech LOL! No it wasnt, but maybe, after all, there is such a thing as an innuentendo.
retrogametech Ill try and do a vid on that when I get some spare time. Ive not used it much yet so cant really give a good opinion on it.
retrogametech when you split the for the wires I assume it was parallel, does the amperage drop or did you use any resistors inline... I want to do this with one of my old dell power cords but the output is 19V I was going to add a resistor to drop the volts down to 9 but I dont what to fry anything with the amps.
retrogametech nice class idea man great vids :)
retrogametech I have a gba sp that i stepped on, the system still works but half the screen is black,.. is it an easy fix and cheap or should i just buy another one?
retrogametech Thanks, Thomas. It all seems to be running fine :) . Ideally Id like to get it looking a bit tidier. Maybe use a small hobby box as a junction box to better hide the connections or something. Really appreciate all your input and help btw!
retrogametech that looks difficult, aha
retrogametech Whats that xbox lcd th ing
retrogametech I uploaded a vid about the MVS projects just before this one :) . Maybe not fully published yet.
retrogametech nice trick I have 4 power strips for all my stuff and its still need more most of that is because of all the big DC plugs
retrogametech I have a big box of random wires and adapters from lots of faulty electronics Ive scavenged over the years :) . I totally recommend doing it! Its freed up so much space!! You just need to double check the polarity of all your plugs and consoles. I found that most of mine were different.
retrogametech Man ,you genius! i have in mind the same kind of idea!
retrogametech I want one in a cabinet!!!
retrogametech just put it in an old bubblejet printer case. it should fit.
retrogametech yeah ill pm you a link for the one i use. i gotta dig through my purchase history to find the product number and everything. ill send you a link and the product  as soon as i find it. its a pretty small psu so i think youll like it.
retrogametech i cant wait to see the finished product!
retrogametech btw love your vids. wish i could do this
retrogametech Another interesting mod that a few people have done to the MV1B, is to remove the cartridge slot PCB, and reconnect it so that it is back to back with the mainboard. This makes for a very tiny NeoGeo MVS that can be put in a small housing with a vertical cart slot.
retrogametech Can i buy it from you? Please?
retrogametech its because he has the rare backlit model
retrogametech and i downloaded the ROM and it worked fine
retrogametech oh nothing...just due to the fact that people would spend 45 for a flashcart...that plays ...homebrew...I wasnt implying anything about you mate, but for everyone else :P
retrogametech Wow! Looks like a real winner to me....
retrogametech I have this game, I remember my brother telling me my grandfather found it from a seller in the Philipines. I still have it to this day.
retrogametech Yes I hate them, but so long as I dont have to play them I still find it interesting. Who knows, this could be better than any of SEGAs attempts lately.
retrogametech Cool Beans, I love Rom Hacks and Fan made games, even though they are rarely good, I have a Mario Bros. that has Final Fantasy sprites which is pretty good.
retrogametech Download permission denied by uploader. (0b67c2f5)
retrogametech Thats the only downside to these things, the wire is a kinda annoying. But theyre massive and really comfy. The earpieces are so big they fit around my ears and rest on my head.
retrogametech Hey.. I have a pair and hte only problem is the sound quality has dropped and the bass is crackly and im not sure what is wrong. i think its because my friend had them up way to loud and did something to the speakers HELP :(
retrogametech you could do me a massive favour by showing me how to fix a wired xbox 360 controller, my cable is faulty, thanks!
retrogametech gross, used headphone?
retrogametech Dont replace the chip, just stick a small signal relay to turn off the 6V when it powers down, normally open etc.
retrogametech Thanks! :) That explains a lot. So it looks like theres maybe an issue with the RAM or video output?
retrogametech Lol, Oi! Im not giving up on the other board :P. Its actually in much better condition than this new one, so if I can, Ill use the donor to try and diagnose the fault on the original board. Trying to get these systems working again has at times been frustrating as hell! So many occasions Ive been tempted to rage quit and throw them out the window! haha I just want to play me some Metal Slug!!!!
retrogametech Excellent progress. Im sure after bit more resoldering pins etc youll get it fired up. Could be just cold solder joints.
retrogametech ITS ALIVE! Lightning flashes, thunder booms, electrical gzzzzzk noises
retrogametech I thought you were getting nothing until I recognised COOK!KEEQIOG which is obviously meant to be BOOK KEEPING, and it unravelled from there: it is indeed saying work ram error. The diagnostic BIOS will tell you straight away whether the ramCPU is busted, but it may be that the character ROM (stored in the GPU) is missing or corrupted. As far as I remember, this can be recopied by running an official game cart from your region just once, which leaves a lot of users sol
retrogametech How long would these batteries last?
retrogametech thanks man! really big help! keep up the awsome vids! Could u do a video showing how to replace the housing on a original ds? i have one from china that i got when i was a kid and my cousin broke both screens and tore up the case.
retrogametech Just wondering how long the life on the button batteries is? Thanks for the budgetspeed mod Man! Keep up the great work :)
retrogametech Ive seen people mod these with AA batteries, but mostly for console carts to hide it better
retrogametech will the CR1220 Battery and Cell work For Pokemon Yellow since It uses A CR1616 Battery? ps. I bought 5x Cr2025 holders off ebay, so when a battery goes flat I dont need to solder. Also I looks good. To bad GameFreak and nintendo didnt think of it.
retrogametech I never would have thought of this, good work, man! Now I just need to find smaller ones to fit inside standard gameboy games and Im golden!
retrogametech I actually ordered a lot of a 100 cr2032 battery holders and replaced all my batteries in my NES games and put in the battery holders. Im eventually going to replace all my SNES, SMS and Genesis batteries and install battery holders.
retrogametech Pokemon Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire all have the internal batteries. Leafgreen and Firered dont have a battery, therefore firered and leafgreen will always save.
retrogametech this xbox looks sick, i wish the xbox one looked half has cool as the OG
retrogametech YOU WERE PLAYING METALLICA IN THE BACKGROUND!!! FUCK YEAH
retrogametech Omg black Dreamcast. So cool.
retrogametech Cool Mod. I recently got a modded XBOX with installed XECUTER 2.6 Modchip and secondary Hard Drive on Amazon for 40. Fun Fact: It came with a fresh installed build of XBMC 1.1 from April 2005 or so. The seller didnt even know the console was modded, so I think it was a good deal. I love to use my XBOX as a media center. :3
retrogametech excellent.. still got my modified xbox with executer 2.6 (nonsolder chip) with 80gb hard drive networked upto 2 pcs :) , still love the original xbox.. had a few modified ones over the years.
retrogametech where can i buy an xecuter 2.6 or 3? or an xbox like this!
retrogametech Hey dude! Hows things? Yep Ive seen them sell for close to 200. And I regularly get some crazy offers to sell that black one I modded. Got the shelving unit for a tenner at Home Bargains! :)
retrogametech is that a dreamcast in your pic
retrogametech Ive had people call me Irish. Scotland  Ireland.
retrogametech the old battery was a rechargeable one 50mAH, I dont think its a good idea to replace it with a nonrechargeable lithium battery because it will explode when recharged.
retrogametech Good to hear. I thought there was a possibility you might have (wasnt sure). Hence my phrasing.
retrogametech If chips get hot like that, theyve usually shorted out inside. What happens after that can be completely random depending on how the chip died and whats shorted out in it. Try removing the Yamaha chip (its the actual sound chip so beyond making sound it shouldnt be doing anything important) and see what happens. If youre lucky you might get an error telling you the sound chip is missing or bad.
retrogametech You can take a Z80 out of a dead Model 1 Mega DriveGenesis or even an old Master System. Ive seen a bunch of them Z80s die for no reason. Whats the voltage on pin 57 (SCS) of the YM2610 when the systems running? If its somewhere between 2 and 4 volts, the Z80 is accessing it properly. Is the voltage on pins 19, 28, and 62 5 volts? if not it may be shorted out.
retrogametech i have a question if you ever find a sega cd 1 pal could i pleas buy it?
retrogametech If Robot Chicken hasnt done anything with these things, they should. XDIm pretty sure Nintendo had a line of these as well, available around the same time.
retrogametech So when are you going to repair it?
retrogametech Those are so fing cool! Man id end up spending retarded amounts of money on those hahaha.
retrogametech When I get these for my Action Man, he is gonna FREAK.
retrogametech can I borrow your shrink ray? :p
retrogametech I just ordered a NeoGeo from ebay, but it didnt come with a cartridge and I know they exist. I just have to figure out what kind of ebay search will pull these things up.
retrogametech This is the greatest nerdgasm Ive ever experienced...
retrogametech Oh yeah!!!!! Just AWESOME!!!!!! Just imagine if I could just make some money off people buying scale models of the bikes I ride from vending machine sales.
retrogametech I use to work with plastic injection mold machines. Can you imagine how long it took to tool that mold for those miniature models.Cool, Thanks.
retrogametech I got all the power wiring done after making this vid. Just got video and sound to do next. Taking my time and double checking everything as I go. So many unknownuntested variables to consider with something like this. But it is kinda fun! :) I really want to play those games on that cart now! I got the cart on eBay (what a surprise eh?). It was more or less the same price as a single sports game.
retrogametech Would love to see how the traces get repaired.
retrogametech It depends on how many and what games are on the cart. From what Ive seen they typically go for between 2080.
retrogametech Cool stuff man. Luke is a solid guy and takes the time to help out. Another good vid man:)
retrogametech Thanks for the tips. Ive got it drip drying right now.
retrogametech 1:07 did you just read my mind lol? I was like I wonder what that is in dollars?
retrogametech Keep make videos lots and lots
retrogametech I know a lot of people who are huge fans of the SMS and want those 3D glasses, but not the price would love this! I am going to tell them about it, great stuff man.
retrogametech Tell me about it. I can see the 3D effect from here! (Just a little jokey poos there)
retrogametech Cool. I probably would never have gotten to try out the Master Systems 3D if it wasnt for these cheap glasses XD
retrogametech very nice light fix on the ngage sign i like your videos did you have to take the whole thing apart i guess that it was a project for you to do
retrogametech Haha, I think peeps might start to think I was a little egotistical if I did something like that :P
retrogametech Great vid. Did you get the Duke Nuke Em cover out...?
retrogametech Looks great, well done.
retrogametech Sweet, Ill need to check that out. Ive mostly just been messing around with GBA roms so far.
retrogametech The only question I have with this is can you play online with friends in games such as pokemon? Thanks!
retrogametech dang... i wish you were my father, haha!
retrogametech Nice! Only problem is Im having a very hard time finding one to buy online. Ebay included. No one seems to have them. Where could I buy one today?
retrogametech does that software work on mac os x? Or only windows eh?
retrogametech You made me download Klonoa
retrogametech Where the heck did you find this?
retrogametech I live in the USA, is there any place online I can buy one of these? And Do they play all GBA games including Japanese Imports?
GameSack Super cool. Ill be living in Texas by then and Im planning on attending Retropalooza as well. Hope to see you guys there.
GameSack I cant wait to go to my first convention.. someday..
GameSack What were you guys laughing at just before this video started?
GameSack Dave you fucking suck dick holes. Go fuck your self and lick game sac. Asshole.
GameSack Out of everyone you guys listed.... Your the only ones I would want to talk too. Well that and Pat he seems like he would be cool to check out the flea market with (one of my favorite hobbies.) I wish I could go, maybe next year. Unless there is some sort of cool convention in FL then I would drive :)  Anyway I love your videos and please keep making them forever! better than whats on TVCable by leaps and bounds.
GameSack Dont forget to bring your life jackets
GameSack I wish Columbus Ohio had something like gaming conventions. Most we have is Ohayocon
GameSack Cool episode!:D Am I the only one that Twinkle Star Spritess mechanic and gameplay reminds of Touhou 3 Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream for the PC98?
GameSack Well, I have a Neo Geo, but I have never come across a Neo Geo CD...
GameSack youve proven to me that you have more money than sense. lol, man.. how many people do we know that are exactly like that?great episode again.this show is so choice, I swear 3
GameSack Awesome as usual, Ive got a CDZ without a PSU (which im just getting around to sorting out), looks like a nice system.
GameSack Review kid chameleon for Sega gen
GameSack Even though the cd is cheaper, is funny that the music is better in some games.
GameSack Awesome. I love these Neo Geo episodes. Keep up the great work guys!
GameSack You guys have the best shirts. Always look forward to see what you guys wear for the review. Thanks for all that you guys do.
GameSack You guys still impress me with youre high quality production YouTube videos. I didnt know there was a Neo Geo CD console. Keep up the good work.
GameSack Mr. Dave, you were right, sweet game, and imo a sweet shirt. Shirtwin is a tie, that Night Trap shirt is pretty awesome too :) I cant believe that Neo Geo cartridges were so damn expensive, thats unreal. I knew they were expensive, but damn. Metal Slug is the greatest run n gun series in history dammit. I love the SNK stuff, its almost all arcade game goodness, which I love. Any plans on doing more arcade game episodes? Great job as always guys, thanks for the goodness, and damn those after credit bits are entertaining :)
GameSack Dave and Joe both wearing Sega shirts... what is this world coming to?
GameSack That slap at the end sounded like it hurt
GameSack Another obscure system  another great episode! A bit fighter heavy, but hey, Neo Geo  what can you do? :)Ive picked up several of the Neo Geo compilations and Dreamcast ports released over the years, but I still have many Neo Geo games on my wish list. I figure either the CD or consolized MVS is my best option if I ever decide to go with original hardware.Had never seen Twinkle Star Sprites before  looks like an amazing puzzleshooter hybrid. Thanks for the recommendation, Dave!
GameSack Love the stopmotion effects. You guys are awesome! Please keep bringing us these interesting looks into past consoles!
GameSack Funny video, was laughing the whole time. Can you upload more videos like this?
GameSack Almost 50k subscribers, and very well deserved. Congratulations gentlemen!
GameSack I remember playing that Lupin the 3rd game when I was a kid. It must have been a bootleg copy.
GameSack The main character in the Agedama game looks kind of like Keith Courage. In fact, this game could probably be the sequel that the credits talked about!
GameSack These make me jealous sometimes that Japan gets so many inventive titles that dont make it out to the states. We never get to see bugs pissing rivers!Also, but kind of unrelated, doing some video reviews has revealed some interesting things about narration, like the importance of carefully pronouncing certain phrases like game mechanics (I bet you guys know what I mean!)...What do you guys think of my Legaia 2 review?Experiential Game Reviews: Legaia 2: Duel Saga
GameSack Favorite video game reviewers on youtube! Thanks guys.
GameSack Great left in Japan games...Phantasy Star (Mega Drive convert... just for the nostalgia)Thunder Force V (Saturn)Strider (Mega Drive version they cut the huh with the sword strike and ALL SONS OF OLD GODS... DIE!!!!)Perhaps and episode that highlights the differences between US and Japanese versions of great games. Some of the changes make NO sense to me.
GameSack Hey, I cared about the Sports episode, I enjoy every episode! I actually hope you guys make a 2nd sports one someday. Anyway, great episode, I really liked that outro bit, that one may have been one of my favorites so far.
GameSack Yu yu hakusho final only n japan 4 super famicom js
GameSack You forgot every single other game that you didnt mention here. Im telling my mommy on you.
GameSack I havent missed a bungie beta yet and my code I think I sent it to a wrong email cause I dont see any notification or email that I will be able to play the beta Im kinda losing my shit
GameSack how do you strip the ball?
GameSack Jamie collins was a qb converted to lb
GameSack Ugh. US SNES is ugly. My PS1 would only bang EU or JP one.
GameSack That... might be the weirdest thing I have ever seen. Um... um... yeah....
GameSack This actually made me laugh pretty hardLove you two!
GameSack Is it weird that it turns me on?
GameSack Nice top logo with Soldier Blade! WORD!
GameSack i feel like a psone joke was missing.
GameSack The n64 looks like a roomba
GameSack Um, I think you confused love for lust.
GameSack 1:50 Heyy! Didnt know that the MajesticSix from Crysis 2 and 3 was in this game! Seems all big revolvers look the same these days...
GameSack you know what game IS MUCH MORE fun than vandal hearts? front mission 3...
GameSack NO resident evil? pssh.
GameSack On RIDGE RACER and RR REVOLUTION, you will UNLOCK the extra cars with a PERFECT score on the Galaxian or Galaga 88 intros!RIDGE RACER REVOLUTION allows you to race on ALL tracks from both Rigde Racer and the RR Revolution in the SYSTEM LINK mode! R4 is the only other Ridge Racer game with a system link. Linked racing is sweet and cheap to make happen on the PSX these days. 2 PSXs with link cable (10 online) and 2 SD Tubes!
GameSack The playstation was definitely much better as a 2D console. I missed out on a lot good games by going the Nintendo 64 route. I dont regret it though.
GameSack good list of games and I would for sure love to try silent hill on PS1 cause I own one myself
GameSack playstation easily has the best controllers.
GameSack Thumbs up if you agree the PS1 is better than the N64!
GameSack The PS1 was cool in its time, but I just cant bring myself to go back and play that generation of games. 8 and 16 bit I still play from time to time, but the 32 bit games suffered hard from that awkward shift from 2d to 3d where they just didnt have things figured out yet, and the controls, and other game play mechanics suffered because of it.
GameSack Tobal 1 was a very fun fighting game. The characters were designed by Akira Toriyama. Plus a Final Fantasy 7 Sample disc was included.
GameSack You forgot gex the gecko. Gex was orginially a mascot for the company crystal dynamics. Sadly though crystal dynamics only shits out tomb raider nowadays.
GameSack BUBSY!!!! BUBSY!!!!I like your Snatcher shirt btw
GameSack PUNKY IS ADORABLE YOU CURR!!!
GameSack Vector mans design was just a placeholder at first but then they decided that they liked him or something of that such.
GameSack Biggest mascot miss was definitely Crash and Spyro. Even now I could feel them being pushed in my face. Ugh. I will never forget those horrible Crash commercials.
GameSack Id say abe from oddworld
GameSack I love gamesack! I just recently discovered your channel and its a gem that fills me with nostalgia and has a charm to it like no other. You guys are great, I hope you continue with gamesack for many years to come.
GameSack I miss Sparkster from Rocket Knight Adventures, Dynamite Headdy and Ristar...I loved those games. Great video, as always.
GameSack I had to turn the video off due to stupidity. :( Vectorman has lots of variety and exploration, maybe learn to play video games? I did this when I was 7 years old!
GameSack That was great. I always wondered what we sound like in another language. Thank You!
GameSack someone key me in on wtf is up with the gaiares cover they showed. I looked up the box and its... not that guy lol. but i saw ads with him, but no explanation.
GameSack I would have put Sonic The Hedgehog after SMW.
GameSack On super castlevania 4, at 20:26ish, the guy with the purple robe looks exactly like the guy on altered beast!?
GameSack The actual video starts at 2:57 people, seams like every time I come across your videos, the intro gets longer! WTF?!
GameSack Joe  Dave be sure to party hard!! You guys are the best! The amount of work you put into your clips is astonishing! Keep it up! And never give up! Ill be here to help you up  Youve just been GAMESACKED, BITCH! YOU CATCH MY DRIFT!Edit: Holy crap was I shitfaced. oO, still, you guys rock! :D
GameSack I liked Dave list it had all the best games. I was so so on Joes list, but they were solid choices. Oh yeah Happy 100th Episode. I also want to say thanks for having your channel. I have a Super NES and Sega Genesis, but I was trying to figure out what games to buy for them. Thanks to all your suggestion, my collection is coming along nicely. PS: Thanks for introducing me to the Sharp X68000, I love Etoile Princesse.
GameSack Super Metroid is my number one 16bit game.
GameSack Isnt that the bad guy from Altered Beast in Super Castlevania 4? he is on the hallway where the torches light up
GameSack I really think you guys keep getting better and better! I cannot wait for the next 100!
GameSack ranma yes best fighter ever lol.
GameSack Other 16 bit fighting games to take a look at: Power Moves. It was a bizarre fighting game that features some, at times, pretty phoneomal animation. Its really interesting mostly because of the way its set up. Its interesting to see a fighting game that is trying hard not to copy SF2 or MK, for better or worse.
GameSack WATCH THE SHOW AND YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND THE STORY!!!
GameSack We played Eternal Champions a lot.Then I got the Sega CD version which was even cooler.
GameSack Great job. You forgot to mention that eternal champions had zero combos
GameSack If there is a next time? who knows? Mmm is this potentially the last ever episode then?
GameSack Ive seen Game Sack almost always rag on graphics, especially early 3d ones, but in my opinion graphics are only bad if they hinder your playing experience.
GameSack some SNK boss Syndrome, you guys outta talk about that one day
GameSack Another great video guys. Thanks!
GameSack 1:30, you can see his balls...
GameSack Guys great channel just found you and subed
GameSack GAME SACK play BIO MECHANICAL TOY. ITS AMAZING AND WAS ONLY RELEASED IN SPAIN.
GameSack Guys, if you plan to do a fourth one of these then please add Tumblepop, it was only ever released on the original gameboy
GameSack You should mention which beatemups have 4player mode. It may not matter to you, but it does to me and probably other people. Thats the main reason I own boards for Hook, Mystic Warriors, Bucky OHare, and every other 4player board Ive been able to find.For your next Left in the Arcades you should do Karate Blazers from Video System. Thats a funny and interesting beatemup.
GameSack Why didnt B Rap Boys get ported to American home consoles? Probably punching lions and a black kid flying around throwing watermelons at you had something to do with it. :
GameSack My nominations for a 4th video: the conspicuous absences of Segas arcade racers  Indy 500, Super GT  Scud Race, Daytona 2...
GameSack Golden Axe: Revenge of Death Adder!
GameSack MORE... MORE... MOOOOOREEE...
GameSack S.P.Y (Special Project Y) made by Konami in 1989, Crime Fighters made by Konami in 1989,  Sly Spy made by Data East in 1989.
GameSack good info, nice humor, excellent reviews
GameSack im not a morning person at all either, as seen by my username )
GameSack i know how you feel about csr.i hate it..once you get to certain level it matches u up against clans and shit..i love competative but i like casual too..i wish 343 would at least reset csr every month..they gave into the pressure from the mlg community when it comes to csr..its bullshit..and i believe they lost people because of the csr..most players play more on the casual side
GameSack Im will to do it if your willing to teach)
GameSack Thank Satan for emulators...
GameSack They are rare and yet you have FOUR OF THEM? Just lol.
GameSack The US version of Space Harrier for the C64 also used stripes instead of a checkerboard floor. Of course the EuropeanUK one just had a plain gray floor.
GameSack You guys never skimp on info and games when covering a console. You cater to folks who like all genres. Also best fx and capture for youtube retro game channel. Keep it up.
GameSack Losers dont play The Cockpit... but winners dont do drugs. Im confused hahaha.
GameSack Please tell me where you picked up that Mario shirt.
GameSack Holy shit, you guys, what a great overview of the X68K! Thanks for the entertaining and informative video!
GameSack You should cover the amiga and atari st. Great games by comapnies like psygnosis. Maybe lump amiga and cd32 together.
GameSack Lukemorse1 has like 3 of the x68000 that he salvaged i think
GameSack neat system but not worth blowing 200
GameSack Sweet Fugazi TShirt Dave!!!
GameSack marios wacky world and sonic extreme
GameSack Watch this  Capcom should use THIS old prototype for a new IP! :PGAME SACK: Unreleased Games: http:youtu.beLpV2Y32BU?t15m32sCool video btw
GameSack I may not necessarily give a carp about most of the games shown here but, it was still entertaining overall. It is nice to see what kind of games get flushed down the wrapper over the years. So in the end Thank You Game Sack.
GameSack I just about lost it when Joe mentioned Steven Segal being the final solution!
GameSack 19:30 thats the water sound effect in roller coaster tycoon 2!
GameSack Oh man, I love how you say you play as different characters in Star Trek 5. I couldnt tell the difference. I guess the cut scenes tell you?
GameSack Castlevania for the 32x and the dreamcast
GameSack super marios wacky worlds
GameSack Smosh Games A.K.A. Sohiki and Lasercorn play some random games that we dont give a fuck about.
GameSack This is just like tf2 capture the flag
GameSack You could say he got a .... Hedge shot
GameSack Yay im only 3 levels behind Sohinki
GameSack the only problem is that I have a ps3 not 360 and I dont have a nextgen console either so I dont have a console that everybody loves so ill never be able to play with smosh games :(
GameSack Its not even a play ground Joven xD
GameSack Sohinki is like so calm during the game and joven and laser corn are like infinite rage
GameSack runawaythoughts  raywilliamjohnson  rileyrewind
GameSack DO THE HUNGER GAMES IN GTA V PLZ!!!!!!
GameSack You guys should go out in the open with no guns or anything ..just your fist and like fight each other till you guys die.....please that would be awsome
GameSack Lol joven said its the most reinforced playground Ive ever seen. Sohinki ran into a hot dog stand and joven said was it reinforced
GameSack Does anybody know where I could get THAT AWESOME Samus Aran Metroid shirt?
GameSack Do they make that GBA adapter for a PAL Super Nintendo? Ive been dying to play GBA games on the big screen for years!
GameSack Where get the samus tshirt ?
GameSack Have you guys played on the Blaze Sega Megadrive portable games console? If so whats your take on it?
GameSack Does it work with the Sega CD? lol.
GameSack Ive always had problems playing Kirby games as well as super Mario rpg on these portable systems because of the addition of a special chip. Hopefully they fixed this?
GameSack I love you guys so much! The best show ever. Happy old year.
GameSack As much as I would love to play those classic games again, I dont really have an interest in this portable only because I dont feel comfortable with a miniature leaning Tower of Piza.
GameSack Coolest guy in the block  4:22. I agree that the Retro Duo Portable itself isnt too thrilling, but the adapters seem great and its nice that you can get extra controllers and use them on your SNES, because getting extra controllers for old consoles is kind of problematic nowadays, at least for me it seems to be the case.
GameSack 13:45 Am I the only one who noticed the art style looks like another certain indie with trees, odd screenscrolling, and small protagonist?
GameSack Touhou in my GameSack? life 1 step closer to complete!
GameSack You gotta be on RetrowareTV.
GameSack Battle Kid is inspired by I Wanna Be The Guy, a satirical super difficult platformer for the PC from 2009. If you didnt hear about IWBTG then shame on you!
GameSack I know you probably got this a thousand times, but there was a very good hack of MotherEarthbound 3 you should check out sometime.
GameSack Excellent episode as usually, but I have a question about playing some of these English translated hacks especially for my PCEngine CD. How would you go about playing them on the actual hardware? Ive read that playing burnt CD games on the ancient PCEngine CDROM is bad for the lens. I also own a Everdrive with a SD memory card, do you load them using that? What about CD based games like YS and Dracula X Rondo? Im worried I might damage my hardware.
GameSack Try out challenging lolo (a hack of the adventures of lolo) if you like truly brain wrecking puzzles.
GameSack What the hell, how can you not like sonic the hedgehog. You even said sonic was better than Mario!
GameSack Hey Rusted Logic: FINISH SUPER MARIO ODYSSEY!
GameSack gabs das im RIP? wenn ja, hab ichs wohl irgendwie verpasst...
GameSack PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN!!!
GameSack This is very similar to Ratchet and Clank All 4 One. Even the sounds.
GameSack Play League of Legends !!!
GameSack P lease play some more of this game
GameSack Id like some more of this.
GameSack knack is actually a pretty cool game me and my sister actually finished the game
GameSack Make it work with BoR please? Back attachements are useless for me atm..
GameSack Great vid TVM. Making good games now. Keep em up.
GameSack its soccer in Australia too!
GameSack My favorite is probably Neo Turf Masters.ON THE GREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN!
GameSack Ive always liked FIFAgames and some NHL ones too BUT my absolute favorite sports game ever must be NBA Street series (from 1 to v3)
GameSack Fun review, maybe include hockey or rugby in next video perhaps ?
GameSack Hopefully in part 2 you guys do nba jam and nfl blitz , great games.
GameSack What about Olympic Gold?? Great review as always!
GameSack Cant believe you overlooked Super Tecmo Bowl for the NES. Best of the series, Dave!
GameSack Not at all a fan of sports games, as much of a sports fan as I am. They try so hard to be realistic they took out the fun. The most fun I had in a sports game: Hot Shots Golf 3, and I cant stand watching real golf, but this game is fun and doesnt take itself seriously.
GameSack LOL at the skit at the end. You should do a DVD of all the skits. The episodes are good too I guess.
GameSack was fr ein pc hast du dakuja
GameSack Bandit Keith wrote this articleThen why doesnt it say New Changes to the YuGiOh! Championship Series... IN AMERICA!?
GameSack The stupidity of people about this topic is beyond me. Anybody who plays Magic will know how skill based sealed is. This system eliminates all of the bad and unlucky players straight away in top 16.
GameSack idk why but I found this hilarious.
GameSack maybe they could have a selected amount of cards that will be allowed to use in this draft and then you will have to construct them that way everyone will have acess to the same cards
GameSack I like this because some asshole cant spend money on a top meta. It works more around strategy of the player. If you get enough packs for a 40 card deck, the chances of getting nothing are so slim.
GameSack this is very unfair to the other players because there is no limit to how many packs they can buy so it is clear that even the competitive player will still win because he most likely to buy 20 packs and others will buy 24 giving them a bigger advantage at the tournament because people are using shit decks and there is more constructed I think they should limit the amount to packs they can buy but then again they can just go to a shop and come back on day 2 or 3 saying they pulled all of them
GameSack This is a actually a good thing azneyes, the draft makes it so every card has a decision, minus the fact that you can get some broke cards. It reminds me from back in the day where kids had random cards. ARG Open are where its at though haha
GameSack Draft is very different to sealed. You get one card from a pack before you pass it on. You need to both pick what your deck needs, and try to figure out what the people next to you are taking, so you can deny them what they need, or take early what you feel will be in short supply.
GameSack This is 100 percent luck now
GameSack I think people are providing too much hate than useful suggestions. I see what Konami is trying to do here. Theyre trying to eliminate the top 16 decks being nearly the same deck, and the top rounds being a deciding factor of a dice roll, or a ridiculous opening hand. What I think they should do instead is provide some sort of test, like the duel puzzles on YGO pro. Yes, this takes the fun out of it by actually removing the card play aspect, but if youre going to a YCS, and you make top 16, chances are that youre not there for the fun.
GameSack Hey guys, Newish subscriber. Im really enjoying expanding my knowledge of gaming with all the obscure systems and games you guys present. Its nice to have a channel that doesnt talk about how great Zelda is all the time and I really like all the Sega info considering Ive been a NES fanboy my entire life. Solid show, fellas!
GameSack Streets of Rage 2 was a good step up from 1. Also Patapon 2 was so much better than one with better bosses and a lot more content and customisation to do.
GameSack I have one: Majoras Mask is a superior followup to Ocarina of Time.
GameSack Thanks guys for great episode!
GameSack Was Miyamoto really wearing a Sega Saturn TShirt?...LOL.
GameSack The evil dead games actually got better with every sequel
GameSack what is your opinion mega drive version of Devils crush compared to the tg16?thx for the best on the tube!cheers from sweden
GameSack Super Mario Bros. 3, Kirbys Dreamland 2
GameSack BEST REVIEWERS IN YOUTUBESIMPLY tHE BEST
GameSack 0:57  Game Sack just got real.
GameSack I want an AES or MVS more than any other game system right now... Maybe some day soon.Would be great if SNK could pull the plug that embarrassing NEOGEO X and release a real game machine again. Not likely to happen. Id love to buy a proper remake of the system.
GameSack Monday upload? Only a 2 minute video? Wtf is going on here?BTW joe has a pretty decent job. SNK vs Capcom AES is worth about 300.
GameSack Nice Vid. especially the VHS part.... LOL.
GameSack Unsubscribed. Then Resubscribed just to unsubscribe again. The Neo Jio (to use PROPER JAPANESE pronunciation) is nothing to take lightly AT ALL. It had an amazing selection of games and some of the best sprite work and pixel on ANY Console. The Arcade ports were nearly perfect! How would you like it if I made Skanky Anne Frank parody videos? You wouldnt be laughing then, would you? Now, if youll excuse me, I have to close this pathetic window as I have a Neo Jio to emulate.
GameSack Mooaree!!! of this plz...
GameSack Im impressed with how crisps you get the image quality from that Neo Geo.
GameSack Not sure if Google shares videos automatically or not. If not, then here is the latest episode. I dont see it being automatically posted on the page but then again I dont know what Im doing when it comes to Google  :)
GameSack Why no spin tricks during excite truck?
GameSack Suzy Kolber was a sportscaster from ESPN on the Extreme Sports game. I think her best bit of acting was fending off Joe Namath. Broadway Joe
GameSack There is also a shooter in the el viento series which is also glitchy and features Annette in hentai cut scenes
GameSack Jak II it was alright but the original Jak and Daxter was way better IMO
GameSack Great episode guys! I couldnt agree more with you guys I was obsessed with Rocket Knight Adventures and when I played Sparkster it just wasnt the same and kinda left a bad taste in my mouth after playing it! Definitley stick with RKA! :)
GameSack Youre absolutely right, a Crystal Pepsi game seems like a..............wait for it..............clear choice for a video game :) Sorry, I just couldnt help myself.
GameSack Deus Ex.1st is a masterpiece and lies in top 3 best games ever made.2nd an abomination that ruined everything.Also, Ducktales is easy.
GameSack extreme 1 and 2 were both bad for me, but 3xtreme did it right, third try was a lucky charm, and all the hidden characters were just amazing and took the series to a whole different level, spent so man hours playing the game :D

GameSack TGBA  The Gostbusters Army! :D
GameSack LUIS  Leckt Ute ihrn Sack
GameSack Sonic 1 and 2 remastered for iOS and android.
GameSack Castle of Illusion and Duck Tales remakes are also available on PC.
GameSack Unfortunately, the guys in charge of Powered Up have said they were planning on remaking the second Mega Man, but ultimately couldnt due to low sales.
GameSack You forgot about the super Mario advance series. That was the best version of Mario all stars!!!
GameSack Im surprised that you guys didnt talked about the GameCube remakes of Resident Evil  Metal Gear Solid! The remake of Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider Anniversary. Pokemon remakes of Red  Blue. Oh yeah and Pokemon Gold  Silver
GameSack God I hated that Flashback remake. I was so excited for it too, oh well, Ducktales was an awesome remake.
GameSack Do you record with a single cam or multiple? Just curious as some stuff there is... very complex with a single cam :D
GameSack I hate that digital console thing. I wanted to buy Marvel Vs Capcom 2 and its not in the stores anymore.
GameSack digital products piss me off so much, soooooooo many games and dlc get yanked off the market with no reason ever given as to why, like the new game plus dlc for the original Bioshock, last year i won an auction on ebay to buy the game specifically for the new game plus dlc only to find it no longer existed on xbl, i was beyond pissed, and out over a hundred bucks for nothing! this is why digital products should be done away with!
GameSack Mensch, ihr sollt doch mal sagen wann ihr spielt :D Bei den groen Servern wr es sicher lustig eine Runde gegen euch, oder auch mit euch zu zocken. Ich mag das Spiel sehr, hat viel taktischen Charakter, da verstehe ich die Kritiken wirklich nicht...lahmes Gameplay und so. Spielt man ber TS oder hnliches hat es auf jeden Fall einen guten Coop Charakter.
GameSack Haha! When the offense is running a screen it doesnt take much to get to the qb
GameSack Another superb episode guys. One question though which of you owns the black cat in the intro?
GameSack You guys release such great videos, which are far more informative than most youtube gaming channels. Keep up the good work!
GameSack So thats what happened to Monterey Jack from Rescur Rangers...
GameSack At least its a Sonic Doll and not a Tails Doll.
GameSack Awesome guys I wasnt even aware of some of those games. I have a soft spot for tnak controls and survivor horror games.
GameSack You can clearly see that a lot of work is put into GameSack! Great work guys!
GameSack hahah awesome cat intro! X D
GameSack ok, its called Majyuuou and I guess I wont be buying it, its too damn expensive being a japanese game which are usually cheaper than english versions. the reproduction cartridge costs 50 and thats the cheapest copy there is
GameSack I dont know what creepypasta is but it sounds delicious.
GameSack Awesome, thank you! I really wanted to get these put up early, but at this point Im just glad I was able to put them up today at all. :D
GameSack Amazing video. Ive been watching you guys since the start and it seems like the quality is getting better every video!
GameSack I immediately recognized the music from haunting grounds. Or atleast i think it is if not then this post just got awkward but im pretty sure it is so kudos to you.
GameSack makes me wonder if there was a conversation about including a stopmotion turd in this video
GameSack Yes! Well I used to play a lot both indoor and out.
GameSack Lol i love you guys! This is funny! Keep it up :)
GameSack This channel is a hidden gem on YouTube you need more subs get your channel out there more!
GameSack Have you guys ever talked about Blue Stinger? I dont remember seeing it on the show. If its not featuring this Halloween, maybe show it next year. Keep up the good work guys. Cant wait for the new Halloween episode.
GameSack A partition for the crapper and a finished basement? Haunted or not Im interested in the current market value of his home!
GameSack Rubbish review or Mortal Combat 2. Its my favourite game on the 32x and the best version of Mortal Kombat 2. Only the Saturn version has better Graphics but I prefer the 32x version as it has no loading times.
GameSack dudes ur too hard on the system.
GameSack Haha. In every episode, this dude cares about the music more than any other aspect to the game. Makes no sense
GameSack So FIFA, MK 2  Primal Rage dont appeal to you but a snooze fest like Star Trek does?
GameSack If i understand, since you suck at those game than the 32x suck?...
GameSack One of Segas biggest failures of all time!Believe it or not, both Sega CD and 32X suckedass big time!The games were bad, the quality is shit and it required several cords just to operate it! Fucking hell Sega!
GameSack The amount of cables and plug sockets needed to make the 32X and Mega CD work is crazy. The amount of mess behind the machine is insane, i would be afraid a fire might break out if left plugged in over night. Looking at the PS3 or any other modern console shows how things have moved on.
GameSack I think this system needed ports with better graphics and sound. Also a strong line up of original games. Capt. Obvious here.
GameSack I think the only reason to own a 32x is Space Harrier... (And maybe Virtua Racing)
GameSack 1:30 is that a dick i see coming out of the ground...
GameSack 19:38 Actually, Nintendo did make a shooter before Solar Striker. It was an arcade game called Radarscope, and it was a huge bomb. After that, Nintendo brought in Shigeru Miyamoto to make a new game with the same hardware. That game was Donkey Kong.
GameSack Ristar is one of my ALLTIME FAVOURITES!!! The fact that they never released a sequel is a sin! I always imagined a tiein with Sonic of some sort.
GameSack I read somewhere Ristar was originally going to be a Sonic game.. Any truth in this..?
GameSack mischief makers deserves a reboot. Such a quirky fun game. A 3d rendered, 2d platform game. Its great!! Id like to see the metal max series in English over here since the only game thats been in english is metal saga.
GameSack I love Crash Team Racing! Me and my mom would play it all the time when I was a kid. I actually prefer it over Mario Kart to be honest.
GameSack CTR should NOT be on this list.
GameSack Actually nintendos first arcade game that went to america was a space shooter
GameSack Tak and the power of juju
GameSack what is that song during the credits?
GameSack Why did someone disliked the vid :(
GameSack nice, just right click the video and go to properties and click disable resample. it wont look so choppy
GameSack Yah he wake man is back
GameSack They make my day I mean
GameSack amazing ur the best lewis
GameSack Give this guy the utd job. He is so enthusiastic about it
GameSack giggs aint got his badges yet lad. lol
GameSack This guy should be a regular on the show. Hes hilarious and is brutally honest about the inconsistency of Man U.
GameSack Giggs has the passion. Moyes doesnt give a shit
GameSack Say what you want, this guy is a TRUE, Man United fan. Not some armchair fan, a pure Manc supporting his local club. respect
GameSack It happens to all teams look at Liverpool there only just getting back on track after being incredible.. and its just Manchester Uniteds turn.. 20 years or however many it has been is pretty good to maintain being the best team in England and many people would say the world.. So you know take it on the chin your still an incredible team with incredible support, hey if your glory fans give up who needs them you are true fans of a great team.. I support Sheffield United for god sake and that Tevez affair still haunts me when we got relegated from the Prem and look at where we are now.. But i accept that i still go games i still back my team no matter what.. Its hard to go from winning all the time to losing a few, but thats football you cant stay the best forever its just the turn that happens to near enough every team.
GameSack Go on Tate give em hell... Woodward s a clown. Moyes knew he was the manager before the summer and the pair of them failed to get anyone of note (Ill still give Fellaini a chance) but One whole transfer window and now the Jan windows been open 3 weeks and all thats happening is the scouser wants out... (we all know hes going) ......Sack of Cack the lot of them
GameSack As a united fan from India who started supporting them after they were certain to win the bpl, I think either Moyes should stay so we keep losing or we get AVB a manager who knows what he is doing and spends money wisely especially Lamela (moyes should have smapped him up for manu). Im losing hope in moyes and this shit new united squad. I am considering changing to Arsenal, City or Chelsea to support depending on who wins da prem!

GameSack Malaysian wsnker y dont he fuk off from a great history
GameSack Is that where he tore his ACL?
GameSack You have to give him credit for standing up after the sack and walking off that field like a man! lsu geauxtigers
GameSack Les Miles is slowly losing his mojo at LSU. Maybe a move to Texas or USC would do some good. He is weird, but I dont think he is an awful coach.
GameSack RAMMER JAMMER BITCHES!!!
GameSack Thanks for uploading this. Had been hunting it since the game ended.
GameSack Auburns Defense still looks like stick figures at a lot of positions but they have much more discipline this year compared to 2012. i remember the 20032004 defenses looked almost NFL size. This AU team looks like it can win 10 games after a 3 win 2012 season with no conference wins.
GameSack Rods call on this is great. Thanks for uploading this!
GameSack No one wants to talk about football in English. The charm of NMA is talking about football in a language where the natives would never talk about football.
GameSack Do you feel accomplished?
