ZONEofTECH Please please please do Samsung galaxy s4 vs iPhone 5 when s4 comes out "
ZONEofTECH Mine does I did modify bought used smartphone "
ZONEofTECH The 4S only has 512mb ram because OS incredibly optimised thus lagfree OS Android iOS multitasking works same principle The 2nd app paused background while some app services remain active background like VoIP file transfer so The only real multitasking can found Note Galaxy S4 Multiwindow feature where you can run 2 apps same time screen splits half I hope I made myself clear "

retrogametech When we gonna get see complete MVS consolized shell up running "
retrogametech It usually depends console itself For older consoles Like NES SNES MDG others its probably only displaying about 240i only PALNTSC difference being PAL consoles time ran 50Hz NTSC 60Hz Although later consoles Not sure when PAL gets 576i NTSC gets 480i both displaying about 60Hz So look up your consoles see what resolution Hz As 25FPS Vs 24 all really does create problem some DVDs "

GameSack Bandit Keith wrote articleThen why doesnt say New Changes YuGiOh Championship Series IN AMERICA "
GameSack The stupidity people about topic beyond me Anybody who plays Magic know how skill based sealed This system eliminates all bad unlucky players straight away top 16 "
GameSack idk why I found hilarious "
GameSack maybe could have selected amount cards allowed use draft you have construct them way everyone have acess same cards "
GameSack I like because some asshole cant spend money top meta It works more around strategy player If you get enough packs 40 card deck chances getting nothing so slim "
GameSack very unfair other players because limit how many packs can buy so clear even competitive player still win because he most likely buy 20 packs others buy 24 giving them bigger advantage tournament because people using shit decks more constructed I think should limit amount packs can buy again can just go shop come back day 2 3 saying pulled all them "
GameSack This actually good thing azneyes draft makes so every card has decision minus fact you can get some broke cards It reminds me from back day where kids had random cards ARG Open where its though haha "
GameSack Draft very different sealed You get one card from pack before you pass You need both pick what your deck needs try figure out what people next you taking so you can deny them what need take early what you feel short supply "
GameSack This 100 percent luck now "
GameSack I think people providing too much hate than useful suggestions I see what Konami trying do here Theyre trying eliminate top 16 decks being nearly same deck top rounds being deciding factor dice roll ridiculous opening hand What I think should do instead provide some sort test like duel puzzles YGO pro Yes takes fun out actually removing card play aspect youre going YCS you make top 16 chances youre fun "
