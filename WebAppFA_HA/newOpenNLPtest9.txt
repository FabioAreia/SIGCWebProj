TopGear although this car is fast, but it looks very ugly...
TopGear gta v high life dlc anyone?
TopGear The best looking Lamborghini I have seen. If I had the money I would get it.
TopGear Man, the cars sound gave me eargasm.
TopGear My grandma would love this car.........
TopGear This car is useless for a number of reasons, i will attempt to point out a few, 1 this car is made of a very cheap blend of metal that they want to sell for the price of gold, 2 this car doesnt comes with spaceage criteria eg: no blue tooth capability, no iDevice docking, no comfort etc, 3 this car has no resale value, should you waste 2 million credts on this pile of rubbish, it becomes your tattoo, that would be cool except by the end of the year they are going to come with a new one, thus nostalgia would have to comfort for you and your corbonfiber tattoo, 4 this car comes with an engine that can only put out 500  BHP, now, you have much cheaper sports cars that has that capability, with buletooth and a radio, and a dashboard, and resale value etc, 5 its not street legal, you would have to be an ambassador to even afford the paper works to drive this shit. Now that is a very cheap piece of metal, with a mediocre engine that has no comfort, with a very ugly design, that cant even take a female out of her panties, now for the jackasses who are talking about its their dream car let me educate you, for 2 million creds, you could buy an Audi R8, an Aston Martin DB(whatever) a Rolls Royce drop head, plus a Ghost, a 2015 Porsche 918 spyder, plus all the new muscle cars for 2015, the Audi alone will get you all the college chicks, the Aston Martin, the Lawyer chicks, the Rolls Royce, plenty of Middle Eastern chicks, the Porsche, business class chicks, muscle cars, all the regular chicks, plus they all have resale value, now you might want to resleep that dream because it was really a nightmare
TopGear Interesting fact about this car. Originally, Lamborghini wanted to name is the Bristo Flapamento, but then the workers in the factory revolted, and actually canabalised one of the managers (as in, literally. This apparently happens quite a lot in Italy). The executive board backed off, and went with the name Sesto Elemento, which means Compromising for the sake of national unity. Weird, I know. You can read about the details in the new book 60 years of Lamborghini: the cars and the people.
TopGear id sell my soul to satan for that car .
TopGear Sailing, Really boreing!
TopGear is that your car?yeah.its the wrong way up!hilarious

TopGear What 20 morons disliked this?! Bah!
TopGear Having been impressed with the Vauxhall Monaros incredible power slides, Richard takes the new VXR model out for a test spin around a very wet track. But what will Japans D1 Drifters make of the Monaros power sliding abilities? Powerslides with the D1 Drifters  Top Gear  Series 6  BBCPowerslides with the D1 Drifters  Top Gear  Series 6  BBC
TopGear For my fellow Americans: Vauxhall Monaro  Pontiac GTO
TopGear Perfect! Domani versi che ora lo carichi l altro?
TopGear Im gettin one of these.
TopGear Tim the tool man Taylor would be proud.
TopGear This is how you get the ladies!
TopGear Engine is a 109 horsepower VTR Firestorm 1,000cc engine, but grass cutting is done elctrical, so i wouldn call it a real lawnmower....
TopGear lol.  Id like to see it cut a long strip of grass at high speed.
TopGear My umk brush cutter is faster.
TopGear 116.575 mph  187.61 kmh wow
TopGear Its annoying to know that this happens just down the road from me and I have no idea about it :
TopGear how fast was the lap? since we have to wait until june or so for top gear to do a powerlap in the P1
TopGear 01:11.8 my prediction
TopGear Poor P1 on such a crappy track!! Yes I know it was in race mode and stiff but still :(
TopGear Down shift sounds is awesome, love the color too. good look on the vid Docta. Be Safe).
TopGear So much better than LaFerrari
TopGear hehe prima o poi tavrebbero rotto i cogl.... cmq in gamba che ti seguiremo ankora,,grazie !!
TopGear This is actually a fitting analogy. Jezza is Kirk, May is Spock and Hammond being the practical sort of fellow, is Scotty. :D
TopGear My favorite segment of all time. So funny.
TopGear please, have you learnt anything guys, never give a map to James May
TopGear A bunch of idiots. And I watched it!!
TopGear Man did u see the size of that wier it was like 1 maybe 1 and a half metres pure rebal
TopGear that would be something jeremy would do
TopGear SAAB mediocre at best?.....this is the sort of infantile gigglechallenge bred in the land of automotive myopia. The only front wheel drive car I liked well enough to buy was the 9000 and it would have been a better car as a rear drive...That said, there are SAABs I didnt like yet the motoring world gave the 9000 rave reviews year after year ,and it was well deserved. The driving position and outlook for example in the 9000 is better than any other vehicle. Safety excelled in the 9000. The motors are brilliant though my Cosworth 4wd Ford is along the same lines and is rwd. The Americans introduced the rear end wallow as can be seen in the 95 in this Clarkson fantasy race. Instead of fixing the few SAAB defects they fixed what wasnt broken but again...that can be repaired also by experienced SAAB small shop specialists. All the same if one watches on, Utube, the SAAB used in the appalling police pursuit of a motorcyclist and pillion passenger both I presume which died and which went for about an hour in Sweden.....you are not looking at a mediocre performance. Like Cosworth, so many SAAB hotups are overdone and perhaps plain stupid and to no good purpose but I have never yet seen a SAAB 9000 advertised for sale ...as were many hotted Cosworths.......because after increasing horsepower by say 200400 the owner found himself unable to drive safely and particularly in UK it seems....... I own 4 of the 2.3 turbos including the Aero, Carlsson and Anniversary only the latter being auto and cannot bring myself to sell them. Even stationary they are a very much and timelessly pretty car............ SAABs demise was largely brought about by resale price free fall and that was due to unscrupulous service agents. You could buy a good house in Australia in a good Northern suburb for well less than the price of an Aero ...a safe car overtaxed to blazes to protect pusboxes like Holden and Ford. .............One SAAB I lookedat had over 7500 for one service!!..I looked for R and R head , recod engine or some major event...no, all small stuff. Over 15 years my biggest outlay has been R and R clutch assembly on one car, and a personal decision as I do to any car I am driving often, Bilstein suspension. ............The cost of replacing engine mounts is a sharp pin in the hip pocket as two are hydraulic. I did that once, recommended by the suspension specialists and found it wasnt needed. One of the great cons was to tell people that the engine had to come out to do gearbox repairs...around 2000 labour...which is a blatant lie....both manual and auto boxed can be removed after removing the LHS wheel and disconnecting the lower suspension point. ..................Like my BMWs, driven well they cost little to run and so I can splurge on my suspension improvements which simple are Bilstein sports shocks maybe springs and certainly tyres and then a truly expert wheel alignment which includes road testing.....I dont use poly bushes...they are a bad idea. ...................The 9000 is a better drivercar than the Carlsson and both are better and more interesting than what spent decades catching up to what these cars were in the 1990s. ...............Mediocre at best ...I dont think so nor did the motoring commentators world wide..., but then what is it being comparedagainst?? A great, el supremo, motor car today has to have one massive asset uber alles...400W1000W channel stereo....To call something mediocre is easy, to know mediocrity quality and real, top quality takes wideranging driver experience.
TopGear It s design is not the Japanese car
TopGear This and the GTR are my dream cars. But this video was shit. I would be better informed by looking at a Wikipedia page than this.
TopGear Wow im reading like most of the comments about this car being superior to Ferraris and Lambos are you guys joking? Lets not forget the 458 with a V8 not a V10 makes more power than the LFA and revs over 9000 rpm and with a formula one gearbox with a much quicker 060 0124 mph and people bashes on us with again the old poor interior qualityexcuse? Someone just wrote one every 15 ferraris catch fire LOL thats funny only 5 over 1500 458italias did, but the fact that a Ferrari catches fire its the perfect opportunity to bash on the most powerful brand in the world lol unbelievable
TopGear LFA is so hot... Thats my kind of super car.
TopGear Georgeous but overpriced
TopGear I would buy this over ferrari and lamborghini and this car not overrated by clarkson because it really is an amazing car made by highest quality japanese manufacturer in 10 years of development and clarkson have driven 10 times more cars than you do
TopGear how could you manage to ruin this video so bad? stupid music misleading title
TopGear Gimme bck that 60sec of my life.49sec for this vid and 11sec for typing this cmmnt.damn you.
TopGear When you put (HQ) in the title make sure the video is just that.
TopGear Those are old chapters?
TopGear stupid advertiser keeps popping out everytime i press the thumbnail anf all it does is loading aghghghg
TopGear Ah the old double exhaust murcielago
TopGear unfortunately its discontinued.
TopGear Murcielago... Bat... Most Lambos are named after bulls that got pardoned in bullfighting for being exceptionally brave, its like a a bullfighting hall of fame I guess. Diablo, Gallardo, Aventador, Reventn... All famous spanish bulls. They get to live the rest of their lives being carefully taken care of and breeding. That is why this one is called Murcielago, a bull that was allowed to walk out of the ring alive in 1879.
TopGear Wow...just series 6...cant believe it.
TopGear and that concludes the road test of the car!
TopGear TopGear Live Moscow 2014 http:ow.lyviI2p full show HD http:ow.lyviKBq
TopGear BBC cant make good shows and as one might expect, cant make good games too. Who takes a dump with the door open while being filmed. And what kind of a moron shows this on an ad.
TopGear I name this ship... Flush
TopGear why do they upload a video 23 times?
TopGear Some say, teenagers cant afford fiesta STs as their insurance is sky high.
TopGear I read it with jeremy clarksons voice.
TopGear how the hell do you make FF car drift? Oh wait, Stig! never mind
TopGear Stigs Teenage Cousin must have just got out of prison advertizing his ass the way they do in ((Prison))
TopGear Pensi di mettere anche la 21 stagione????
TopGear its good, and to be honest range is not the strong point of any supercar.
TopGear I dont think this is the future. I think hybrids are, a small economical petroldiesel engine providing power to a much larger battery.. as seen in F1 (ERS) or the McLaren P1. Problem with fully electric cars is the longevity just isnt there and wont be for some time.
TopGear its like the new f1 cars! cant hear a damn thing lol
TopGear If theres wireless phone charging, you can bet there will be wireless car charging, if not battery swap stations.Electric, petrol, diesel, hydrogen, or biowhatever, there is enough information out there that its actually up to the consumer what they want to power their vehicle with. The technology is here, has been for a while.Petrol heads will continue to burn oil, and speed demons will continue to find a way to go fast regardless of the fuel source.
TopGear Mercedes just lost a small bit of my respect
TopGear no petrol or electric super car will ever match the true power of a warrior: a simple bike :((((
TopGear I thought the first electric super car was the fisker karma
TopGear nice videos top gear company
TopGear The only real problem with EVs now is battery tech. Once the energy and power density get comprable with petrol, petrol is technically obsolete.
TopGear Io non avrei scelto la golf, pi che altro sceglierei una vauxhall astra techline 1600 che costa 21 mila euro, e con gli altri 6mila risparmiati andrei a fare una vacanza per incontrare quei tre di top gear e prendere la loro astra techline
TopGear i put i like! good im writing in English but Im Italian! Thanks a lot!10
TopGear Ma la Ceed lhanno demolita ?
TopGear Its nice looking and has the british feel but honestly, its not worth 195. Not even close. a GTR can kill that thing and it only has a V6 turbo. Step up the game AM.
TopGear 6L V12 only 517 bhp?? And 060mph only 4.1seconds?? Thats very disappointing.
TopGear I was waiting for the Under the Hood Part...
TopGear Take a gander at the new Camaro ZL1 or the Z28. More HP and less .
TopGear Does anyone know the song?
TopGear Does anybody know the name of the song?
TopGear Every Vanquish comes with a free can of pussy remover in the glovey.
TopGear Before you say this isnt fair, remember how american TG raced the slowest Ferrari against that Cadillac.
TopGear Exige also cost a lot more then the mustang and has like no creature comforts
TopGear Lets see it up against a vette or a venom not a muscle car
TopGear 126 dislikes equals 126 mustang owners!
TopGear u put it up against a regular mustang try putting it up against a 2014 shelby gt500: 060 in 3.5 seconds, 662 STOCK horse power, top speed is 200 thats a definate win for the shelby
TopGear The Top Gear track was originally a Lotus track. Of course it turned out this way. Lotuses were designed to excel at turning. Mustangs were meant for drag racing.
TopGear Was that a Concorde at the end of the vid?
TopGear That style Mustang was so nasty. I have a 5.0 now... but only because of the changes, I never liked any of the retro crap Ford did. I never liked how doggy they made their cars when we had the 93 and newer Fbodies as an alternative with great looks and amazing LT1s and LS1s. The 2015 Mustang is going to be even better, and what does Camaro do for 2015, they take away the cool tail lights and give it granny tail lights because they gave the Stingray tail lights that maybe had a 5 similarity to the cool Camaro tail lights. Oh yea this was between Lotus and Mustang.
TopGear hahaha anything is better than a Ford, even if the stig is driving it
TopGear Grandeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :D
TopGear Il doppiatore di Jeremy Clarkson  quello di Capitan Barbossa???

TopGear What city is this? If its still deserted Im taking a car there
TopGear One of the best episodes right here. Street circuit, those 4 cars, and that Top Gear humor.
TopGear They say that the speedhump is very... inquisitive.
TopGear Id take anything but the Ferrari.
TopGear gotta love the assassins creed 3 music during Clarksons turn around the circuit
TopGear James didnt get lost!!!!!!!!!
TopGear thrilling episode. beautiful cars. this is one of my favourite things about top gear...
TopGear Yeah you forgot that no one gives shit about your LA and that the world doesnt revolves around America
TopGear Top Gear is over again. :( Pleeeeease make at least 10 episodes. Or make 7, and just put the rushes (bits of the show that did not get in the show), such as all of the news and such into episodes or a DVD and call it Top Gear Cock Ups! :)
TopGear The Chernobyl episode was incredible, also Aaron Paul, best star yet!
TopGear so is there one more episode after part 2 of the burma special?
TopGear Hammonds attire was atrocious on the two part Christmas Special.
TopGear It was an amazing series!!! My favourite one yet!!!
TopGear Series 21 has been really excellent. Cant wait for Burma part II
TopGear I wonder what the Stig thinks about this series... Im very excited about his feelings :)
TopGear They realy love Dacia Sandero.:)
TopGear During the Chernobyl part, Im half expecting:GET OUT OF HERE STALKER!

TopGear the only problem is...I cant really understand what she is saying sometimes
TopGear The Blue Vanquish is my fav car by far
TopGear I would love to hear her say Ferrari again and again... that accent is beautiful
TopGear I just dont understand her
TopGear She is gorgeous ! A very lovely Scottish lady, eh?
TopGear grazie del tuo impegno
TopGear you hear that? he drove a Konaseg in Need for Speed :P he means Koenigsegg but he says it really weird
TopGear Hes from need for speed movie
TopGear I think Jesse Pinkman looks less of a moron. Aaron Paul is one poor bastard on the other hand.
TopGear Did he really just mispronounce Koenigsegg?
TopGear Ohh boy that clutch..... drop it drop it dont slip that clutch!!!! Aaahhh cmon
TopGear Im sure youre lovin it, but not as funny as a thought ! missing
TopGear It sounds to me that he doest know anything about cars besides the price
TopGear They know they have got the best job! haha
TopGear I dont understand at the last part. Why does Richard need to wait at the line where Jeremy and James can go 1st? o.0
TopGear Not that I come from Europe  but Europe looks so much cooler than the rest of the world. The World is beautiful and interesting and Ive been on 4 continents so far myself but  nothing beats Europe. So old, artistic, cultural and hi tech in the same time.Even when there was the Bosnian War in Eastern Europe  the soldiers hid in 1000 years old monasteries and fought at the Roman walls of Dubrovnik(Kings Landing from GOT). Damn.
TopGear AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Jeremy is the best! :)
TopGear Oh yeah mclaren WOOO :D

TopGear I would like to see how the cars are made
TopGear Thats why you dont redline scoobies. They blow up.
TopGear I so wanna go see them live!! I also want to go while they are doing a live taping at the top gear building  track! That would be amazing!
TopGear I went to Top Gear Live in Norway in 2011. Its the worst piece of scripted garbage ive ever seen. I love Top Gear, but this sucks..
TopGear I was there when that guy jumped over the jaguar in the vid
TopGear Top Gear Live needs to come to America.
TopGear Wet and wild, just like female James Blunt fans at his concert.
TopGear Id never want a track day at the top gear test track because it always seems to be raining....

TopGear Super!! fajnie ze mamy polskiego Top Geara!
TopGear Hammond in Spanish PRICELESS xD
TopGear hahahaha omg the spanish version
TopGear Spanish Hammond.Just... yes.
TopGear Only heard it once in Turkish and i can say it feels very strange to hear them in another voice. Original is the best.
TopGear pour other countries! its like yeah top gear is on, but why cant we hear their voices?oh yeah my country is too dumb to understand english. wedontdub
TopGear And you started with the Hungarian! Thats so cool :D
TopGear so glad that there isnt a dutch voiceover for it.
TopGear I rather watch stuff in their original language and read the subs than dubbed. Dubbed ruins everything.
TopGear isnt BAC British Aircraft Corporation?
TopGear How is it Jeremys Face VS G Force? shouldnt it be moving air or wind instead of G Force?
TopGear Its called the BAC Monkey 3
TopGear Jeremy you old bastard you. Still kicking in the fast track as always haha. Well done.
TopGear The background music is from Need for Speed Undercover on the DS Platform
TopGear BAC Mono or Ariel Atom v8?

TopGear thanks for broadcasting it in german  if you do it, when only with original (english) audio and german subtitles, not this gossiplevel wich they translate to...And lool at TG in Spain (brain overload coming :D )And btw: TG Australia has been RUINED with Season3, Season 2 was waaay better, season 1 was meh (mostly because of the primary host...)
TopGear The only thing that you can get a chance to win a free email service and the Price of the King of the Crown Estate is the most popular and the Price of the Crown Estate. The comments for your help. I have been a while to get your free time to time but I think the best way to get the best way to get the best way for the use of a new York City of London and the Price of course the UK and Ireland and Wales with company number of people who are looking for a couple of weeks ago by the way, and the Price of the Crown Estate
TopGear I love the original, and prefer to watch it in the original version, but I have to say that the German voices actually fit pretty well.
TopGear Im mexican, obviously my mother tongue is Spanish, however I cant stand anything the Spanish voice acting or abything else than the original. It simply is unnatural.
TopGear Why cant all these countries just let it be in english, in the Netherlands we pretty much always let the audio stay its original language.
TopGear I think German and the normal UK Voice are the best ones
TopGear I usually dont like the dubbings here in Italy but when we talk about Top Gear...I LOVE IT. I cant decide if I love more the english (traditional) version or the italian one (specially when Jeremy talks!!)Love you guysCiao ciao :D
TopGear Great Britains version is the best! Every American knows that US version was a joke.
TopGear Respect From PAKISTAN
TopGear I am eternally thankful that they never tried to dub this in Hindi. shudder
TopGear Subtitles are the best option. I get to hear what they really say and no translation can beat that... :D
TopGear I think its important to underline factual :D im really glad german TV broadcaster stopped synchronise TG, and bringing the show with subtitles. Its actual much better in English.
TopGear ive seen this car at nordschleife,
TopGear Imagine a stretch limousine version of this car.
TopGear they should have a racing series for these.
TopGear 1:38 I laughed so hard !!

TopGear Cold rain weather?This is perfect weather for a British show
TopGear Some say the stig has a Norwegian accent, others say Norwegians has the stigs accent!!!
TopGear Maybe it wasnt actually Norwegian and the stig is actually Hekki Kovalainen
TopGear You, guys, do realize that hes an ACTOR and he could have said the Stig has an Indian or Chinese accent with the same straight face (and then act like he wasnt supposed to say it).
TopGear soo..Petter Solberg? that would be great!
TopGear GGGGGRRRRRAAAAAZZZZZIIIIIIEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!

TopGear Commercial for Porche! Their sales fell due to Paul Walker accident
TopGear It looks very pretty in slow motion.However, you can also see very clearly how the car has been setup with jets near the rear exhaust pipes spraying burning material onto the floor. You can also see that ALL the fire on the car is generated by gas jets setup inside various openings in the car.Sure its done as a pretty stunt, but whats the point?
TopGear Truly.. AMAZING..  fine a piece of CRAP !! ..Looks SObad ..I AM Gonna vomit FOR your honour.  SALUTE, britIDIOTS.

Da man sich die Sendungen mit einer deutschen IP nicht ansehen kann, muss man sich jedoch ber einen UKProxy verbinden.Ich habe mir letzte Woche erst die aktuelle Staffel zu Ende angesehen. Die beiden BirmaSpezialsendungen waren auf jeden Fall sehenswert!
TopGear LOL! I watched this on the show last night and laughed so hard.
TopGear dat face at 3:18 about the Panarai, hahaah classic.
TopGear The presenters probably dont even know anything about the magazine, let alone write for it (well...maybe a foreword). Marketing...yuk!
TopGear well what did you expect from them )
TopGear ya need to cut down on the cold cut meats.......
TopGear Great vid, that dog shot mag is only usefule to wipe the ass after pooping.
TopGear No matter the topic Archie always brings the passion. I love these posts. Keep up the great work Archie. PS. I would love to hear you critique anything with a few drinks in you. Youre the best!

TopGear Road tax for bicycles, problem solved.....
TopGear Bumps... am there is a sulotion well actually 2 !  Well Suspenchion  BMX(bad Spelling :P )
TopGear Waiting for series 22. Burma was good too.
TopGear As a cyclist I would just like to say that this was bloody hilarious. The amount of people that jump red lights and generally dont have a clue what theyre doing is ridiculous. Cycling in the city isnt hard, just show where youre going and people are lenient. Apart from the odd bus and taxi driver, most people are fine
TopGear these guyz r simply awsome :) topgearlover
TopGear Ok, I always drive to opposite lane so I can leave a big gap between my car n the cyclists which can put myself to danger when some cyclists are very considerate to drive in the middle of the lane or during holiday time, they like to cycle side by side with friend s, so why asking us to be considerate when the problem is actually on them?
TopGear James: Look at him, hes wearing normal clothing the lunatic!Jeremy: YOULL BE KILLED!!!!!
TopGear ohh come on!! wheres the full version :(
TopGear what mustard Hammond have on his shirt ? :D .. u could watch these top gear episodes all day long! Best entertainment !

TopGear when he crashed to the limo that was fake
TopGear Most Crown Vic cabs are retired police interceptors
TopGear FIA on stigs suit! 0:45
TopGear Its not a real Stig. Real Stig would have listened to Chineese language lesson or something...
TopGear Only 1 Hour and 6 Minutes left until Top Gear Series 21 Episode 6: The Burma Special Part 12 airs at 8:00pm on BBC Two in the United Kingdom!
TopGear I hope they test the Corvette in the next season.
TopGear they didnt make a review of the ferrari laferrari yet? what the heck?!
TopGear 10:21 of wasted time.
TopGear Top Granddaddies. And I still love to see them in action.
TopGear major error on their part, thinking its still dangerous there... In fact the background radiation in the exclusion zone is no more than in the rest of the country, except for a few small hot spots.And those are easily avoided, especially if you stay on the roads.
TopGear ford transit :((())))))
TopGear Anybody know the music at 06:24?
TopGear No, Ive changed my mind, it pretty much IS war now.
TopGear I loved this episode!
TopGear Low speed, high gear, foot flat uses more fuel than low gear, high revs, half throttle.
TopGear BBC pls stop posting some of TopGears videos on BBC channel and some on TopGear channel, its confusing.
TopGear What happened next? Did the other two die of radiation?!
TopGear In these conditions, this Mercedes Gwagon suddenly makes a lot more sense than a Range Rover.
TopGear tehs cantre is saudiArabia no abudabe
TopGear As soon as the cameras are off he went out and bought one.
TopGear Can u do a burnout??? Please!!!!!
TopGear The Rub Al Khali (Empty Quarter) is a part of southern Saudi Arabia  not Abu Dhabi.
TopGear how the hec did this vid get 197 dislikes?? And wonder if could climb up that Dune?
TopGear i dont see why theres not more of these around on the roads
TopGear He just...sodded off! XD
TopGear Ill upload more Top Gear Video on my second channel :https:www.youtube.comchannelUC9lIU4gWUztUURQzRp8hWeQ
TopGear With four wheel steering maneuverability would be comparable... I just want to see a Lamborghini body on a monster truck. How hard could it be?
TopGear Weird how Dodge made a concept 6x6 and when the German company bought them said it wouldnt be viable, pointless and no one would want it....now they make this...bs all the way! Good looking though
TopGear Looks like a handful. Can we see a dry lap?
TopGear Hed do much better on a dry track.
TopGear OMG Im British so I see the American behind the scenes
TopGear I love the special episodes
TopGear Sorry I dont get it sending 3 guys  a film crew to Burma  film a staged set up This is being payed with tv licence fees  the same for the American trip completely staged
TopGear FINALLY! This special is so late.
TopGear You are right but this one is extrem And making episode there is unacceptable iam taking about agovernment that is killing theme by its army
TopGear I still maintain that a trans Canada, Trans Russia and Trans Australia might be good ideas, e.g. Here in Kaliningrad, you will attempt to do what the Germans failed to do, reach Moscow in under... days
TopGear Looks hard to drive.but i guess is fun
TopGear What Top Gear didnt say: unofficially the fastest car on their straight (300 kmh), 060 in 2.6 sec in a car with manual gear and rear wheel drive. The car cant put down more than 400 hp in those conditions. And as for the fire: even highly engineered Porsches catches on fire these days... Just felt like defending my countries only car :)
TopGear After watching s21 ep4 now you know its normal for supercars to go on fire
TopGear The weather conditions look horrible for a car that has 1000 hp. I guess the Zenvo isnt the easiest car to drive either.
TopGear cant believe it caught on fire...
TopGear it looks bumpy as all heck!
TopGear Show more like that!!!
TopGear Many unrefinement. So no quality. Much denmark. Very fire. Wow
TopGear If only the car have red and white stripe...
TopGear I am SO glad that they went for an orchestral soundtrack for ME 3, the music for the first two games were alright, but 3s blows them out of the water.
TopGear Goosebumps all over when I heard it... Lot of wrong with ME3 but the music is just epic and fits so well to this piece... well done topgear . Love the car too!
TopGear Shepard its a dooms day reaper devise
TopGear The Dubai police force must have hands down the coolest fleet of police cars of any police department on the planet
TopGear lol Dubai is a joke. They just want to have the largest this and the most expensive that.
TopGear Please what does he sat at 0:22 ?
TopGear The only reason to be a police man over there
TopGear what if this went wrong
TopGear I cant stop watching this, its so freaking cool!
TopGear Nice video..I do reviews on cars too. Check it out )
TopGear this is wauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!!!
TopGear By now.. lotus elise sucks..
TopGear At 3:15 theres a ferrari 360 modena and a porsche 991 911 pulling out:)
TopGear Guarda questo video su YouTube:
TopGear So, whats the big deal again?
TopGear Lame. Done 100x times. And lame.
TopGear Supercars are not sports cars like in this video, Supercar are worth millions, like bugatti,koenigsegg,mclaren etc...these are just middleclass sportscars
TopGear Chevy Camaro is better looking than both of these terrible looking cars the Ferrari is gay and the Porsche looks tacky
TopGear Man that fendt is worth more then a honda ciciv wow
TopGear Brilliant. Im laughing as hard as Matt Damon and Bill Murray!
TopGear was that a weird engine note ir did stigy miss a gear at like 18 seconds

TopGear God damn this guys red!
TopGear Seen the episode, IT WAS EPIC!!!!!!!!
TopGear You guys cant do anything wrong. Another great Show!
TopGear Jeremy Clarksons face after Hammond says, Id love to be a drunk Queen. :)
TopGear I will upvote you because i love Top Gear, and because i think the spider guy is fucking stupid.
TopGear Wow... I know everyone is rooting for Tom Hiddleston, but this dripping wet Nick Dalton is rather hot. Plus dimples.
TopGear Theyre all drunk out of their minds, but that makes this show so good.
TopGear Why does Bill say Mark Wahlberg at the end?
TopGear Cant remember when I laughed so much. Matt Damon and Bill Murray were just superb as was Hugh B. Its such a lovely show  yes, Graham can be bitchy, but you just know hes a great chap and really brings out the best in his guests. I loved it at the end of the actual show when Matt Damon said that he had never had more fun on a talk show  and he meant it. Bravo Graham!
TopGear This episode was hilarious , i watched it , had to come back and catch up again on youtube.
ZONEofTECH What about the lolipop girl poster?

TopGear why didnt you pick the speed boat
TopGear Nick can use a sail boat and tom uses a faggio
TopGear Yes you can drink milk straight from a cow but it will take time to get used to
TopGear This top gear thing is a really good idea! You guys should make more episodes and do some reviews of the cars on the way and give some personal opinions, you know, like the tv show.
TopGear 062 mph in 2.5 seconds... Dang
TopGear careful of copyright aha
TopGear Oh also, 600 videos! :D

TopGear Is toby in the show normally now
TopGear Its crazy how real forza 5 looks
TopGear Give us back the c9!! Tired of only using the Mazda, why have it where theres only one car thats competitive
TopGear As long as gamers, racers and true Forza fans are buying anything that MS throw with T10 on market, Forza title will be worst and worst.Simply stop moaning and buying this crap. I understood it somewhere around Horizon and famous forza physics lie. Dont get me wrong, i wish one day Forza would be again worth naming MOTORSPORT, but till then dont buy this 40 of Forza 4 contend in omg 1080 60 fps....Anyway, thanks T10 for pushing me to explore amazing content of pCars, Assetto, GSC, R3E, DTM, Formula Truck, F1 and many others.
TopGear Where is the Huracan? :( Please turn 10 add some new cars other than 2. I feel bad for the car pass owners
TopGear Anybody know what the song in the trailer is?
TopGear Not sure what these have to do with Top Gear
TopGear Really? Like really?? This is im not even going too bother getting Xbox one or Forza 5! Same cars?? Cime on!
TopGear Different month, same crap... Way to go T10
TopGear A.CarmineB.CarmineC.CarmineD.CarmineNotice How It Goes A,B,C Order
TopGear silly me thinking the new cars i suddenly got were actually a free pack.all it was was a season pass pack that came early for some reason. this so called big suprise early april better make up for it.
TopGear Get ready for the fanboy vs. troll war...
TopGear Dont understand how this is a top gear pack...having seen every episode.
TopGear I dont think its a problem we see most of the past cars, because some of these cars are great and a lot of people like them. What I think is really stupid, is that they now have openwheel and they dont even utilize it... theres barely any open wheels in this game.
TopGear Ummm WTF no Alphas? At least a Reliant Robin or a Tacoma?
TopGear Am I the only one that can buy them now?
TopGear Top Gears channel liked this video
TopGear Oh god, I need a Xbox One now!!!
TopGear 15K show cars (good looking and have to be quick)

TopGear Nick I have a question can you do gran turismo 6 or more FORZA 5 I like your channel I subbed
TopGear My car may have over taken you on the last race if it wasnt damaged :P
TopGear would be awesome if someone could use a maurader
TopGear didnt they use a volvo 240 in like series 3 to jump with the caravans?
TopGear This looks surprisingly familiar from my channel.
TopGear Near the middle of the video, my iPod gen. 5s screen started to glitch and went from 1080p to 240 .
TopGear the gt500 for best looking and best car
TopGear I did a 500k budget build Holy crap I got my car going crazy just 0 to 100mph is around 2.3 seconds and zero point nine for 0to60
TopGear This is Top Gear race the Stig, an endless runner that feels a bit like a cash in.
TopGear You may want to use manual and clutchYet they have 3 cars with flappy paddle gearboxes xD
TopGear Nick can you please add me the Xbox One gamertag is TRXhunt.
TopGear I always drift interior
TopGear Make Best old Ford please
TopGear I played this a lot back in the day and I remember it being the most unremarkable game Ive ever owned. It was the racing game with the hot dog car that was all I could remember, I actually realized that this was the game about two minutes into the review...Oh shit, I just realized I didnt own this, I owned the sequel Top Gear Overdrive.Okay, I guess I dont have memories of Top Gear Rally. Oops.
TopGear I use to own this game and the sequels but I did enjoy the original the most.
TopGear In car view too hard for you guys?
TopGear Do a suv challengetruck challenge

TopGear The Hatchiroku (AE86) (Toyota Corolla) is the best car out of all of them. Although i like the GMC Syclone, the paint is disgusting.
TopGear the guy that bought the trueno sounds like fucking jesse eisenberg
TopGear That Miata should have Clarksons dually 6wheel design.
TopGear you should due f1 challenges

GameSack Smooth transition into loops :D Will be using this for my draft mode champion selection untill I get sick of it, if thats possible :D
GameSack i love the song even though i love rengar :D and the song gets me to move and i even fink its the best music jungle EVAR
GameSack I can, but I need the music files for it. if someone can point me to both the intro and loop ambient music files (see this videos description for location on your computer and what the files are called) for the Draven patch, then I can work on it.

TopGear Gold digger.... Really pissing off theyre being sued for this... Shes nt even Chinese....
TopGear This lawsuit is the dumbest lawsuit ever, he said there is a slope on it I heard Richard say you are right, it is definitely higher on the right side.. I dont recall hearing, yea that guy on it is a slope.. Its comedy and humor which Top Gear is known for.. I woul hate to take the people out, who got offended by this, to a Comedy show.. Who knows who theyll try and sue
TopGear The lawsuit is stupid and Id be surprised if she won anything. Having said that, anyone who thinks Jeremy DIDNT know what he was doing when he said but...theres a slope on the bridge (while an Asian man was walking on it) is kidding themselves. It was an obvious jab at another race and Im sorry I had to witness that from someone I thought was a better man than that.
TopGear umm how is this racist lmao
TopGear Dafuq happened to their voices?
TopGear Shouldve asked the company I drive for to borrow one of their taxis
TopGear voices are lower and its disturbing

TopGear That Ucra is no Super Car, a Super Car must do it all, be nice, handle great, fast as hell with all modern conveniences such as AC, heater, stereo and a ROOF.
TopGear When the soda all fell i laughed and drooled sprite out of my mouth. So funny
TopGear I dont see why the Toyota would be so bad, in top gear UK its called the car that never dies.
TopGear Bacana ein? Show... eu era bom demais nesse jogo. O foda era anotar os password num papel pra jogar em um outro dia... kkkkk

TopGear And you need to get a tripod for the camera. or a recording hack device.
TopGear What is this song called?
TopGear Whoa! Cool speakers :D
TopGear lol they play batman music through the whole montage! awesome BBC!
ZONEofTECH I dont personally think they would use saphire glass because it would have no felixibility therefore making it an ipod nano with a bit of a better resolution and much more stronger. It would make more sense to use willow glass.
ZONEofTECH this might take alot of space (maybe because i know KINDA nothing about memory) but if they combind all three of those charging ideas, while your walking outside or inside, the light shines on the watch to charge it and your moving at the same time so it does the double of charging. If you charge it on the panel thing or in that charging case then it does kind of the same but its not moving and the bulb doesnt produce as much as light but it still can almost 2 times the charging without a plug (kina). Again, I dont know if they could do that or even fit that in a small tiny little device  the 5 to 7 days battery
ZONEofTECH dude this is fake apple watch
ZONEofTECH How About the social aspect?Twitter, Facebook etc.?
ZONEofTECH i dont think they will use solar powered cuz wat if its snowing and there is no sun?
ZONEofTECH why do you promote stuff like clarence and cell phone companies
ZONEofTECH Movement and solar charging would be a good combination
ZONEofTECH The best prediction yet
ZONEofTECH I would say the 2 is soooo AWESOME!!!! )
ZONEofTECH Add some chamfered edges to Todd Hamiltons design, and then you have Jony Ives iWatch!
ZONEofTECH I cant wait until 2019!
ZONEofTECH you look like the guy from spider man
ZONEofTECH At number 2 they said thats how the Iphone 5 will look...Now they say thats how the Iphone 6 will lookNext year they going to say that,thats how the Iphone 7 will look
ZONEofTECH The favorite one is is the third and this is how is it going to like but not the same but at least similar like that but I loved the 2nd one
ZONEofTECH I can even understand what their saying because their accents
ZONEofTECH he called number 4 parody? yes, it is hhaha the rest can be awesome
ZONEofTECH I love the number 1 iPhone. I would work my ass off just to make the money to get it lol.
ZONEofTECH i love the thinness of 1 and the probability of it happening. But lets put the keyboard and monitor projector on it too! Thats so sick!
ZONEofTECH Its not going to be a drastic change even though its going up a whole number their just going to copy something someone else did and TRY to make it better
ZONEofTECH So basically, its going to be a big piece of shit like all of the other iphones?
ZONEofTECH Whats the deal with apple copied android android copied apple nonsense? When new technology develops every brand has to have it. Would they just not put it in there devices because if so then that means the brand that has the technology has the advantage in sales because everyone wants it. The sales for which ever brand that did not put the new technology in there devices will be facing bad sales. And we all know that every brand is money hungry. Basically what ever is new all brands will have it no matter what.
ZONEofTECH No it is grapine I bet half of you guys nevrer heard of it
ZONEofTECH Since when does Andrew Garfield do youtube
ZONEofTECH Andrew Garfield??? is that you??
ZONEofTECH How about flash player
ZONEofTECH He looks like the Amazing Spiderman
ZONEofTECH I wonder how much of the audience are actual Apple users.
ZONEofTECH No no no Apple is the one that be rushing they stuff like remember when they came out with the iPhone 5 then out of no where the 5c and 5s like what the heck
ZONEofTECH I like the intro music better than the phone
ZONEofTECH Just cause they will have the s5 in Gold as well, that color will knock out the sales the first week its release. iPhone and galaxy s5 sales will be very similar during that first week, I bet.
ZONEofTECH I like living here in Silicon Valley
ZONEofTECH Very Nice Presentation. This Galaxy S5 Will Rock The Tech World But I Still Interested in S4 Coz The Complete Internal Innovation of Smartphone Sensors Started From it!
ZONEofTECH Cool Video, liked it.
ZONEofTECH I agree with your second theory. Personally (on another topic) I dont see the need for more than 2030 apps? So many of the apps could be just boiled down in their categories since they seem to perform the same functions.
ZONEofTECH Nice video editing !!!
ZONEofTECH i really like this iphone its so cool
ZONEofTECH Why all the dislikes this is a great video
ZONEofTECH Can you give me the link of the last second background sound I really like it !!!
ZONEofTECH you can tell the display size by using the lightning connector as a reference
ZONEofTECH Ill slAp some 1 if they buy this shit
ZONEofTECH What is the point of making another iPhone when you could just keep on making updates and features for the original iPhone?
ZONEofTECH fake ! iphone fans keep dreaming !!!!  waiting for the samsung s5

ZONEofTECH 720p is amazing for laptop gaming, anything higher is just over kill. Specially when using any monitor under 24.
ZONEofTECH how can you play battlefield 4 on mac? a special program?
ZONEofTECH Hey man! do you need a cooling pad for hour long gaming with bf4?
ZONEofTECH Dude how do you play bf4 on your macbook????

ZONEofTECH Im so excited!!! Im going on a vacation next wednesday but when I get back Im gonna order this exact laptop :) I have a base model 2007 iMac so... I think its about time to upgrade haha. Quick question though... do you think spending the extra bit of cash for 2.6ghz is worth it? Is there any noticeable difference between 2.3 and 2.6? Im doing video and photo editing and I wont be upgrading for another 45 years.

ZONEofTECH NEW VIDEO!iPhone 5C vs 4S  BOOT TEST
ZONEofTECH I agree with you Darek Burch

ZONEofTECH just buy another brand, why apple ? . iPhone 4S is outdated and overpriced
ZONEofTECH Of the IPhone 5s is to Cheap for you, than the iPhone 5c is also to Cheap

ZONEofTECH I think that they used too much gold models on the display floor
ZONEofTECH Yeah man this site is just giving out comletely free Pink Apple new iPads for today only. But you do have to be fill out your email id but it is legit, I claimed mine just before. Better hurry up! UPAD3.COM A chill penetrating wail of outrage screamed up from the depts of the Abyss. So loud and horrifying was it that all the citizens of Palanthas woke shruddering from even the deepest slee
ZONEofTECH I never understood the price gouging on extra storage. Like 100 for an extra 16 gigs internally while for 15 I got a 32 gb micro sd card with adapter. Same gripe on the nonstandard expensive cables...just why?And for the price of the 5c version, they could have used a colored aluminum.
ZONEofTECH thanks so much for this video, i am going to buy an iPhone 5c green
ZONEofTECH he sounded like charles xavier when he talking when setting up apple id

ZONEofTECH The final part Mr Bean dance is hilarious .and awesome Nokia commercial :)
ZONEofTECH Nokia fucking rules again! the Lumia series is so cool!
ZONEofTECH How is this the same? First of all we dont know the price yet. Secondly, the Mac Pro is all about performance, and this thing runs circles around the old one. Lastly, the 6 thunderbolt 2.0 ports allow for unheard of expansion in capabilities. So whats with the same shit?
ZONEofTECH Yes upload the unboxing of Iphone 5c
ZONEofTECH Can i have the headphones!?!?!?

ZONEofTECH help recboot is opening! im using windows 8
ZONEofTECH This works. Simple. Thanks!!!
ZONEofTECH Whenever I look in the settings the update does not show can someone tell me how to fix this
ZONEofTECH The reason youre getting an error is because millions of people worldwide are trying to download iOS 7 straight away. Just wait a few hours or a couple days and try again. The apple servers just cant handle it, nothing wrong with your iPod.
ZONEofTECH Thank a lot, youre my heroe dude
ZONEofTECH if i have an ipod 5 can i install ios 7 on settings
ZONEofTECH Doesnt Remove my applications?
ZONEofTECH I need someone to reply to me ASAP! Do I need to go into my phone and back it up from the general settings or can i just do it in itunes on icloud? Please respond

ZONEofTECH mine keeps saying it couldnt be updated. an unknown error has occered.(3194) HELPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
ZONEofTECH Whats the links to download it
ZONEofTECH After searching for hours I am able to find download link for iOS 7 beta3 from .kappleos7.om and Download is safe and secure. I noticed i did not loose any data after update. When iOS 7 greets you on its boot its just wonderful Worth every try to upgrade to iOS 7. You can also download iOS 7 beta 3 from .kappleos7.om
ZONEofTECH Correction  S4 doesnt have the highest ppi. HTC One does.
ZONEofTECH its no available for europe and arabic country?
ZONEofTECH Fail. He tapped the radio song but it didnt respond. Btw I like the old ver better. So Im not updating
ZONEofTECH HEY APPLE!!! SWITCH THE GODDAMN MUSIC APP BACK!!!!
ZONEofTECH I cant even get music to play can somebody help me?
ZONEofTECH But sometimes I dont want to update my apps! What
ZONEofTECH if you learn more about the design youll find out why the design is bad. its very very hard to expand
ZONEofTECH The Dual Ethernet Adapters would make for the most ballin and overpriced unix routerfirewall EVER!
ZONEofTECH 0:50 Epic! :D Fuck you android NFC sharing!
ZONEofTECH And added instant discovery and a proper interface.
ZONEofTECH Great! I still have no clue how this works but I do not its not available on my iPad 3! I guess if I really want this feature, I need to buy myself a new iPad. Thanks Apple.
ZONEofTECH Why they aint make it for iphone 4 that would have been smart more teens have 4 apple huhhhh that just made me pissed off
ZONEofTECH Its called WIFI Direct on Android and its been there for a while now..
ZONEofTECH For people who dont understand what NFC is like: you know when u take the public transport or use a card and scan it to read it, well thats a form of NFC. So we all use NFC already.
ZONEofTECH I dont see any hate comments. Dont feel offended.
ZONEofTECH I use chrome on my iPhone right now, should I switch to Safari when iOS7 hits the market?
ZONEofTECH Will ios 7 delete the safari version of youtube? Because Id be super pissed if it did.
ZONEofTECH Nice!!! Just like WebOS in 2010..
ZONEofTECH They just improved something they already had.
ZONEofTECH tripleE02 I am impressed with it as well. I was one of the people who emailed their accessibility team and said they should make the voice of Siri and VoiceOver Sound like a person. And I think whoever read that email took it very seriously and passed it onto the people who are in charge of the iOS software. Thats what I like about companies like Apple. Is that they take the time to read customers feedback and do whatever they can to satisfy them. :)
ZONEofTECH I like it. The new voices sound friendlier.
ZONEofTECH I love the new Siri voice
ZONEofTECH Yes, Samsung, not Android. IOS 7 is full of Androids old features. People who complain about Android are the people who have lowpowered devices. Get an HTC One or an S4 if you want to judge. I have an iPad 2 and it does have great battery life and performance. But as long as the limitations remain, iOS will never be better than Android. NEVER!!!
ZONEofTECH i wanna smash it bash it kick it that is so dum
ZONEofTECH Back facing camera???WTF!!
ZONEofTECH yessss :D and if I dont win can you send me one apple bag beacause I dont have apple store in my country and I realy want one real apple bag from apple store
ZONEofTECH Cool thanks coz I got the black 4g and I want a upgrade and  I dont really like the band thing and I hardly use the back camera
ZONEofTECH HELP ME PLEASEi installed lol and it gets stuck at 99 for hours and hours and when i re install it does the same thing HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO FIX THIS ?
ZONEofTECH when I press play it disappears. and doesnt appear. help?
ZONEofTECH you download it from monday 22:31 to wednesday 16:1
ZONEofTECH It stops at 99 and it keeps on saying 0:11 second remaining its not moving
ZONEofTECH U can record constantly and upload easier u dont have to buy a screen recorder
ZONEofTECH you think theyll have corded controllers?
ZONEofTECH You must be retarded to think xbox one killed ps4
ZONEofTECH at 0:18, you turned up the volume.
ZONEofTECH Kinect sucks honestly... its pretty much useless in most scenarios. So upgrading that is no excuse to say their console is better. I thought the Xbox 360 rocked and the PS3 sucked. But Now Im definitely leaning towards the PS4. Xbox is just doing everything PS4 announced before.
ZONEofTECH XBOX ONE all in ONE!!
ZONEofTECH Is that realy true?? Youre kidding me.
ZONEofTECH Aww, I was 7th. Oh well, congrats to the winner!
ZONEofTECH Cool video but why dont you buy a samsung if you want all those things...its kind of like what a samsung has actually apple is known for its unique design those ios7 suggestions kinda makes it like a samsung or a windows phone
ZONEofTECH absolutely 1 2 is too complicated to use
ZONEofTECH Hey! I am an apple fan but I realised the third concept music is in one of samsung videos!
ZONEofTECH The last one being 1.
ZONEofTECH They should make u choose from the icons on both iOS but l like the 2 more
ZONEofTECH 3 looks like an android
ZONEofTECH I like the last one best!!! Good Job!
ZONEofTECH I think it will be better than the ps4
ZONEofTECH 300 is not cheep stop saying it cheep
ZONEofTECH guess what its fricken 739 for a 16g and 869 for 32g in australia. gotta love this country
ZONEofTECH GUESS WHAT IPHONE C MEANS.HAHAHA MEANS IPHONE CRAP!
ZONEofTECH I really want a redesigned iphone 6. . . So i might get this cheaper ver. and use it for a year then get the iphone 6 when it comes out.
ZONEofTECH how blinded we were back then
ZONEofTECH All of my S4 specs were true, except for the design. I got the camera , the CPU , the Storage , the Screen size  ,the Screen PPI ,the OS , the special features such as AirPlay right. The only rumour that did not turn up true for the S4, was the design, other that that I was 100 right. You havent paid any attention when you watched my video, or youre just trolling.
ZONEofTECH I know that. Thats why I said that its almost as big as the iPad mini.
ZONEofTECH Definitely the Galaxy S4. You get a lot more features with that, which you do not get on the Note2 such as AirPlay, GroupPlay, SmartScroll and stuff like that. Check out my top 10 S4 features video for a more detailed look at the S4. youtube.comwatch?vbWTx04Ojy6o
ZONEofTECH sorry but the samsung galaxy s3 mini is better than iphone 4s
ZONEofTECH i have the samsung galaxy s3 mini but im saving my money for the iphone 4s
ZONEofTECH A great review. Thats helped me decide which phone to get. The Samsung for me and my wife. cheers
ZONEofTECH Yes, you can output video to a tv with the S3 Mini, same goes with the iPhone (the iPhone 4S can even output wireless to the TV but you need to buy the Apple TV which costs 100). For the S3 Mini, you need an additional adaptor.
ZONEofTECH I know :) Its by far, the most complete review on YouTube!
ZONEofTECH notverystealthy excellent commentary!
ZONEofTECH I dont think these should have been compared. Maybe the s3 vs the 4s, but the mini is just a budget version. A contract for the mini is 17 a month ( unlimited data, 5k texts, 100 mins) and the same contract for the 4s is 27, so the price is a HUGE factor. Considering the price, the mini would win every time.
ZONEofTECH Ive seen rumours that all android devices with front facing cameras will get eye tracking. They may not be true but I hope they are. I want to get an android phone.
ZONEofTECH I am going to do that :) Its going to be in the same format as this one. 8 episodes and a main video to link them.
ZONEofTECH 9i hate apple with IOS
ZONEofTECH S3 mini is very better, iPhone is good but s3 mini winner the compair :3
ZONEofTECH The back button is more like a cache of some sort, if you close an app with the backbutton but its still in the recents then it will open faster than if its not in the recents, however an app in the recents doesnt load as fast as an app that was minimized with the homebutton (actually this apps dont load at all because they are actively running in the background) Just some thoughts and criticism, keep up the good work!
ZONEofTECH This was a great video man! Appreciate it! Going with s3 mini though!
ZONEofTECH the samsung galaxy s3 minni clearly won on the second app ..
ZONEofTECH HEY! Whats that EPIC Music called?
ZONEofTECH Thank you, please be kind and share and like this, so it gets the number of views it deserves. Cheers dator!
ZONEofTECH I hav got s3 mini its so good i would recommend to evryone:)
ZONEofTECH Thank you.you helped me so much to choose
ZONEofTECH iPhone looks old and shouldnt be given 5 stars.
ZONEofTECH To much time looking in and out of the box
ZONEofTECH Which is better Sony Xperia Tipo, Miro or this one?
ZONEofTECH Brown color will be the best :) Hope od you will but that :)
ZONEofTECH Apples headphones are In ear
ZONEofTECH okay but... will it blend?
ZONEofTECH If you dont like TouchWiz, dont get a Samsung phone. Simple as that. Dont take away from the stock beauty of the phone itself. Motorola is more of a stock experience compared.
ZONEofTECH Wenn Euch jemand in der UBahn so richtig eine scheuert, dann liegt das an den Airgestures vom Samsung GalaxyS4: Samsung Galaxy S4 HANDS ON  The Verge
ZONEofTECH Of course is better than the i phone my s3 is better can you imagen the s4 . Too much better
ZONEofTECH did he say as translator
ZONEofTECH Seriously, that Virgin Mobil commercial is funny as hell. And I normally hate ads.
ZONEofTECH iPhone 55S KILLER. team android
ZONEofTECH The Last Eye Detection Feature has amazed me... I Mean it would have take them the years to synchronize the eye movement to the screen.. Just WOW
ZONEofTECH 4 days of battery power? lol good one
ZONEofTECH getting the S4 for sure my dad got the iPhone5 ..... S4 is an insanley awsome phone
ZONEofTECH Just to correct you a mistake... The Galaxy S4 isnt the first to have the WIFI ac... the HTC one that came out few weeks before do have it too... Cheers
ZONEofTECH Their trailer looks like its encouraging kids to get the Samsung 4 wtf
ZONEofTECH I have SGS3 and IPhone 5 and I must say hat the i phone is thevreal one and onlay the best
ZONEofTECH Have a look at the HTC ONE then, it beats out this device.
ZONEofTECH This video was made A WEEK BEFORE the Galaxy S was even announced. Everything was just rumours and I WAS 99 right, except for the design. All the specs turned up to be the SAME as the ones in the video. For the FINAL specs and TOP 10 FEATURES, check out my latest video, which covers everything on the new Galaxy S4.
ZONEofTECH It its true...it will be very owesome!!!!
ZONEofTECH VIVA la I Phone forever !Apple Mac I OS is the Bettler vwry Bettler system.I have two, the SGS3 and the IPHONE but I must say that the the I Phone is realy the best and only one phone etc. With all his systems,look and specs and and and....etc.
ZONEofTECH iPhones suck now. They never really change. The same icons and features since the iPhone 1st dropped.. Samsung!!! S4
ZONEofTECH THIS VIDEO IS OLD!  PLEASE CHECK OUT MY NEW VIDEO! youtube.comwatch?vbWTx04Ojy6o 1) New Samsung Galaxy S4 video!! 2) LIVE Release EVENT images! 3) TOP 10 SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 FEATURES! 4) OFFICIAL Galaxy S4 specs revealed by Samsung!
ZONEofTECH cant wait till the real features n pix of the phone come out.. tired of rumors and fake ass pictures of the phone
ZONEofTECH Well yes since its free!!
ZONEofTECH What graphics is that at 3:47 ?? lol
ZONEofTECH Microsoft will never be the front runner of nextgen games. It just cant happen anymore. PS is giving such a hard showing.
ZONEofTECH this doesnt seem like a big step up to me, and the gameplay looks as bad as killzone 3s single player (tho the online was fun)
ZONEofTECH If the graphics are better in the PS4 Im changing to it. But Microsoft has a better economy than Sony, they could possibly have better so never call upon victory when its not clear.
ZONEofTECH Looks like kill zone 3 from ps3
ZONEofTECH Never get in a fight.
ZONEofTECH it is going to be and look like a watch !! :)
ZONEofTECH this i watch is going to be 16 gb and waterproof, scratch proof and 450 dollars in us
ZONEofTECH He is going to lok like on that pictures you show hehe :)
ZONEofTECH i almost fell asleep with this dude. really boring.
ZONEofTECH can it make phone call like my watch phone i have now
ZONEofTECH Damn this is a waste of time. You spend half the vid jabbering on and on about stuff completely unrelated to the subject
ZONEofTECH lol im gonna buy ps4 but ive never even played ps3, i guess its gonna be a big step for me.
ZONEofTECH Thx :) yeah I know the feeling, I have a lot of work to do as well.
ZONEofTECH I found a new way to exit without needing a computer! Just hold the Home Button until the apple logo shows up and it will be as if the iPod just turned on. )
ZONEofTECH Hey Dude...I gotta say thanks too much for this thing. Works like a charm. Though I had other options, but this one beats them all. No restore, no DFU just a click and boom the device is out of the stuck AppleCable logo. have a nice day dude.
ZONEofTECH it doesnt work in my 3gs
ZONEofTECH sorry for uploading it a 2nd time. Had some issues with the 1st one and still have them with this one unfortunately. And yes, its YouTubes fault...
ZONEofTECH Why not just buy a windows pc instead of paying over a 1000 and then installing it on it
ZONEofTECH Does it work on Mavericks ?
ZONEofTECH Awesome and helpful video, i just have a question. Does it work on Mavericks?Can you make a video using Mavericks. Thank you so much!
ZONEofTECH dont use boot camp, get a parallel version from the Apple store, get the windows 8 full version disc and you are ready to go, it takes 10 min. You can use SO X and Windows 8 on your iMac. Dont use boot camp, its too complicated and if you dont know what you are doing, you gonna mess it up, trust me. there is an easier way :)
ZONEofTECH Excuse me, is it possible to Play Windows games or MMOs with this installation ?
ZONEofTECH Why would you want this? Windows 8 is shit
ZONEofTECH I already install the windows 8 but I forgot to install the boot camp if you have any solution for it .. that will be my pleasure thank you
ZONEofTECH activation dfiles.rufilesddfoc7fco
ZONEofTECH No, but I will install it from this video
ZONEofTECH I want to win because all I have is a horrible Chromebook that I can only use for a year.
ZONEofTECH Check this out free windows 8
ZONEofTECH I want to win this because i like the windows 8 very much but I dont have money to buy it
ZONEofTECH I want to win beacause I want to win something and I want windows 8 beacause its cool :) D
ZONEofTECH I want to win becouse I want to try Windows 8 on my PC.
ZONEofTECH I WANT TO WIN SO I COULD HAVE A WINDOW 8 THAT WILL BE SO SWEET
ZONEofTECH i think i should get one because this is going to be my first on and ive always wanted one
ZONEofTECH windows8 please please no money for it i have apart time job please
ZONEofTECH I dont know if I can trust persians
ZONEofTECH So this Burn App will burn my disks to my mac?
ZONEofTECH by the way, I have installed windows 8 as well, going to make a video of it and yes, a windows 8 giveaway is coming :)
ZONEofTECH That no the ipad5 if you want to type in iPad air then thats the iPad :)
ZONEofTECH Apple needs to update its UI. Lose the home button. No mechanical buttons is the way of the future. You guys laughed at the BlackBerry PlayBook, but in reality its UI is proabaly the most modern.
ZONEofTECH THIS IS JUNE MOTHAFUCKA HOW YOU DOIN?
ZONEofTECH It will be like the iPhone 5 but bigger and mb a bit more powerful.I mean itll have the same design style as iPhone 5.
ZONEofTECH The dates are indeed wrong, bad sources. Other than that, all the specs are going to be exactly the same as mentioned in the video.
ZONEofTECH uh duh the iPad 5 is just gonna be like u said it was :P
ZONEofTECH You need to realise it IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE THE MODEL HE SHOWED! Look on HnboxTherapys channel and watch his iPad 5 video before bitching here.
ZONEofTECH nah, I said it in the beginning :) this is actually a REunboxing, so yes. the controller was used, but by me :D By the way, please SUBSCRIBE if you enjoyed my video :) Thx swiing!
ZONEofTECH Grey looks the best ! Way better than the blue one
ZONEofTECH Wow, proves how much you know...
ZONEofTECH June 2013 has passed, whats your next guess for the release date?
ZONEofTECH Isnt super HD the same as 4k? If so I will shit bricks.
ZONEofTECH The new ifone will be came in sell in the next year becose ifone 5 is the best on the markets so the will be waiting for the  so you have to waiting for 1 year
ZONEofTECH its just gona be all like, hey we have a iphone five but we changed 2 things so now its a iphone 5s
ZONEofTECH ost of new apple products come out in fallm
ZONEofTECH Dude come down! If he enjoys making videos, she should do it :)
ZONEofTECH Its August now, so that was wrong.. So its safe to say the rest of the video is wrong too.
ZONEofTECH well this is cool I got a free iTunes Card Code and it was valid! Crazy! Check this site out: freeitunesforever com
ZONEofTECH how can i change the title of songs.. im confused please help thanks
ZONEofTECH how do i delete a song in itunes 11 please help me?
ZONEofTECH i have a folder of music....how do i add the folder to itunes?...also ...how do i view what songs are on my iphone??? im not used to this new ituens.....
ZONEofTECH its not lynx its mavericks but i know that becouse i am from the future
ZONEofTECH i use double windows 7 on my pc and mac os x on my mac and i would like to switch to 10.9!
ZONEofTECH i think siri will just be another button on the dock
ZONEofTECH Using my late 2012 base line iMac and also my 11inch mid 2011 MacBook Air 128GB SSD Both on ML. I cannot wait for OS X 10.9 :D
ZONEofTECH 10.8.2 Mountain LionWin7SP1 (on my MBP) and 10.5.8 Leopard (on my 533MHz Power Mac G4 :D)
ZONEofTECH Xbox 360 because its Fing PROTECTED FROM HACKERS
ZONEofTECH By the way its an 8 core AMD processor at 1.6 ghz not 4 :b
ZONEofTECH sony doesnt own bluray, bluray is licensed and managed by the bluray disc association. anyone can become a member of it just like sony did. microsoft can place bluray drives in anything they want and sony never see a cent. do some research before you post stupid shit.
ZONEofTECH I hope ur allowed to play xbox 360 games and put ur hard drive from the 360 in the 720 cuz i really dont want to start from scratch when i first got xbox live
ZONEofTECH Its something called mass production. When you produce something in mass, you get tons of discounts. So the production cost is going to be around 180200 at the beginning (which means 20 profit per console), but in time the production cost will lower to bout 80100 which is the production cost of a ps3xbox 360 now.
ZONEofTECH Those specs sound like those on my PC...sad it took so long. I also imagine my PC is thinner and lighter than the new Xbox.
ZONEofTECH Considering where consoles are coming from the archetecture will be a decent step up over this current gen in performance. Its not just about the CPU, to run games with better physics  AI a modern low wattage CPU is fine for the job. Next gen consoles are never going to be as powerful as the best gaming PC, but theyll be competitive on priceperformance compared to a similarly priced PC when they come out  for a few years after. Also the amount of RAM isnt as important as speedbandwidth.
ZONEofTECH noob... know your facs... and also NO. NO i5  i7 they need a fucking amd processor becouse amd BLACK FUSION owns together with amdati card
ZONEofTECH your a dumb ass it like 3 times better then the xbox 360 when they make it
ZONEofTECH To me it just started to instaling something i hope this works
ZONEofTECH do you have to win the vs ai battle
ZONEofTECH i discoved unlocking a new potrait in starter edition allows you to choose ramdom :D
ZONEofTECH It does work on HoTS. Ok :) The requests for that video have been INSANE :D Tomorrow (4th of July 2013!) The independence day will bring some independence to Heart of the Swarm as well (if you know what I mean)
ZONEofTECH unless if theyre fixing glitches and bugs, no :( Sadly, we cant face A.I if we can increasetest our skills if we get owned so bad online. Dont you hate that? Its like instead of Oh, you suck online? Here, you can face A.I to increase your skills. Now, its : Oh you suck and get owned so bad? Well screw you.
ZONEofTECH also i somehow managed to find this without help, its like me oh random button,lets just click it just cause 5 seconds later holy crap....im protoss....
ZONEofTECH I had a try 2 times did not work it might of been patched just telling you
ZONEofTECH friend asked me to play terranwhen i went back the glitch failed WORST MISTAKE EVER
ZONEofTECH where is your ipsw link. you need a special one for older devices not just any 6.0 ipsw
ZONEofTECH I reboxed my Leap Motion and threw it into the pit of crap Ill never use again. It definitely has potential and seems exciting, but its a HUGE disappointment thats incredibly cumbersome rather than helpful.
ZONEofTECH Yup, it sure is :) Siri is currently on: iPhone 4s and above, iPod Touch 5th generation, iPad 3 and above and iPad Mini Cheers :)
ZONEofTECH Not worth it. I got first :)
ZONEofTECH waited so long for this, HAPPY!
ZONEofTECH Guys, please LIKE and SHARE this videos so more people can see it. Thank you :D
ZONEofTECH Hehe Cheers mate and congratulations :D !!!!

ZONEofTECH This is such a boring video.

ZONEofTECH Ok, Im just answering this because youre a girl (probably) and your avatar is damn hot. Jailbreak  hack your iPhone so you can install custom Apps, themes basically tweek the entire operating system. And yes, you can get free app store apps. (You didnt hear this from me :D )
ZONEofTECH stick your ipod on the of a huge ass speaker, let it marinade overnight and voila! you get the idea.
ZONEofTECH Bre i aint homo but i love yer accent its tight:)
ZONEofTECH I have the weirdest boner right now...
ZONEofTECH What is that thing on the back, in the upper right corner ??? Cant wait !!!
ZONEofTECH Yeah, most of the ipod fans want this because of siri..is a feature in the 5g
ZONEofTECH Coming out by christmas?
ZONEofTECH shitttttt i have bought an ipod touch 4g on 1st sep 2012 ahhhhhhhhhh!
ZONEofTECH He could always come back and say the ipod is thinner and lighter, or that it has the loop, or it comes in colours, etc........ While I agree with you that the iphone is superior for those two reasons, others may have different priorities and therefore disagree.
ZONEofTECH dont thank us for watching, let us thank you for this effort .. thanks 3
ZONEofTECH By the way, please SUBSCRIBE to my channel for more upcoming videos. I put a lot of effort in making the so a subscription would be greatly appreciated! Thx :D
ZONEofTECH Did others then look at those succeses and copied the ? Of course, just liks LG and apple copied from those before them . Now people whining everybody copied from apple just showed they dont know anything about the history they are talking about.
ZONEofTECH so apple still the best
ZONEofTECH u should make a video on how the ios7 looks like android.
ZONEofTECH this phone is better than the galaxy y duos even it has a smaller screen and a 800mhz processor
ZONEofTECH Was there am earthquake during the first thirty seconds of this video buyatripod
ZONEofTECH IM GETTING 1 IN NOVEMBER!!!! YAY!
ZONEofTECH Lol smaller box means more boxes can fit witch means they use less gas lol Omg that is so hilarious.
ZONEofTECH Dude you have the fake one!
ZONEofTECH The music is a little extra
ZONEofTECH I like the hardware and the software on this device. It still runs well on IOS 6. It is a shame they stopped selling this model.
ZONEofTECH Apple was the beast company in the world for me from about the year 2006 and it even got better when apple introduced iphone 1g but for me apple died in 2011
ZONEofTECH Have a 3Gs (: INDESTRUCTABLE :D
ZONEofTECH Does anyone know what the music was in the beginning?
ZONEofTECH Just bought this a few weeks ago from Gamestop really cheap. Dont give a fuck what snobbish assholes wanna say about it. I didnt even have a smartphone before, so it was an upgrade for me. Sure, it sucks compared to newer phones, but my quality of life is not diminished by having an older phone.
ZONEofTECH Esti din romania. Got the 3gs!
ZONEofTECH Cool :D Be sure to SUBSCRIBE if you found this video useful. Thanks drpay :)

ZONEofTECH can you use it to serve the net for school? or it is just like an ipod touch?
ZONEofTECH Wow apple used to put useful things in the box
ZONEofTECH I have a 3G and 3GS that im not using because I have a regular phone plan. I will probably get a data plan and the 5S or 5C if I renew my contract.

ZONEofTECH This was very helpful. Thank you.
ZONEofTECH Thanks and keep the great work!
ZONEofTECH How can i get Mac OS on a new ssd? MacBook Pro 2009? Just insert the disk? And how to start the disk installation ?
ZONEofTECH You say click restore as the last step but it wont let me. Ugh.
ZONEofTECH Just press any button :) It will turn on in less than a second :D
ZONEofTECH I dont have anything against apple, its just not me. This little gadget however has me wanting to buy one lol. In my own opinion this is the best design for the ipod nano ever made.
ZONEofTECH I cant believe someone actually gave me this for christmas  Overclocking right now
ZONEofTECH nice intro. use a normal voice
ZONEofTECH I know you posted this 5 months ago, but if you really did get this amazing fan, could you tell me what this cooling pads name is? Cos that is cheap :3

screenjunkies Omg I love bill and Ted
screenjunkies Hey dumbass, you dont pay shit for the videos they produce. Quit complaining and skip things you dont want. If they saturate the channel with only Honest Trailers, they could get boring. Let them do what they want. Do you call TV channels and complain when they show things other than your favorite show? Then shut the fuck up.
screenjunkies According to IMDb, yes. Thanks for asking  reading his biographical info was entertaining. )
screenjunkies Was that George Carlin?
screenjunkies I would SO watch this!!!!

GameSack I tired it on the sidewalk and broke my leg
screenjunkies So, by him playing with ponies and seeing the future, he predicted the rise of the Bronies!
screenjunkies Going from talking about frozen spidaweb leggies to talking with a fist full of entertaining celebrities. If thats not the American dreamthen I dont know what is.
screenjunkies Flula is too cute. and i love how Jason Segel is the most serious one with the script. lol
screenjunkies Ed Helms being such a douche. He takes it SOOOOO serious xD
screenjunkies I love how when they read his scenes, they read it in Flula language lol
screenjunkies Flula, I never tire of your videos. My face hurts from the laughter.
screenjunkies Actors trying so hard not to be assholes  We see right through you  haha
screenjunkies Seeing Jason Segel say hapsy warranted an automatic like.
retrogametech Wait? Did I see it right, no Donkey Kong Country 1 or 2, but Donkey Konga is?

screenjunkies 2 words why I watched this Nostalgia Critic
screenjunkies Nunca vi nada sobre a srie, ento... o nico spoiler que tomei  q o cara fica careca huehuehueuheu
screenjunkies pdc que s tem careca nessa srie!! hehauhesuaes
screenjunkies A melhor srie que j vi
screenjunkies Audio in English.Legendas brasileiras.
screenjunkies kkkkkkk eu murri em: quem quer ser um milhonrio
screenjunkies Faz do Independence Day.
screenjunkies The Internship? Ugh, the initial trailer says it all. Cliches and filled with pop culture references instead of original humor.
screenjunkies u told me to say it so i will something funny
screenjunkies Seriously Hal, that was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Is it just me or is he angry
screenjunkies i think you lost him with the anniston bit budy
screenjunkies This film was utter shite
screenjunkies does anyone else notice that Hal always seems on edge? He gets these mini twitches on the right side of his face...
screenjunkies I can win a shirt if I say something funny? If I say something unfunny, can I win some underwear? I need a new pair.
screenjunkies The questions are dumb, in fact hes visibly annoying one of the mechanicsI thought you where going to ask technical questions not troll the mechanics with retarded questions.
screenjunkies The Rock acts a whole lot better so...THE ROCKBut....Vin Diesels mumbling is sort of one of a kind.Hmmm
screenjunkies for all those planning to watch fast  furious 6. keep in mind: way to get ur car up 190mph is to drop from an airplane.
screenjunkies LoL! Fast  Furious  made me leave the movie theatre fast  furious  so from a wicked perspective they did deliver the motto of the film perfectly.
screenjunkies What is a supercharger? What is an intake manifold? What is an engine system?
screenjunkies well, Vin Diesel can see in the dark. The Rock can raise an eyebrow. cant chooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooose
screenjunkies twas a yacht not a boat.
screenjunkies All the way with Vin, oh ya Id let him in, just drop it in the slot, cuz man this guy is HOT!!
screenjunkies Picard  Tom hardy  he already played a younger Picard in a photo and his clone (Shinzon) in NemesisRiker  Richard MaddenWorf  Idris Elba or MJWData  Tom Hiddleston Geordi  Donald GloverTroi  Michelle DockeryCrusher  Christina Hendricks
screenjunkies What was wrong with Frakes acting in the show? I thought he did a good job.
screenjunkies Please no leave it alone already its time to cut jj from Trek
screenjunkies Ayelet Zurher (Lara LorVan, Supermans birthmom in Man Of Steel) as Deanna Troi.
screenjunkies My two cents because I cant help myself. Picard: Cyril Raffaelli Riker: Gerard Butler. Data: Ryan Reynolds. Geordi La Forge: Chiwetel Ejiofor Dr Crusher: Olivia Coleman Troy: Summer Glaue. Tasha Yar: Gwendoline Christie. Warf: Brian Thompson. Guiana: Alfre Woodard.
screenjunkies Im gonna go with Bruce Willis for Picard(its a stretch), Kyle Chandler for Ryker, Marlon Wayans for La Forge, Morris Chestnut for Worf, Toby Maguire as Data, Anne Hathaway for Troi, Asa Butterfield as Wesley C., Jessica Chastain as Beverly C., Katee Sackhoff as Lt. Yar, and Gabrielle Union as Guinan
screenjunkies obvious choice would be for abrams to bring back man from uncle ( yeah i know theyre making a movie )
screenjunkies There.....are.....four....Lights
screenjunkies Marion Cotillard FTW!
screenjunkies Jason Momoa as Worff, maybe?You know, Khal Drogo...
screenjunkies He already has the funding....
screenjunkies I love Zach and thanks to this clip I am going to donate on kickstarter. First I was like nah, Zach and the other fans can pull it off. But this prick helped me to tie the knot.
screenjunkies Yeah so I dont think this is working out for you screen junkies.. The internet is mad at you, real mad
screenjunkies What if he just wanted people involved with it I mean seriously .....why not make a video on Matt Damon trying gr
screenjunkies I agree with this in principle. I do not agree to the hypocrisy of your proposed solution. If it were proposed ironically, it would be funny. But, Im pretty sure there is no irony here...
screenjunkies Zach Braff isnt worth 22 million and it doesnt seem like you know anything about making decent movies. Let people back the things they want to see. Why are you taking away from him for trying to do the things he wants? Also, his appearance on kickstarter put 500000 into unrelated projects and brought 40,000 people to the site. So why is this bad? Why so bitter?
screenjunkies Sizzyrup fueled twerk parties... I want all parts of that!
screenjunkies I subscribed, just so i could have the pleasure of UNsubscribing.
screenjunkies Should I eat the cuttlefish and asparagus, or the vanilla paste?
screenjunkies Team America. I guess my mom rented it because she thought: Oh puppets! Yeah, not too sure a 7 year old should have been exposed to that movie.
screenjunkies Mom! Youre missing the best part. Jeeez :D
screenjunkies what the fuck. the comments you make to your mum are so uncomfortable.
screenjunkies I imagine this movie was awkward to film
screenjunkies Im going to have nightmares
screenjunkies i would fuck his fat bitch of a mom cum in her then pull out and wipe my cum soaked dick over his anonying rat face
screenjunkies I wasnt crazy about Pacific Rim. The action was EPIC, but the story just wasnt interesting to me...
screenjunkies I WANNA GET CHOCOLATE WASTED!!
screenjunkies Whoa, my faith in you disappeared when you said that Star Trek isnt a popular franchise.
screenjunkies Pacific rim? What does that mean? You no like pasific rim?
screenjunkies results show! bring everyone back. are they that busy!
screenjunkies And no one said anything about despicable me 2......
screenjunkies Fuck Iron Man 3!!!!! The worst superhero film of 2013
screenjunkies Grown ups 2 was also good wtf
screenjunkies The lone ranger......
screenjunkies The Devon guy is a fucking idiot... I couldnt handle him
screenjunkies .....wow...just......wow.
screenjunkies I would stalk Bruce Lee if I ever met him. But I can go with Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Donnie Yen, and Tony Jaa...and I would talk about Bruce Lee with them. Hey Jackie, so you and Bruce.. Jet Li...so Bruce... Donnie...So Bruce is your... Tony Jaa...What do you think of Bruce?
screenjunkies Mark Wahlberg ,,, I would most likely talk about how awesome (The Rock) is!
screenjunkies So this was one of the featured pages on youtube and just because of this video i wont watch another screen junkies video. ha u guys suck!
screenjunkies mark walburg just wanted to leave
screenjunkies Hal Rudnick and Nick Mundy
screenjunkies If I could meet anyone it would be Stan leer or peter Jackson and what Id ask them is if they could take some selfies with me (although that wouldnt really be a SELFie)
screenjunkies I have never cringed at an interview more then I did with this one. 1010
screenjunkies alan kkkk chorei de rir em 0:37
screenjunkies ento pronto j q  livre, pra mim esse trailer ai ficou uma super bosta!
screenjunkies Previously on amcs the walking dead, o cara falou igualzinho kkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies Caio na gargalhada nessa parte tambm! kkkk
screenjunkies quem vai ver da joinha
screenjunkies If you cant follow the simplified version (i.e. the TV series) ... then I wouldnt recommend the books. But, if you can then the books are awesome.
screenjunkies i hate tht entire fkn show...
screenjunkies Favourite is Joffrey and worst is Tyrion... Wtf... Something is wrong with me...
screenjunkies Favourite: Daenerys, Tyrion, Jon Snow, and Arya HateDislike: Jeoffrey, Ramsay, and StannisWhat a great show :D
screenjunkies Coolest: Tyrionmost annoying: Joffreymost hated: Cerseihotest: margery
screenjunkies Sir Bangshersisteralot xD
screenjunkies Favorite characters: Tyrion, Ned Stark, Jon Snow, Arya Stark, faceless assassinHated: Joffrey, Theon Greyjoy
screenjunkies can we pick dead characters? because my friends say im like the living Eddard Stark and he kicks ass!
screenjunkies his semen made a demon.................
screenjunkies ferris buellers day off
screenjunkies kingpin fest now! NOW GODDAMIT, NOW!!
screenjunkies Game of thrones,whenever someone gets raped drink a beer,oh wait you would be dead after an episode...
screenjunkies What cocktail? Simple, THE BLOOD OF MY FALLEN ENEMIES!
screenjunkies So whose blood was that?
screenjunkies Stuck at home drinking alone? Add some entertainment with a drinking game and a popular TV series.
screenjunkies My college roommate and I would make what we called Dharma Initiatives and watch Lost. They were coconut rum with peach mango v8 splash and lemon lime pop. Basically whatever we had in our fridge that we needed to get rid of and would be all right in a drink. And.. Stay out of my territory!
screenjunkies supernatural drinking game every time sam says get this or theres blood take a shot
screenjunkies Any News program  Drink whenever they mention something thats supposed to make you terrified, but which has less chance of actually affecting you than butterfly farts. The Drink  Perspective, 1 part Everclear, 1000 parts anything else.
screenjunkies Every time someone on the history channel says as ancient alien theorists believe .
screenjunkies I LOVE GAME OF THRONES!
screenjunkies You think this is the worst thing this chucklehead is doing in D.C.?
screenjunkies My fav Star Treck character was totally luke
screenjunkies You are the nerdiest thing I have ever seen how can you refuse to watch Doctor Who? I frequently sit through the extended versions of all three LotR movies in a row. I have seen the star wars moves so many times that i know the lines better then the actors an yet i cant stand star trek. How do you watch what is basically star wars, but not as cool, and reject Doctor Who, the best nerd show ever.
screenjunkies Whether you be a Star Wars or Star Trek fan, space day would be perfect for everyone.
screenjunkies Dear Barack Obama....I hope you enjoy this as much as I did, and as the host of the video suggests:May the Force make you live long and prosper :)
screenjunkies Halo day n us celebrate by tbags on ur face
screenjunkies Fanfic doesnt count bro.
screenjunkies The British Office is definitely better! Its nice to see someone else think so too.
screenjunkies I guess he made up for it with the DFTBA thing
screenjunkies Say I just wanted to piss you of before I kill you
screenjunkies how can u fuck without blood circulation ?????
screenjunkies Check out my twilight vampire facts at my channel
screenjunkies Holy shit. I just realized that the evil vampire of the Vatican is Masters from Masters of Sex...I feel like crying now.sniffle I love Masters.
screenjunkies Twilight is so fucking dumb.
screenjunkies Soooooo intense !!!!! those stares douhhhh
screenjunkies This movie is so NASTY, that it made look its parody Vampires Suck like a master piece of art, at least the cast was way better looking and more realistic that this Huge piece of shit.
screenjunkies TAYLOR SWIFT! ROFL! XD
screenjunkies you forgot the part in breaking dawn part two when alice was walking across the feild she shared at everyone while doing this that bust be at least another whole minute of sharing
screenjunkies No one blinks in this movie!! OO LOL!! XD
screenjunkies I did the math. Total run time of all 5 movies is 608 minutes. 24m 37s is 4 of the saga.
screenjunkies Are really all the movie makers afraid to tell her to close her mouth or does she have a problem
screenjunkies WTF is wrong with her hand at 1:27?
screenjunkies And scene! Totally nailed it
screenjunkies I think that is actually good up to 6:36 remove the parts that dont have romance and the sparkle scene, and you have a sweet little boymeetsgirl, boydumpsgirl film. (No vampires, no weird noises, no plot holes, no love triangles.)
screenjunkies How much can a humans sanity take??
screenjunkies huffff ! kenapa di Indonesia banyak sekali aturan yg g msuk akal, pdahal film ini bgus bgt  banyak yg suka.
screenjunkies Itd be awesome if Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel hosted that shit
screenjunkies Barbra Walters? Please tell me I missed a joke there...since thats obviously Barbra Steisand...
screenjunkies Ted was joking?? :D :D :D
screenjunkies Why werent Paul Rudd  Melissa McCarthy up for Most Awkward Award while presenting Best Animated Film?
screenjunkies Wolverine sings?! :p Why oh why did you not mention Charlize Theron and Naomi Watts look when McFarlane was singing We saw your boobs?!?!?! Priceless looks! I believe that Robert Donwey Jr with Emma Stone... maybe?
screenjunkies Fuck you ...live with it !
screenjunkies Indeed, Travolta got it all wrong. I cant believe 49 people upvoted someone who clearly has no idea about what hes talking about..oh wait, this is the internet.
screenjunkies THE LAST AIRBENDER YES
screenjunkies I kinda agree with Alison. Make a better Deadpool! Give him his costume, his guns, katanas and his sense of humor! I know it could be potentially weird seeing as he would be entirely different from the other one but since he has a tendency to break the 4th wall he could just be like: Well, they completely fucked me up in Xmen Origins Wolverine so they brought me back! New and improved! Happy now nerds?
screenjunkies My favorite XMEN character is Jean GreyThe Phoenix. The movie did a terrible job on her storyline DreamKiller
screenjunkies I want to see spiderman and the avengers fight the colecter and thanos
screenjunkies THAT WAS DEADPOOL?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! D8 D8 D8 D8
screenjunkies Marvel vs Capcom  The Movie
screenjunkies if a Star Destroyer flies in at the end of Avengers 2, i will be cracking up :
screenjunkies Iron man and batman LOL batman would be all serious and tony stark would be like HELL YEAHHH!
screenjunkies Question: How does Magneto bend Wolverines adamantium claws if adamantium doesnt bend? Is it because Magneto is too strong or because adamantium CAN be bent if the force is strong enough?
screenjunkies okay okay okay....where are the REAL girls from craigslist. the fat ugly and insane ones?
screenjunkies I love how the Terminator question just blew her fucking mind. Only a man like Cameron could sell that idea to a studio and get a few million dollars for it.
screenjunkies To quote cracked: spidermam, and the mother from iron giant (she deserves a nice guy)
screenjunkies Honest Trailers  Eraserhead
screenjunkies AWW eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, loved it xP
screenjunkies Are you sure that Ali isnt just Mila Kunis changing her name for the video to lead you to believe shes a real person with a real opinion and not just a real actress with a real opinion?
screenjunkies 3:40 this bitch needs to not live anymore! Like go away, no oxygen to the lungs.
screenjunkies I love eating twizzler.
screenjunkies Iron man 3 is the best
screenjunkies Benedict Cumberbatch!!!
screenjunkies best halftime show? hmmmm....Manti Teo doing acting out his heartache in mime. the part of his George Glass girlfriend played by a (just as dead) Lorene Yarnell.
screenjunkies Best half time show ever would be the Epic Voice saying various phrases (like he should be doing at the end of the Screen Junkies Show)
screenjunkies Agree! Also Micheal Jackson and Prince put on awesome Halftime shows!
screenjunkies How did I miss this episode? I have no idea. Luckily they had a link on their new Honest Trailer.
screenjunkies Spok and darth vader in concert
screenjunkies Identity thief sucked
screenjunkies Woah, Wiccans are real? Why, I thought that was a fairy tale! ...but in all seriousness, thats a thing?
screenjunkies witches my a, but i would let em polish my firebolt... ok not the one on the right.
screenjunkies These witch people are total freaks.
screenjunkies I love how he just waste peoples time and never takes it seriously.
screenjunkies Alice the slayer of cards
screenjunkies I support any religion that doesnt promote willfully evil acts. I dont know that much about Wicca but I dont think Ive heard any credible bad things about them. There are bad people in every demographic, I think anyone who considers themselves a good person needs to realize that otherwise youre just part of the problem.
screenjunkies wtf the parking spell she just tells in Greek and not ancient Greek or latin normal new Greek : god pls give me a parking spot
screenjunkies really these girls think they can cast spells wow just wow , just wow, wow
screenjunkies The ginger one sat on the left looks like shes a lot of fun to hang out with.
screenjunkies I cant tell if thats actually a real brain hes eating...
screenjunkies The romantic zombie comedy Warm Bodies devoured the box office competition this weekend
screenjunkies Always with m134 mini gun or AA 12 or SW 500 MAGNUM. or if not ketana to the head chain saw works too spiki bassboll bat nail dynemit.
screenjunkies Ninja stars... Nuff said
screenjunkies Best way to kill a zombie is to drop a paino on its head. Old school but effective.
screenjunkies Congrats on (deservedly) making it on the DVD!
screenjunkies burn all the zombies!
screenjunkies The best way to kill a zombie is obviously making them watch Warm Bodies. (a.k.a. Twilight with Zombies.)
screenjunkies I was gonna say Human Centipede, but it looks like you beat me to it.
screenjunkies Im not rashish, Im not prejudish. X D
screenjunkies Windu killed Jango because he put his brothers name to shame.
screenjunkies Is that place as crazy as Hollywood and the music industry would have us believe?Youve got some baws (not a typo) on you Mr Rudnik.
screenjunkies 1:48 did he say Aronold Swarzanigger?
screenjunkies Titanic action figures complete with their own sinking ship. lol
screenjunkies Sex in the City STD detection kit
screenjunkies Id buy a Human Centipede action figure. How could I resist?
screenjunkies Cloud Atlas was one of the worst movies I have ever seen!
screenjunkies The Oogieloves in Big Balloon Adventure was mentioned as a nominee but never talked about. Why did your directors or writers or ANYONE not give you a tap on the shoulder? Does anyone review these videos before they get posted?Also, there was no structure to this. It could have been a real discussion, THAT would have been enjoyable to watch. That doesnt mean it cant be funny, but all this was was random smartass remarks and complaining.
screenjunkies I would rather have Nick Mundy host Screen Junkies, hes funny even though hes always shouting.
screenjunkies Well deserved Razzie, screen junkies, well deserved.
screenjunkies I can not keep watching your show and continue holding this in. You look like Joe Rogan. That MMA announcer guy dude, that looks like he is a fighter, but is really a comedian? Battle Ship was brutal, but man was it bad, but not so brutal as watching G.I Joe 2. The guy with one leg was the best actor in the Battle Ship movie, and he was not even a trained actor i think?Thousand words was bad but it had a point and something of a plot.  Yeah, Tyler Perry was really bad in that action movie. lets not see him in another action flick. Barbara Streisand was the worst performance of them all.  No one pays attention to Q.T. and his little roles in his movies. They are so bad we enjoy them.
screenjunkies Nick Mundy should win one for being loud and lame. Hes like Chris Farley only not funny in any way.
screenjunkies Thank you Michael Barryte for mentioning Amazing Spiderman. Ughhhh that movie.
screenjunkies Razzies are not the only award shows that show the worst in film.
screenjunkies 2013 RAZZIE Nominations: Worst in Movies! 2013 RAZZIE Nominations: Worst in Movies!

screenjunkies Do 40s really taste that good?
screenjunkies She way way too eager to wax you. Kinda creepy. You should have a whos hairier contest with Robin Williams.
screenjunkies youve got sexy legs :D
screenjunkies I left a comment. Now do I get a shirt?
screenjunkies True. I can wash, but Ill never be clean.

screenjunkies Johnny Depp couldnt play any Super Hero
screenjunkies The Grinch, he talks too drunkly
screenjunkies If Superman actually existed, I bet thousands of women would be dying to send him nude pictures.
screenjunkies If Superman actually existed, I bet thousands of women would be dying to send him nude pictures.
screenjunkies Superman is unnaturally creepy.
screenjunkies If they dont fuck, I dont bring em down
screenjunkies Another funny Jewish holiday movie is Hebrew Hammer. Of course it was just a comedy central original movie but it was okay. As for why Superman is being arrested, because his movie sucks?
screenjunkies Im a jew and this guy is also jewish
screenjunkies Good idea, terrible jokes, direction, acting. Sell the idea to Sacha Baron Cohen and he will make it as it should be
screenjunkies Jewish Elf  Official Trailer
screenjunkies Hilarious, you should make this!!!!

screenjunkies Am I the only one who likes Hal
screenjunkies These cant go any furher.
screenjunkies Yeah, we should stop, youre rich.
screenjunkies Why??? Why did you have to show us that dog thing?? Why????
screenjunkies What are with these mean jokes? They are like blind jokes, I just dont see the point...
screenjunkies Because a guy with 69 in his name said so.
screenjunkies Lol wat u reaching for
screenjunkies This is why my daughter will be delivered in a room full of computer hardware. Im not going to have a weakminded trendfollowing sheep of a girl. I will bring her up in such a way that she will be able to build a computer before she can stand and configure a RAID before she can talk properly, simply for the purpose of preventing her from turning out like these girls.
screenjunkies Edward took a deep breath I thought vampires didnt breathe? lololol
screenjunkies YAY!!!!! Aww!!! This is sooo precious! 3
screenjunkies These American kids are so annoying! I already want to kill them.
screenjunkies Its always pretty hilarious when super and I mean SUPER fans of something assume that only ignorant fools dont know what they view as common knowledge. No being malicious here REALLY but I legit laugh. I mean if I asked them questions about my MOST GLORIOUS hobby and infinite bottomless pit of time consumption Warhammer 40k, how much would they know? What are 3 methods of highlighting a model? What material should a detail brush be made of? Difference between gloss and matt varnish.EDIT: They are die hard fans yet one apparently doesnt even know their REALLY recent franchises start date. My god.
screenjunkies Please... these kids havnt even read the books. its in the beginning! FUCK U!
screenjunkies 8:12 Look at the evils. Hahahahahahaha!
screenjunkies HAHAHAHAHA!!!! This is freaking hilarious. :)
screenjunkies What more could you ask for?......Just about anything.
screenjunkies damn, that cute and inocent snow white just awakened my darkest fantasies.
screenjunkies I came up with a drinking game for Ancient Aliens, basically you take a shot every time Ancient Astronaut Theorists is spoken but after the fist five minutes everyone got alcohol poisoning lol
screenjunkies The Farce is Strong in This OneI think Miss Piggy, also Disney now, should audition as Princess Leia. starwars muppets bacon disney
screenjunkies loved it! laughed so hard! thx
screenjunkies The joke would have been ruined by actually nudity considering the Youtube avg demographic... or thats my guess
screenjunkies Goofy should have done the goofy falling call. :P
screenjunkies I would watch the whole Star Was saga with Sebastian as everyone.
screenjunkies Found chef cartman Kyle but not kenny
screenjunkies How can nobody suggest a complete star wars reboot. Sure the original trilogy was good for its time (30yrs ago), but honestly, had the original trilogy been made made now instead of way back then, thered be no big whoop. Way better than some of this crap coming out in theaters but it wouldnt be 110 as sacred as they are now.
screenjunkies That wasnt a prank.That was you being dicks.
screenjunkies you know, your a funny guy but lots of your earlier stuff sucks
screenjunkies You will vote for Mitt Romney.... Hilarious!

screenjunkies you killed kenny you bastards
screenjunkies That voice is a dog! :P lol
screenjunkies My latest silliness.... Fun indeed  though I hope they dont take away my authentic medium card over this. hehe! Enjoy life peeps  dont take it tooo serioulsy! Though I do admit, that the real ghosts and spirits at my house were utterly confused by this whole thing! o) But I explained, now they are Screen Junkie fans too!
screenjunkies I love this and it almost sounded like a dog barking
screenjunkies I think it was saying asshole asshole
screenjunkies Lol that MJ lookalike was really creepy and had a really really giant nose.
screenjunkies I think the voice was Lassie calling from the great beyond.
screenjunkies read my mind, shit every subscribers mind
screenjunkies The voice is a barking dog and thats aircraft lights (or possibly emergency service lights)... Maybe this should have been an alien video instead. That way, you could say it was a UFO and some form of alien speech or a dog thats been modified.
screenjunkies OMG fat sassy southerners. Whatever shall we do??
screenjunkies I hope you burnt that couch!
screenjunkies Seems like you have been eating to much butterd scetti.
screenjunkies As a Walken fan, I found this to be a disgrace to Christopher Walken.
screenjunkies You said it, Super Kami Guru.
screenjunkies I mean hell, I didnt quite know him, then I suddenly realised I was looking at Max Shreck from Batman. Im a teenager and I know who he is... and she doesnt...
screenjunkies Canada gave us justin bieber. We gave them honey booboo
screenjunkies Nod, I absolutely had to quit TV though. It made me FEEL stupid to watch commercials. Physically. Ever since switching to Netflix I feel a lot better about things in general and I dont feel the need to buy everything. I really want Game of Thrones on Net though. I keep hearing how awesome it is. Maybe Ill read the books to hold me up.
screenjunkies Its funny because the new voice actor for the honest trailers can do a better christopher walken impersonation that christopher walken can!
screenjunkies I dont watch Here Comes Honey Boo Boo but Ill watch ChristopherWalken Reads Honey Boo Boo dialogue. This
screenjunkies Not sure if even Christopher Walken could persuade me to watch Honey Boo Boo
screenjunkies SorryChristopher Walken Reads Honey Boo Boo!
screenjunkies I made this for dinner today, and it really is delicious. Very easy to make and I added grilled chicken and a side of salad. I will be making this more often. Thanks.

screenjunkies O personagem que aparece nos creditos  o Thanos que  imortal por ter sido amaldioado pela morte. No precisa fingir que conhece, ele  conhecido sim por quem entende de quadrinhos. Ele provavelmente ser o vilo do vingadores 2, ele  to forte que ele alm do hulk nos quadrinhos levanta o martelo do thor na marra.

screenjunkies If DISNEY had made the new Joseph GordonLevitt  Bruce Willis movie, LooperDisneys Looper (1994 Trailer)
screenjunkies Bet Pedobear and forever alone guy agrees with you completely.
screenjunkies Its mostly taken from the Bruce Willis movie The Kid with Joseph Gordon Levitt footage spliced in. The Kid, wasnt really that good. Maybe It would have been better if Levitt had actually played the younger Bruce Willis.
screenjunkies Great Scot we have to send Bruce Willis of now today to himself in the past!
screenjunkies Turns out your best friends is you. Story of my life.
screenjunkies Yes, thats exactly what I said only for all 3 films.
screenjunkies this should be a top comment. i cant be the only one asking this.
screenjunkies I like nonfiction.Whats your favorite movie?Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2. (Because thats definitely not nonfiction)
screenjunkies All of them. I hated each one more and more every second.
screenjunkies The little girl said I like nonfiction and than she said I like the Beverley hill chowawaw that is fake fiction people talking dogsAre fake
screenjunkies Oh sure of course you make the black girl Black Widow
screenjunkies I hated that annoying little girl
screenjunkies the movie was terrible. should have killed loki, but the writers realized he was the best character
screenjunkies the little girl pissed me off, well honestly the rest of them just didnt know how to argue their points, that also pissed me off but realy the dog movie?
screenjunkies Loki got one blast from Iron Man and almost shat his pants. This movie needed a real villain not that gay Loki
screenjunkies Man no one NEEDS to defend the avengers. Its clearly feckin great. I thought this was an actual discussion but its just this clown projecting his blind geek devotion onto these poor people who obviously arent into marvel at all. What we really need is some actual criticism of this plotless, halfscripted mess of awesome.
screenjunkies thats the cool thing abut the avengers or the justice league
screenjunkies Flula is FCKING AWESOME.
screenjunkies Another remix by celebrity remix by dj flula
screenjunkies subscribed, man. this channel is awesome
screenjunkies a friend of a friend told me about this video. i am liking it.

screenjunkies aburtch Flula and Ali G are two different people.
screenjunkies I want his cat laser eyes shirt.
screenjunkies he could be, Eric is an odd individual on his own. Its not like mushrooms suck the personality of the person right out of them, would kind of ruin the point.
screenjunkies im so badass i do harmless drugs im REAL and also tough
screenjunkies aberg07 LOL dumbass no u werent
screenjunkies Eric sounds exactly like the mini golf clown from Happy Gilmore at the end.
screenjunkies seriously, the intro sounds loud, and then the interview is silent
screenjunkies That was my uncle Buck...sorry DandySteps
screenjunkies TheAUBREYURINE Ya blew it.
screenjunkies Thats exactly how you would act if you started tripping after eating your sandwhich. He doesnt know hes on shrooms.
screenjunkies Snuggler could snuggle him back to health.
screenjunkies The music made it very difficult to hear a lot of the words.
screenjunkies you forgot the black knigth from the holy grail :
screenjunkies Glad to see Heathers death from Heathers. Great movie.
screenjunkies Start diggin Trout......wheres that at?
screenjunkies You umm.. made the music louder than most the clips. Nice job.
screenjunkies some titles would help :)
screenjunkies I wont have any famous last words, for I AM INVINCIBLE!!!! XD
screenjunkies the best is dude on the bomb, I would love to go that way. lol your gonna blow up any ways even if you made it a certain distance, why not go on the bomb.
GameSack I love it when the tables get turned and Chris gets to torment Scott. Scott, is truly embrassed by what Chris is typing, he might mot be able to ever ride in the lifts ever again. There needs to be more of these role reversals, its funny when Chris is the butt monkey, but even better when its Scotts turn.
GameSack That was so funny. Poor Scott for having to put up with that.
GameSack omg that was so funny but way too short
GameSack Oh, that was class. LOL.
GameSack Please make this a weekly thing.
GameSack I think acme made the new music.
screenjunkies I have a feeling there were a few more f words in the movie than portrayed in this video.
screenjunkies can u guys make a supercut from all Stan Lees cameos from the Marvel movies? I think itll be really cool
screenjunkies Lol this gave me a headache
screenjunkies I came to hear lods of Fck... when I saw the video was only 2:32 long I knew something was wrong.
screenjunkies Heeeyyy... you tricked us!
screenjunkies Dissapointing. I wanted to hear the 500 f bombs
screenjunkies May you please do an honest tralier on The Rundown please :D
screenjunkies HEY! IS THAT THE MOM IN DIARY OF A WIMPY KID?Ehhhhh.... Helen? yeh yeh Helen!
screenjunkies they forgot to mentio9n seven in the scroll of the films
screenjunkies Before Sunrise. Two philosophical college students falling in love while walking around Vienna. Their lives changed forever by one short day together. The fight scenes, choreographed by Then Wooping are the best of the 90s, hands down.
screenjunkies You should watch The Nymphomaniac Volumes III with your mom.
screenjunkies You should watch A Serbian Film with your mom. My favorite 90s Movie is Star Wars the phantom menapfffskf, sorry, i just couldnt finish writing it! but seriously, my personal best might be Total Recall. Why? well, i dont know, 3 tits?
screenjunkies Terminator 2 and to not forget 12 monkeys!! :D
screenjunkies Oh fuck you fat ass it was a great movie you bitch
screenjunkies Terminator 2 is arguably one of the best sequels ever made.
screenjunkies Watch it with your mom
screenjunkies say it if you can (: : Pad Kid poured curd pulled cold
screenjunkies i think they were try break a record like with south park with sht
screenjunkies for the next one say Who wants chowder?
screenjunkies how i divorced your mother
screenjunkies Say With great power comes great responsibility
screenjunkies Do The Lego Movie!!!!
screenjunkies Since this new Godzilla movie is coming out why not do 1998 Godzilla
screenjunkies Preach on Nick Mundy!
screenjunkies The only thing that should be funny is megatrons sadistic sense of humor. Maybe Starscreams too. They should be like mr blond. A robotic torture scene would be interesting.
screenjunkies only robot with personality was the old Blackbird rustbucket guy, and he died..
screenjunkies I feel like I will allways love Transformers no matter what. I am excited for Transformers 4 because of Mark and FUCKING DINOBOTS!
screenjunkies This guy is funny as hell and his double chin is awesome.
screenjunkies Why dont we have Tarantino recreate the Gobots..
screenjunkies you missed something STOP MAKING EVERYONE TANNED AND SWEATY
screenjunkies How to fix Jurassic Park, please. Also, How to fix Star Wars and how to fix Indiana Jones. Thank you.
screenjunkies You mean Linkin park not Nickel back.What Ive done,New divide and Iridescent appeared in Transformers and the subsequent films Revenge of the Fallen and  Dark of the moon respectively.
screenjunkies Theyre still fucking making bayformers movies? And now theyre going to ruin dinobots as well? And people are still WATCHING them?Well, I guess if the best suggestion for improving them is make it like pacific shit but if it was made by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich then it pretty clearly illustrates what kind of an audience those things have.
screenjunkies Yeah uh... Im gonna stop watching now... I thought I had seen all the movies on here... NO... Dammit...
screenjunkies Anyone know what the music is??
screenjunkies They missed that Donnie is dead
screenjunkies This video is pure evil! Awesome :)
screenjunkies I have seen all this movies haha
screenjunkies What a twist!! Too bad Ive never seen any of these movies ever.
screenjunkies Red wedding was my favorite part!
screenjunkies Actually, Joffrey is a bastard.His parents are Jaime and Cersei, and theyre not married so that makes him a bastard.
screenjunkies But Joffrey IS a bastard though.... his real parents are jaime and cersei
screenjunkies the dick in a box is one of my favorite parts
screenjunkies The Red Wedding was awesome.
screenjunkies OK HAL RUDNICK I DONT UNDERSTAND A FUK OF WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, YOUR (the idiots guide to game of thrones season 12 didnt help a FUCK!!!) AND THIS ONE ITS A LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT...1WHAT DO YOU MAN THAT JOHN SNOW ITS A BASTARD? 2 WHO ARE THE WILDWINGS?

(AND NO, SEASONS 1 AND 2 DOSENT EXPLAINED)MAKE A BETTER IDIOTS GUIDE!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Daenerys should get in touch with Oberyn Martell. Theyre in laws (His sister Elia married her older brother Rhaegar)and he hates the Lanisters!!!
screenjunkies my favorite part is when Khaleesi gets the army and speaks valeryan to te bald guy and kills them all aaahhh could watch that a thousand times over
screenjunkies I just got an ad for Martell cognac...lol
screenjunkies Is it just me or does this guy sound and talk like Duke Nukem.
screenjunkies jeoffrey shall be remembered as the worst king who ever lived
screenjunkies American Horror Story!
screenjunkies Please do Endless love as an honest trailer !
screenjunkies By any BIIIUUUUUUBS necessary!!
screenjunkies Say:I cant say this tom
screenjunkies By any BEWBS necessary!
screenjunkies Im sort of optimistic. I think Michael Bay is far enough away from the film that it wont just be an awful clusterfuck of explosions and CGI, but actually have a little personality to it.
screenjunkies its gonna be bad.. really bad. i mean, an old white guy is gonna juice up and be shredder.. remind you of anyone? ... the horrible green goblin from spider man (2002)id think everyone knows by now that only one or two good movies come out per year.. and those are rarely action movies
screenjunkies I cant say anything about the story...but my god does the CGI look terrible here.
screenjunkies if they say booyakasha imma slap a bitch
screenjunkies GET MEGAN FOX OUT THE MOVIE!! and fix their ugly faces.. i mean i know they are mutants, but i dont wanna be afraid of their faces :(
screenjunkies How about all you haters not watch the movie? All of you whining and complaining about how horrible it will be are better off. Keep watching your cartoons or make your own movie. Am I the only one sick and tired of people whining like little bitches?
screenjunkies megan fox, again?... gee
screenjunkies how can you even wear a TMNT shirt and NOT know the names of the figures??? come on now thats about enough of this interview for me.
screenjunkies The guy from prison break
screenjunkies Hahaha the Winter Spoiler. 1
screenjunkies Can you do Phantom of the Opera andor Love never dies????
screenjunkies Do Captain America : The Winter Spoiler now !!!
screenjunkies dooooooo fight club!!
screenjunkies Do Captain America: The Winter Soldier
screenjunkies Oculus!!!!! Next PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies The winter spoiler lol
screenjunkies Do Captain America The Winter Soldier PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
screenjunkies Pink Flamingos: Divine ate dog poop for real. Also chicken rapeGumo was pretty Fd up to.
screenjunkies Baron Harkonnen fondling a dying sex slave in David Lynchs Dune.
screenjunkies Whod a thunk it, but Rob Reiner directed a scene that did it for me... Misery... Sledgehammer... Ankle.
screenjunkies teletabies jump to the hole scenes and baby sun was fucked up
screenjunkies Lars Von Trier  the Antichrist. The scene where she cuts off her cs
screenjunkies Clock Work Orange anyone?
screenjunkies 3:11 (heavy breathing)
screenjunkies That was terrible. I regret watching this.
screenjunkies IRREVERSIBLE  the scene with the FIRE EXTINGUISHER, thats pretty rank 0o. The Fly 2  dog scene is :(((
screenjunkies Do The RaidThe Raid 2. Who the hell didnt die in those two films?
screenjunkies Frank Millers Sin City
screenjunkies So this means that the Home Alone series is more violent than the Die Hard series.
screenjunkies MORE I dont care which movie just MORE
screenjunkies A good call for honest action would be any 007 movie
screenjunkies How about the dark knight trilogy?
screenjunkies I wonder how a metroid movie would be...
screenjunkies Dark Souls movie. You couldnt have a movie with a more ambiguous story line.
screenjunkies Final Fantasy not mentioned?
screenjunkies the tekken movie was good
screenjunkies God of fucking WARRR, thats a movie that if its done with the right amount of violence and boobs could be like the new 300.
screenjunkies Resident Evil 1 was pretty dope
screenjunkies Halo Forward Unto Dawn was pretty good. Not sure if it was a thing when this was released.
screenjunkies Id love to see Dead Space go to the big screen but its gotta be done right. Stuff will be left out but as long as its true to the story and the effects are John Carpenters The Thing level, thats fine.Im surprised you guys didnt mention the Resident Evil series. That, by far, was the most disappointing video game movie. The source material was right there yet they choose to build a story that in no way relates to the game. I.e. clones, virtual simulations, super powers. Also, the idea of introducing well known characters later rather than from the start was annoying. Casting was unrealistic. Nemesis was really the only awesome thing from the series. That and Jill was fuckin hot! I say we need a reboot, true to the source material.
screenjunkies watching this at school in the silent library and people are staringso hilarious, i cant help but laugh!:D
screenjunkies Do divergent!!! hat wud be amazing!!
screenjunkies Adele Dazeem xD Im dead, that was hilarious.
screenjunkies Can you do shes the man

screenjunkies did anybody see the easter egg at 1:08
screenjunkies Divergent next. Divergent WILL be next

screenjunkies Christopher Walken host.
screenjunkies subbed just from this video, hilarious!
screenjunkies John Travolta should be the next host. I laugh to die every time he says sth wrong. It may makes the oscars funny, who knows? (Just kidding)
screenjunkies CHRISTIAN BALE would be something new!!!
screenjunkies How did they not mention Idina Menzel messing up let it go
screenjunkies Maybe Sarah Silverman or Ellen Page should host it.
screenjunkies Yes!!! Stanly Tucci should host....dressed as Caesar Flickerman
screenjunkies Jimmy Fallon,Robert Downey Jr., Leonardo DiCaprio for spite lol, Peter Dinkladge anyone of those guys would be awesome!
screenjunkies Rudnick, you got alien eyes!
screenjunkies So will there be a how to fix avengers 2?
screenjunkies 80s Arnold was perfect choice for japanese commercials..
screenjunkies The most useless host segments. Seriously, if you had posted those without having host segments for padding, then it would have felt less like AFV. This video eats it.
screenjunkies Kevin Bacon and english network providers
screenjunkies 3:04 that giant head ended up becoming the governor of California
screenjunkies Christian Bale should do a tampon commercial in Russia.
screenjunkies Tommy Lee Jones has a series or fucking legendary Suntorys BOSS coffee drink in Japan. How did you guys miss it?
screenjunkies Omg Nicholas cage lol
screenjunkies Ringo Starr advertising Japanese apple juice
screenjunkies I lost it at Dhalsim XD
screenjunkies Dhalsim ahahahaha lol xD
screenjunkies Whats the name of the tune that starts at 1:55?
screenjunkies and child abuse ahaha
screenjunkies the Scottish part of Greece lmao
screenjunkies I couldnt stop laughing xD
screenjunkies HEY YOU GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies vinny went from iron to wood. interesting.
screenjunkies And still no Black Panther movie smh...
screenjunkies Wheres nova from ultatimite spiderman they did a whole episode about it what happened look it up people it did happen the guardians are novas family
screenjunkies how couldnt you mention that the voice of the racoon is bradley cooper hes the only good actor in the movie
screenjunkies Fuck, I can not wait for this movie.
screenjunkies I was an avid comic book collector in the 1980s and early 90s and I have never heard of Guardians of the Galaxy! News to me. Looks okay though, might go check it out if Ive got to entertain some kids for an afternoon. Really looking forward to XMEN Days of Future Past though, holy moley does that look amazing. What a cast!
screenjunkies How could you not mention that Peter Quill is part alien?!
screenjunkies Honestly, I think this movies going to be a success, but not in the way the Avengers or Iron Man 3 was. I think casting proves the point that this movie is sort of feeling things out for the possibility of adding the Cosmic aspect of the Marvel universe into the Movie format without losing the audience theyve gained over the past few years. Will the movie be good? Probably. Will it be a box office hit like the Avengers? Maybe. Will it introduce the everyday movie goer to the cosmic realm of Marvel Comics? Yes. Thats a good thing.
screenjunkies perfect honest trailer for an overrated movie )
screenjunkies Thank you! I seriously didnt like this movie at all. 90 of the appeal was just the special effects. Oh, and Incompetent Ripley. Bahahahaha
screenjunkies Have you ever thought of doing video game trailers. You should do Call of Duty: Ghosts and say something about Jackie Chan
screenjunkies Starring Buzz Lightyear.
screenjunkies Do Divergent!! Please!! :D
screenjunkies Get ready for 90 minutes of bumping into stuff and the posible ends of catching things.LOL.
screenjunkies Say pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, this is a real word though by the way
screenjunkies do terminator because im batman
retrogametech I took a chance on a Vectrex 2 years back for the same price with the same fault but rewiring the plug did nothing. I spent hours tinkering with the console and ended up hating the thing.
retrogametech Lol, people are so fucking dumb.
retrogametech Glad to see another video my man! I am actually looking at some model 1 sega cds that say they are broken and try to get one to fix up because I have always wanted a model 1 because they looked so awesome to me back in the day.
retrogametech Nice to see you making vids again. Pm me your address again and I will send you something I know you dont have yet (will need repairing ) and its not another mod chip :)
retrogametech Wow the graphics do look so sharp. That is really cool. Thanks for the upload. If you find a controller, I hope its another Ebay junk, so we can get another repair video.
retrogametech wow you did get a steal. I could but dream of getting something like that and the only thing that was wrong was the power plug. D RetroGameTech
retrogametech Thanks for the new video Martin. I really enjoyed it as usual. Right after watching this video, I found a Vectrex in great condition, with two controllers, and six games for 125 on Craigslist in my local area. I offered the guy 140 and picked it up at 1:00 AM in the morning. I have gotten a lot of great deals on used consoles and games, but I think this one is probably my best thus far.
retrogametech awesome  as always :)
retrogametech Oh wow, now that is retro!
retrogametech I wouldve wanted Shadow, myself.
retrogametech Managed to get the whole set of these in poundworld by peering through the holes lol. You can sort of tell what they are.
retrogametech Im trying not to be a Mr KnowItAll, but that is known as Metal Sonic and first appeared in Sonic CD.
retrogametech Finally a new vid glad to see your ok
retrogametech lol I bought two of these...got x2 knuckles
retrogametech Ive got that same green Lite. I really wanted to get a lime GBC back in the day, but my parents wouldnt let me buy one, so I was really excited when Nintendo later came out with a DS that was about the same color. Im thinking of buying a broken black one for the buttons to make it look even more like a GBC.Could you buy it individually in the UK, or did you have to buy a bundle set to get it like we did in America?
retrogametech Always good to see a new video from you!
retrogametech Great to have you back and best of luck with the new job!
retrogametech I wasnt too impressed with the forced google integration myself, but I suppose Ive gotten used to it now. And to give credit to them, the notification bell at the top right is a good was of seeing if there are any replies to comments made.The GBA mod sounds interesting, swapping the screen over and changing out the trigger buttons.I remember a mate having that GBA movie cartridge, or at least a similar unit, must have been back in 02 or 03. That guy always was ahead of the curve, his imported DS was what convinced me to pick on up myself. I got a Japanese DS from a UK seller in January 05, a couple of months before the UK launch.
retrogametech Subbed for your great content, cheers!
retrogametech Ahhh, the old Nokia Ngage.. I was one of the suckers who bought this on release with Tom Raider. Game did play well but boy making calls was just ridiculous.Bought a Xperia Play and for emulators it was a decent little phone.
retrogametech another great vid man ! , you must keep going !.Down here in Nz there is little to no retro market you have inspired me to start one !
retrogametech such a brilliant collection! im soooo jealous! :D
retrogametech Yes! YES! Glad to have ya back, Martin.
retrogametech When you backup your saves and use them on an Emulator you can use cheats vs having to find A working cheating device and codes.
retrogametech Hey man Love your channel! Games, circuitry, bargain finds and more.Why should we watch anything else! : )
retrogametech Was there any games on the flash cart? That would have been an added bonus.
retrogametech Love the videos Martin! Really look forward to watching them :) Also, what was that game you said that didnt work too well on the Flashcard?
retrogametech Where are you? I miss your videos!
retrogametech I have a similar flash cart but its serial port. I find it better than the sd card one I have as it has no slowdown in games and they dont need patching. but its been flashed for ever with a castlevania rom since I dont have serial port any more
retrogametech You could try to look up the VID  PID of the USB Device once its connected (even without drivers) ... it should look something like this : USBVID0403PID6001REV0600 Just try to google some of the numbers the device will show in the settings.
retrogametech OK, ill get searching. I think it IS megabits, its a GBA so bits is most likely.Some good stuff on German site reinerziegler
retrogametech Whats your favourite console
retrogametech i think this is the site http:gbwriter.software.informer.com and how much did u pay for the ez flash?
retrogametech try this: http:store.kitschbent.comproductusb64msmartcardthere are links there
retrogametech I have 2 256MB Flash2Advance cards from years ago but dont have a clue how to copied roms onto them, i completely forgot how to do it :(
retrogametech Whats the gbc one called
retrogametech Ah Strider 2 (or Strider returns in this case) the infamous game that wasnt made by capcom but by US Gold (which is a british company for some reason) for the strider series. :P
retrogametech You cry me.... i hope those games from Hyper Neogeo 64 really soon fixed on MAME.Im really enjoying your videos.A note: Strider 2 sticker from the back is not chinese, is korean. :D
retrogametech Thats Hangul on that box aka Korean
retrogametech I just bought zero mission today. Im so sad I ever sold it in the first place. I always kept fusion because that was my favorite but in all it seems zero mission is the more sought after one.
retrogametech Golden Sun, Golden Sun The lost Age, NeedForSpeedUnderground, Spyro Season Ice, Catz, Pokemon Saphire, Pokemon Mystery dungeon, Ecks Sever II Ballistic :D and for DS check DragonQuest :D
retrogametech You know, (you probably get this a lot) but whenever i see a video from you, whatever it may be, it brightens my day up. i just love your videos, dude. thank you for making them :D
retrogametech DO MORE EBAY PROJECTS!! I love watching them, practically making me want to go out and buy gameboys and stuff to repair! (probably am going to). Just need to do research on systems. Hope you read this
retrogametech my favourite gba games where the castlevania games, especially circle of the moon and aria of sorrow oh and the fzero games, the mario kart and gt advance 12 where also great racing games on the system )
retrogametech Man, I love your videos :D
retrogametech top 20 hidden gems sounds like a really good idea!
retrogametech awesome dude:) def pick some of them up had soo many hours of fun with them! many adult gamers enjoy them too:) i used think they were just for kids but after playing some at my nephews i was blown away at how good they are! i look forward to know if you pick some up in your vids:)
retrogametech The Madagascar Penguins game on GBA is one of the few platformers I ever liked. Theres also the Spyro season of Fire I think it is thats really good.
retrogametech I too use my PS3 just for the exclusives. I use my 360 for any other games.
retrogametech My setup is very simple.Its a GBA...
retrogametech Hello! I was just wondering where you got the tv stand that is in your gaming setup snapshot videos? I am remodeling my house and I wanted to get something like that to display all my game consoles and such. Cheers!
retrogametech I demand more content from you sir!! Wheres our regular pick up vids!? :P
retrogametech Lol Martin if I did that I would have to go to the inlaws house as most of my systems are now in boxes ready for my house move :( I will try and get it all setup when I move in a few weeks time then if I get chance ill do a video.
retrogametech The dev stuff can really reach crazy prices sometimes. I passed up on a faulty Katana for about 100 a few years back and have regretted it ever since!
retrogametech Damn that sucks, I only got mine because of a lucky windfall.
retrogametech Awesome video as usual, never get bored of watching your great setup man!
retrogametech I wish I had something obscure. I think the most obscure thing I have is MK1 Sega Saturn control pad. Whats so obscure about it? NOTHING, that is how unobscure my collection is.
retrogametech NGage Sega Rally will be on that list!
retrogametech i really wanted the dream eye and i found it for about 25 on ebay but last minute it was taken buy some ahole that bid 50 on it!!
retrogametech I remember when the Retro Lancer was selling cheap on Play.com, kicking myself that I didnt buy one now.
retrogametech Haha, if I had the space I think it would get wall mounted along with the Portal gun :) .
retrogametech dont know whats wrong but i couldnt Finnish watching this because of a very high pitched whistle noise
retrogametech Do you collect old PC games?
retrogametech I have almost no idea what you talk about, but watching the before and afters of your ebay junk series is so interesting. Your voice is just so calming.
retrogametech They just didnt release enough games for the platform before SNK stopped making it. Plus it wasnt a universal form factor . You needed to buy different modes of motherboard for different games.
retrogametech If youre interested in playing these old arcade boards then the best thing to do is Google how to build a supergun. Or if you dont fancy building your own you can buy premade devices on ebay.
retrogametech I dont know much about what consoles you have, but do you have a full Neo Geo arcade cabinet? And if not, would you like to have one, or does it take too much space in?
retrogametech Its the Neo Geo I like, always have, even though I cant really afford it still. The NG64 never held any interest for me let alone I never see any games for it on eBay so why should I bother? Reminds me too much of the N64 too which I would like to avoid lol. I have the one I want, just wish it wasnt so exposed and fragile, but that is my fault for not waiting, oh well.
retrogametech Boom! Just bought one :)
retrogametech It is an interesting piece of arcade harware to have. Maybe it wasnt successful because they spent more money on the metal housings than they did developing the games )
retrogametech Thats the kind of wash I give to all old controllers. Consoles not always, but controllers are always very filthy. Excellent repair video as always!
retrogametech Yeah the GTA5 HDD install texture issues were acknowledged by Rockstar themselves. On 360  PS3 you have to install about 8GB of data, and then on both systems they read from the disc  the HDD simultaneously. Its essentially to make the most of the now ageing hardware, to increase draw distance and for most part remove loading screens. But if you install 360 play disc it causes issues as its trying to read from HDD twice. Im about 12 way through the main missions and about 22hrs logged so far
retrogametech You have to be careful with the rubber parts. I myself use cotton swabs to dig out all the grub because i made that mistake with an NES Controller.
retrogametech DO U HAVE A VIDEO ON HOW TO WORK ON PS3 CONTROLLERS?
retrogametech Nintendo might do something. You should contact them first, for troubleshooting and warranty.
retrogametech Yeah another Lets Repair! I find these vids very relaxing to watch. Thank you! How is your MVS Project progressing?
retrogametech Ebay and hardware stores should have everything you need for these types of job.
retrogametech what wat soldering iron is that and what solder do you use or microsoft uses thank your for your time?
retrogametech Sweet russian sega system clone. That does not look to bad.iv seen some crapy sega clones before. Were did u get that wireless sega contorler at?
retrogametech Would love to see someone attempt to clone a 32x, or even make a Neptune.
retrogametech Timbeeeeeeerrr!!!!!!!! :D
retrogametech Interesting! I didnt know they made Genesis clones!
retrogametech In Russia mega drive x plays you!
retrogametech Are you subscribed because on my account the video popped up in What to watch and My Subscriptions.
retrogametech I might take some photos and add them to the description for anyone whod like to read or translate the box and manual. Thanks for watching!
retrogametech Yeah, the AtGames consoles are notoriously bad for getting the sound wrong.
retrogametech I really enjoy your videos. Also your skills with doing everything one handed is pretty impressive.
retrogametech Was you grounded when playing with the sata hard drive ? I allways make sure I have my anti static wrist strap on
retrogametech well boys get your spears and pitchforks ready for his smb3
retrogametech It really depends on how many collectors are looking for them when you sell. Typically Id expect them to sell for about 10 each. 3 is a bargain.
retrogametech Thanks, glad it didnt put ya to sleep! haha
retrogametech are you going to be making a GBA games collection video sometime soon?
retrogametech Yeah that really does sound a bit weird! lol
retrogametech Excellent find and nicely salvaged! I wanted to message you but I noticed that I cant. Should I just post my query in the comments instead? Thats if you dont mind either way of course.
retrogametech I checked for a new video a few hours ago, and now you upload one, hehe.
retrogametech That game looks like so much fun!! Ill have to get it!! Also good score on the Sky plus box, I wish mine was sitting on the dustbin for you to take its such a slow and clunky box compared to the older Sky boxes no wonder they threw it out :D The free hard drive is certainly the best part! Not used a dock with IDE built in before, looks great!
retrogametech 99p for ICO!!!!! dies
retrogametech What will be your next faulty pickup.
retrogametech No problem! :D I love your videos (and your accent :D). Im almost tempted to send a Game Gear to you to see what you can do about the screen, but sending it might be too much trouble unfortunately. :( Anyway, you have a gift. :D
retrogametech It does look a bit odd, haha. Kinda reminds me of a custom aftermarket shell or something.
retrogametech If you ever find an NTSC copy let me know! :)
retrogametech I thought the same when I saw it on the shelf for 99p. Then I saw the buy one get one sticker... yoink! :P
retrogametech Its brilliant! One of the best on DS. The PSP version is slightly better but overall its a great game. :)
retrogametech Personally I cant stand it, haha. Thanks, though!
retrogametech that GB transferer i want to buy it ....
retrogametech Where did you get this SP? Im amazed youve found one in such mint condition, and an Aussie one at that. Im pretty sure I remember seeing these in Aus when I was younger.
retrogametech Hey Martin, do you know a good place to buy a AGS101 model besides ebay?
retrogametech I had one of those before the ds, not only that my mum got my sister one too!
retrogametech i have a backlin 101 model, how much does it go for on ebay?
retrogametech i got two of these, the European surfblue that is.
retrogametech Whats your ebay username?
retrogametech Haha, well someone got a good deal :P
retrogametech learn electronics aswell as soldering and desolder, check out eevblog on youtube for a really good soldering tutorial
retrogametech Nice but you have to work on getting an older TV D
retrogametech The way I see it I got paid 40 for 2 hours work with a Unibios and parts board thrown in for free. :P The parts board will almost certainly be put to good use in future. :)
retrogametech How much do these go for with no damage in fully working condition? I dont mean mint, but just all original parts and no chipped plastic.
retrogametech I wonder if the power light will flicker when the 3DS is low on battery.
retrogametech Same. The 3D effect is serioulsy cool and a very nice little bonus. I think the same effect would work perfectly on arcade ports. Replace that GameBoy border with an arcade cab and it would be great! Just like a CRT with a perspex cover :) Yeah I think an XL would be the better option in all games. Im holding out for a good deal to upgrade :)
retrogametech hey i just got a psp 2000 from ireland and im in the usa i was wondering if theres any advantage to having a pal psp considering i think its import friendly
retrogametech if you read the manual it will tell you on all GB VC games
retrogametech it is definately interesting but i would rather stretch the picture to full screen that make it even smaller, i dont like having these black bars, but yeah thats just me xD
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Great tip,I wonder if nes virtual console games do anything special like GB colour games.
retrogametech Very cool and useful! Good video :D
retrogametech That would be really cool to see! I hope they also release the Virtual Boy games. Its crazy they havent done it already!
retrogametech I really enjoy these videos but I really dont understand any of the technical stuff.. Im such a typical girl lol
retrogametech What!? No love for the 32X? Cosmic Carnage, dude! Haha
retrogametech I wonder why Sonic 3 didnt work?
retrogametech Retrogametech!!! (Sorry, But i dont know your name), you are know about Super Retro trio ???
retrogametech Haha, I suppose. It was fun trying :) Thanks for watching!
retrogametech i cant finish watching its a great video but there is a loud white noise coming some the video. thought i might tell you in case anyone else found it but still great video man
retrogametech Try jiggling it about and turning it off and on again andor bang the tv and kick the PSU. I heard repeated shouting expletives work great too. :)
retrogametech make it hand hend blend why not make hend hand made? then rewand why not potter man harry
retrogametech No More Heroes is a good Wii game, not a quite sure it is a hidden gem but its defiantly worth checking out. I remember buying it for I think 2.50 a few years ago so it should be just as cheap now. I havent played the sequel but Ive heard thats good too.
retrogametech it wasnt as good as the original but was a great game
retrogametech I was exactly the same until just recently. Only had about 7 games for the longest time. Then I realised just how cheap the good games had become! :) Theres a few vids on YouTube highlighting the uncommon mustplay titles if youre looking for ideas. Users Metal Jesus and TVandLust spring to mind. I guess it just depends on what you like.
retrogametech true but a region free option is available via a softmod so we too can enjoy collecting ntsc (if that flaots your boat) :)
retrogametech Try and pick up Disaster Day of Crisis  its really good..and can be picked up for a few quid. another great video
retrogametech Dokapon Kingdom is really good if you can manage to find 3 friends to play with!
retrogametech by the way since u said in one of your videos that you are gonna backlit everything you can, what you think about the new trend backlighting original GBA, I think its kinda overpriced, ill wait a few for a price drop, but its just maybe only one person is offering the kits
retrogametech Nice pickups Martin u gotta get dead space
retrogametech If you are in racing, you should totally buy Trackmania Wii! Its one of the best arcade racers on Wii! :D
retrogametech I have one since just after launch. Cost me  14.99 back then
retrogametech I had no idea this existed... Thats strange. xD
retrogametech The SP has a proprietary headphone jack at the back of the console but the cart has a built in 3.5mm audio jack anyway.
retrogametech I love when shops are desperate to get rid of older hardware! :)
retrogametech Really glad to see you posting more videos! Missed seeing you in my feed! :)
retrogametech That sounds cool! I havent seen one of those before.
retrogametech Well worth 98p, I remember my friend used to have a third party one that could play videos etc.
retrogametech You can find non sdhc cards about. I have some 4GB (fat16) ones. 4GB was the switch over to SDHC. Check out Amazon 5
retrogametech HMV seem to be ditching all their video game stock at the moment so youre not missing out on much. They dont even have new released games these days.
retrogametech Nice Video cover of the system, can you not use the audio out out on the MEGA CD ?
retrogametech Its a weird one for sure. Ive now managed to get it running at 60Hz and built a RGB connector for it :) . Dare I say the video quality is slightly better than the Mega Drive!
retrogametech Love that show back in the day :)
retrogametech You have anything cool you been working on lately? if not... go build some shit.
retrogametech i might be wrong, but i think that the reason it is locked to PAL is a feature of the console as many Tvs back in the 90s where not compatible with 60hz NTSC, the reason for the main oscillator on the board is that the chipset and cpu (68k), sound (z80) will have its own clock divided by the custom Chips, to be compatible with other regions the clock are changed but the final video output will stay at 50hz pal, very clever for a 90s clone, i wonder if the 32x can be made to work?
retrogametech how much cost one of these and where can we find one?
retrogametech I remember watching that episode of Bad Influence! At the time I couldnt understand why you would want to tear apart a cartridge!
retrogametech As always thanks for watching :)
retrogametech Add me as a contact, i cant send you a message :(
retrogametech I was bidding on that aswell lol
retrogametech Bloomin great pick up, you lucky bugger! o)
retrogametech Lol noticed your name right away haha
retrogametech The monkeys at royal mail did a good job with that box!
retrogametech What a bargain! 2 almost (and now fully) working AES for that price is awesome!
retrogametech Hi, Recently i picked up used GBA console. Unfortunately when I turn it on screen is black with white GAME BOY text insted of white background and dark letters, sadly games are also in inverted, negative colors. Tried to strip down console and check ribbon cable, but it seems ok, adjusting potentiometer didnt work either. Any ideas what could be broken?
retrogametech u lucky bastard :D. Ive always wanted a Neo Geo, but they still go for a decent price
retrogametech That was a nice surprise. Will there be a repair video for the other AES?
retrogametech Amazing job. Gonna copycat this.
retrogametech The clean and uniform presentation of your setup makes my eyes tingle with delight. Also the consoles all being black is really cool.
retrogametech I love this behind the TV episode! Maybe its a quirk of retrogamers. Keep them coming!
retrogametech I got a headache just from see ing the mess of wires you got there. Must have been a lot of trouble organizing all that nice job man
retrogametech tried that already thats why i trying to get ahold of him
retrogametech I dont use an SLG in the box but I guess the hardware here is near enough identical. I believe the manufacturers state theres something like a 1ms display lag when running the signal through this scaler. Not enough to be noticeable and personally I cant detect any difference between running it with or without.
retrogametech Can you not put the Dreamcast VGA into the gonbes 8220 scalers input? Or does it only accept CGA resolutions there?
retrogametech Yep had it since 2005 :P
retrogametech Do what you gotta do, buddy. We wont judge you :P
retrogametech This Video is currently unavailable if live in North Wales! I live 250 miles away from fucking Glasgow my farts are audible further than that fucking distance why is youtube unable to make a video available for that distance!
retrogametech Not really but it still looked interesting and my Wii collection is small. 3 games I think.
retrogametech can you send me a link on the scaler and scan line generator?
retrogametech You always seems to get lucky on eBay pickups! some mega cheap stuff there.
retrogametech Not yet but when the next gen of consoles comes I probably will be :)
retrogametech I really like how only Batmans cape is moving on that title screen.
retrogametech No, the menu on all Wiis is white by default. I modded mine when I got it a few years back :) . From what I remember its really easy to do. Theres a file you download and install which switches the colour for you.
retrogametech Thanks. Haha, its a cool little game, you should check it out :)
retrogametech make the old mvs in the wood case and use the new mvs some times
retrogametech Hey Great video! I was wondering if you knew how to make the 3DS battery last longer that what it usually does
retrogametech Wow man, absolutely wonderful!
retrogametech WHOA !! DUDE !! You are amazing ! Great job !
retrogametech EPIC rescue Martin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
retrogametech You should do more of these videos.
retrogametech Amazing work! Are you an experienced electrician or some sort? How did you learn to fix and mod items?
retrogametech damn finally man i actually missed you puttin vids up its been a while you narrate pretty nicely vids are interesting and all... keep puttin them up... you shud fix my original xbox needs a new PSU i guess
retrogametech Wicked, absolutely wicked! I have a dreamcast if your interested lmao
retrogametech Btw there is no need for background music in your vids :) its nice without
retrogametech Probably half and half to be honest, but if I play MS I usually only use the NGCD controller for some reason. Once, if I can ever find one that is, I get a AES controller that will be all I use pretty much.
retrogametech Could you mod the NeoGeo CD controller to work with a Mega Drive?
retrogametech Awesome, heres a request if you can, There is a controller for Wii U you have probaly heard of called the Controller Pro U by inerworks. The Dpad doesnt work so well on alot of them and the reset button isnt big enough, you need a pin to reset it. Can you do a video showing how to fix the dpad if posible and how to make the reset button a bit bigger or easyer to press. It would help ALOT of people including my self. Thank you
retrogametech I wish the PS2 controller was as easy to fix as this. Your main problem here seemed to be a massive accumulation of shite inside the controller and a couple of distorted micro switch discs. A very informative video, good stuff.
retrogametech There is nothing this man cant repair! Great video!
retrogametech When the convex button becomes concave it makes constant contact with the other plate hence registering the button as always on. This repair was first introduced by Xian Xi and can be found on the Jammanationx website. You can use regular microswitches but it requires more work. Nice little fix there Martin
retrogametech Nice, you should do a tutorial where you clean a console or a controller (for example the product that you use, something like that), heres my advice. :)
retrogametech Why didnt you spray it with compressed air?
retrogametech Thats cool, but I personally think it would be complete with the original Ubisoft logo... And used the commodore or something instead of the Sega Megadrive... But yeah, thats me...
retrogametech One of my friends says that blood dragon sucks and that first your trying to survive on a island and then your on some stupid techno island. Fucking kids these days.
retrogametech Thanks. Yeah Id love to see a proper disc release for PS3360 :)
retrogametech Thanks. I have the design for a cart worked out in my head. Just need to get the time to make it :)
retrogametech somebody should make this game a homebrew sidescroller shooter and release it for the genesismegadrive. i remember halo came out for the atari. and angry birds has a homebrew genesis cartridge too.
retrogametech The question remains: Will you go as far as to port this game to the megadrive?
retrogametech did you put it the install on a cd and place it inside?
retrogametech Haha, cool idea! Dont think Id have the skillpatience for that though :P
retrogametech How much did this set you back? If I pick one up myself will you be up for a game of cyberball? :)
retrogametech Good, now add the Karaoke machine and put a 4 controller tap on there and fill all the slots! HAHA! Make the Mega drive suffer!
retrogametech It might just need its capacitors replaced. Its a pretty common fault with GameGears and not too difficult to fix. You can buy kits with all the parts you need online and there are a few tuts on youtube showing you how to do it. Maybe give it a shot yourself and make a project out of it? :P Id like to help but I dont do repairs on anything other than my own stuff these days, sorry. Also, the postage alone would probably cost as much as the console anyway! :P Thanks for watching btw! :)
retrogametech so THATS whats that hole was for!!!!!!
retrogametech awesome vid mate just got a mega drive 1 with the expansion port and was wandering what it was for. now i know :)
retrogametech Great vid, i never knew they done this for the mega drive, thanks for sharing it!!
retrogametech I would if I had one :P
retrogametech Thanks! Glad you enjoyed it :)
retrogametech Been a while since the last vid. Missed you man!!
retrogametech What shop did you get the tv from Martin?
retrogametech Sure is. I thought Id have to live with some of the picture missing.
retrogametech Put the ugly sticker off. Lovely set! :)
retrogametech In any case, im back over in Japan, you after any rare obscure stuff i can keep an eye out for? :)
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech They are definitely great little tellys. Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Wow. Ive got a black one of that exact model haha only difference is i found mine next to a bin with the remote on top lol and it worked!
retrogametech wish scart had picked up in the US, it makes so much more sense then the craziness we got p but we are all mostly HDMI now so I guess we all came together finally.
retrogametech I picked one these Tvs for 4 on a boot sale last year and its great for my gamecube and I use it for coin ops on Xbox and I prefer it to my LCD because these sound has a arcade feel to it. Also never knew about the service menu so thanks for that
retrogametech Most oldschool consoles didnt support true interlaced video  they tricked the video system into displaying ONLY one field of video instead of the normal alternating video (evenodd lines)  resulting in true 60HZ play (and the reason for the warning about projection TVs  which often couldnt handle the increased actual frame rate). This is the normal reason for these black scan lines on many TVs
retrogametech Yeah games like DoA arent as noticeable. I generally turn the scanlines down so they arent as intense for those games. It does however add a little extra depth and the menustext really benefit from it.
retrogametech looks like a great bit of kit. you cant beat some scanlines :)
retrogametech Nice explanation of the SLG3000.. I have one and am really pleased with it. Got it mainly for garou mark of the wolves and sonic CD on the 360 and anything else retro for that matter :) I was also really wanting to use it for PS3 but pal PS3s dont even do a 640x480 signal! the lowest it goes is 576ip (50hz to boot!!) how silly is that? :(
retrogametech Thanks. I actually bought the scaler, SLG and Sync Strike after seeing your vids, haha. I linked to your channel in the description so anyone looking for more in depth explanation can check out your vids. You do a much better job of explaining the technical side of things when it comes to these devices. The console I was really surprised with was the Wii. In a 4:3 ratio at 480p  scanlines it looks great! Games like HOTD Overkill, Mario Kart and A Boy And His Blob seem to benefit nicely.
retrogametech i wouldnt have expected the scan lines to make such a difference on jet set radio
retrogametech Very easy. The scaler isnt needed for the DC, though :)
retrogametech Second, Jokin, Never been this early on A video though.
retrogametech The effect comes across quite well on YouTube. Its encouraging that we will be able to preserve the arcade look long after the CRTs have all died.
retrogametech The sega mega looks like such a load of crap with all that stuff piled on it. I swear its like sega just couldnt stop piling shit on it.
retrogametech pure AWESOME !! I never new that was around for a mega drive! well dine finding it bro! :)
retrogametech Excellent response! I lold. If I gave you my number, would you call me via the MD? :D
retrogametech If I call that number I will have called a number the legendary Megadrive called it will be like a celebrity! I am not going to though!
retrogametech Incredible that you managed to make the Genesis modem work! I cant even manage to get my Dreamcast online for Phantasy Star Online...how can you tell if you have a phone line in your house?
retrogametech Netlink for Saturn still works too. Do you have a Netlink around that you could mess with on camera? Still regret selling it.
retrogametech omg that is the most monstrous Mega Drive ive ever seen! lol
retrogametech That thing is uber rare! haha. One day maybe. Will also need a bigger entertainment unit to store it all :P
retrogametech I do not inow for certin but I live in  and we have over 200 cm this year in certain spots.
retrogametech What if this road was in england it would have potholes everywhere :)
retrogametech Great vid, great road :)
retrogametech Where are the check points lol
retrogametech You should have had Magical SNOW Shower playing on the vid.
retrogametech Haha, good to hear from you, sir! :) I suppose it at least makes a nice change from the constant rain!
retrogametech I might do something like this in future for video responsestalkies etc :)
retrogametech PEI just got hit with a big snowstorm, schools cancelled and everything
retrogametech Holy crap, this is BRILLIANT! I should try this one day.
retrogametech My screen sometimes goes darker sometimes though what is it
retrogametech Im going to start listing all of my values in pesos from now on.
retrogametech If I had your skill...
retrogametech Absolutely love the show, keep up the great work.
retrogametech lmao how did it fall in the sea hahahahaha?
retrogametech Heya, Anyone heard about the Rapid Cash Fortune? (do a Google Search) Ive found out quite a few wonderful stuff about it and my uncle made loads of money with it!
retrogametech Im not sure what you mean by they? The majority of people around the world either use or are familiar with the value of US Dollars in comparison to their native currency. On top of that, over 80 of my viewers are from the US. Only a very small percentage are actually from ScotlandUK. I think it makes a lot of sense to add USD values so everyone can get a better idea of the prices Ive paid.
retrogametech Got to love the new Scottish money :D Us English still have boring money
retrogametech Ashen is easily the best looking game on NGage, looks abit like the original quake.
retrogametech isnt there a Sims game for the ngage?
retrogametech It was definitely a very odd design decision. Im surprised the idea made it past the concept stages let alone into the final product! Maybe it really was a genuine oversight? But how could they miss it!? You effectively had to disassemble half the phone then rebootreset clock and calendar settings every time you wanted to play a new game! lol The QD is nice but they dropped some hardware features like the MP3 player, radio and microphone port. Although screen is biggerbrighter as a bonus :)
retrogametech Collin mcrea rally 2005
retrogametech Very nice milestone  I am missing 7 ( Atari 1  2  civilization  High seize  warhammer  rifts and of course sega rally, I remember when this one was 20 pounds  delivery from AUS but I said pass, now I am regretting it a little)
retrogametech Were you being a complete jerk?
retrogametech grats man Im inspired , maybe Ill try to get full collection of Virtual Boy
retrogametech When Gamestop was closing down here in the UK, they had 3 NGage games all for 1P each. One was that Tomb Raider game, that Diablo style game and something else, i ended up selling them all for 10 each lol. Also Is there any good NGage emulators? I see some about, but because theyre not talked about a lot I dont trust their validity.
retrogametech I love your explanation at the end, there. People ask me why I collect games and keep some of them sealed and they cant understand it. Im trying to achieve a full Sonic PAL CiB collection which is starting to take up a lot of room, but I think itll be worth it in the end. Love your collection and pickup videos reminds me Im not the only one. Haha
retrogametech I did get this controller when i preeordered halo 4 (i could choose between a controller or a headset) and i like it. Its nice to just have it too :D
retrogametech The dpad isnt standard either btw not trying to criticize your video but the default dpads have 2 screws you have to use and look much different than the dpad design with this control where u can simply rotate 90 degrees and pop it out
retrogametech I have the 2 controllers that came with my Halo 4 360, different design and the clear shell is blue instead of grey. Im not too bothered by the analogue sticks in them but Id definitely be interested in getting a replacement sticks for my spare old white controller. They are pretty worn and youve shown its pretty easy to swap out.
retrogametech Nice controller, Ive got a couple of special edition controllers ( street fighter, call of duty etc.) would be great if you made a vid on how to replace the LEDs for blue ones, I trust your guides so I would just follow yours. :)
retrogametech So much simpler than a ps3 controller
retrogametech Hey Martin, would you happen to know if the original XBox controllers use the same thumbsticks as the 360? I have an old XBox controller with some really worn sticks, but while I can find plenty of replacements for the 360, I havent been able to find any specifically for the original XBox.
retrogametech if i wasnt such a lazy bastard i would so learn japanese.. definitely the coolest sounding language on earth.. even if they cant say r  this game really shows what the DC can do.. and it makes most other devs look lazy by comparison.. its a shame the console never had a full lifespan.. i think we would have seen some amazing stuff come out on it.. aaah sega, where did it all go wrong?
retrogametech Wow your VGA hookup is beautiful. I cant wait till I finally get some time to mod mine
retrogametech EVERYTHING IS MY DELUSION!
retrogametech Its a good game but probably not. I find the 3D Sonic games on DC pretty difficult to control!
retrogametech I do have a capture card thing but I dont like using it. I think they give a less personal feel to these type of videos. Theyre also a lot more work to use (extra editing, capturing voice audio, equipment to set up etc).
retrogametech Not sure but the Dreamcast wasnt far off the PS2 in terms of performance. It actually looks a lot better in many circumstances.
retrogametech This was also released on the ps2 a.k.a DOA2 hardcore
retrogametech I live in Ayr and i have to say your town is better :P
retrogametech Dont tell me you buy old cars and refurbish them too. :)
retrogametech Thanks for bringing me to the attention of Power Glove. Their Maximum Potential track with samples from a Dolph Lundgren 80s workout tape is the stuff of awesomeness.
retrogametech What kind of motor you got mate? Sweet video
retrogametech Nicely done, enjoyed that.
retrogametech Was about to ask re the track, but then I read the description :) their music sounds excellent!
retrogametech Fun video, and the music fit the mood really well. I will definitely be looking up Power Glove.
retrogametech Could you do a front light mod tutorial for GB Colo(u)r, please? Ive seen only one other on youtube and Id love to see how you would do it. Itd really help me out!
retrogametech Im curious if something like this would be doable to the Wonderswan. Ill have to get one and try it.
retrogametech Do you have a specific link for this backlight?
retrogametech Whats the best way to clean the adhesive off the back of the screen? I tried cue tips but they left little pieces of fuzz.
retrogametech where did you get the clear gameboy shells?
retrogametech Hi i cant find these backlight kits on ebay? What are they called?
retrogametech I need to know what music you used in this video. It sounds epic.
retrogametech the game image looks a little washed out and faded when lighted is that how it looks in person?
retrogametech Where do you buy your kits? Ive looked everywhere.
retrogametech Tried this mod and ended up destroying the VMU :(
retrogametech it was probably not used for years so Im not sure if with more usage itll stop doing that or if it will get to the point to where it stays like that and ruins the screen. I bought some batteries for it so that way the little icons will light up since a lot of the ink or whatever built up the most around those. Im curious as if it anyone else has ever had that happen. If it keeps happening Ill post a video of it on my channel.
retrogametech With the battery life of a standard VMU, Im surprised your backlit one didnt die just while you were filming the video.
retrogametech Not really youll probably need to install a frontlight in there.
retrogametech Damn, thats pretty sweet.
retrogametech Nice mod have seen this done in a original gameboy or gameboy advance. You have skills with the soldering iron.
retrogametech Are these sell on ebay? I need one badly!
retrogametech Thanks dude. Yeah the music is from a Dreamcast game. Its BGM from DoA2 :) . One of my favorites.
retrogametech Well done, sounded like you surprised yourself on this one. Suppose worst case scenario, you could have kept if for spares or sold it on. Good that you got it working, although your wallet will be lighter when you track down more games for it :)
retrogametech Glad to see you managed to bring our dead console back to life!  Enjoy Dude! Game Sensei
retrogametech Thanks. Fixing a lot of these old systems is generally easier than you might think )
retrogametech yeah i love my jamma modded pc engine ) i bought it from a guy on the german arcadeforum for 110 including gallaga88 and gunhead aka blazing lasers i made an unboxingvideo of it if you wanna check it out, but i still have to upload some gameplayvideos of my new pc enginge games D
retrogametech Id love to get some suggestions of games I should try.  the one you got is one of the best there is for the system. Id also recommend Keith Courage in Alpha Zones (platformer came bundled in some North American releases) and Victory Run (driving).
retrogametech Its not that bad but the PCEngine is a lot nicer looking. The TurboGrafx was made unnecessarily large to cater to western consumers. Bigger is better and all that.
retrogametech Amazing! Lucky it was so easy to fix :D
retrogametech Damn! A TG16 for 11.50 pounds? Thats an epic deal indeed.
retrogametech I got a supergrafx  and still reckon the TG16 is way more ugly than that. The original white PCE was the best looking of the bunch.
retrogametech I love the fact that you stacked all Yu suzuki games together. Seems logic for me
retrogametech Unfortunately I havent been able to get outside to cut wood and paint the last few weeks. So the MVS is still looking a bit naked at the moment. Should be putting it all together soon though :)
retrogametech Great pick ups! One day you should show your entire DoA collection. That bundle PAL DoA2 must be quite rare... How did you spot that Metal Slug was a bootleg?
retrogametech Are you selling any r4 cart for the ds, if not do you recommend any website that does. P.S im for the UK.
retrogametech Some fantastic pick ups there martin. I take it with that metal slug footage you showed us, you have the cmvs almost finished? Cant wait to see it. At least you will have plenty of things to keep you busy when all this snow hits us this weekend.
retrogametech Bargain! they are still around 60 on places like Amazon etc
retrogametech Ive got the bundle copy of Dead or Alive 2, think we got it at some event or something, good game
retrogametech The seller didnt have a picture of the cart in the listing, the auction title was incredibly vague (didnt actually say what game was for sale) and the description, again, extremely vague. The start price was also lower than it really should have been. Seller turned out to be an expub landlord selling off old carts he had kicking about. Legit and friendly guy. I wasnt tricked, I knew it was 5050 to start with.
retrogametech Can you give a tutorial on how to mod the cart to use the parts and where to buy the parts from?
retrogametech I know :( Maybe this guy can make one. The only flashcard that plays 3DS games is GW3DS, and it only works with 4.5.010x!
retrogametech very nice job! can you flash multiple games to those chips? that flash board thingy looks insanely complicated to a noob like me lol
retrogametech 8MB is larger than 32 Mb, i am not sure if mark was referring to megabytes or megabits.
retrogametech I was just wondering if youre still working on this Reproduction cart project. Because if you still are, I may have something that will make them look a little less messy and almost official.
retrogametech Very nice project, Shantae is a realy cool game for the GBC.
retrogametech Your brilliant,I love your videos .I always learn something. Thank you.
retrogametech is there something similar for the snes (Super Nintendo Entertainment System)
retrogametech Would it be possible to make a micro sd slot on the cartridgeand load games onto that so you could have crazy memory for games?
retrogametech Hey mate, just wanted to say that I really admire what you do. Its so fascinating. The time and effort you put into refurbishing collectibles makes me want to do the same. Keep up the great work!
retrogametech Can you fix the screen and clean up my gameboy ? Please!!!!!!
retrogametech Liked and Subscribed. Thank you
retrogametech i dit bought 2 gameboys for 10 euros excluding shipping costs. after i had cleaned them,they work,however by 1 of the gameboys 1 battery connection has been rust,i tryed to remove that rust with sandpaper but it doesnt work. by the other gameboy it does work via batterys but one slight move and the gameboy shuts off. they both work with adaptor. they both are also yellowish.
retrogametech Awesome, didnt know the screen issues were that easy to fix thanks!!!!
retrogametech My friend has two original Nintendo Game Boys. One of them has the same problem with the battery leak. I easily fixed it! His screen cover was also fallen off and I used this one type of adhesive, which I forget...
retrogametech I love your vids. Keep up the good work.
retrogametech what soldering iron do you have?
retrogametech I was drinking IrnBru while i was watching this!
retrogametech Awesome! Ive always wondered if it was OK to ship IRNBRU, so I can send some to my cousins in Canada :D
retrogametech haha, irn bru. you can find that stuff in canada too... it sortof tastes like cream soda.
retrogametech Love Irn Bru, and yeah, it definitely makes for a good hangover cure!
retrogametech Do a vid on the drink luck
retrogametech Be careful, Luke! I had IrnBru when I was in Ireland, and its not going to taste anything like what you might expect (despite the colour, its definitely NOT orange pop)! Heed this warning!
retrogametech Awesome pressie but no Buckfast!? hehe D
retrogametech great video  careful with that IrnBru! Youll know what I mean when you taste it.
retrogametech Its definitely an acquired taste at first. But it actually tastes different depending on what it comes in 750ml glass bottle is the best one.
retrogametech Can you sent me all the thing that retrogametech
retrogametech Its not just the English that use sterling, the whole of the UK does, including Scotland.
retrogametech With the downloading between 11 and 3, does the download have to finish within that time? What if I have slow internet? Will it let the download start and then continue outside that time?
retrogametech To be blunt and perfectly honest, its fucking retarded.
retrogametech I totally agree with you. It feels a bit backwards to restrict times to view trailers, when as you say, the console itself has restrictions in place for this sort of thing any way. Ill never understand Nintendo and their strategies.
retrogametech Im an adult gamer who has a 3DS and a Wii U and Im worried about this. I havent noticed any adult content on my 3DS, so havent had a chance to try it.
retrogametech thats some bullshit right there. its this kind of thing thats making me quite likely to avoid the next gen all together.. nay bother.. itll give me time to catch up on the classics :)
retrogametech Im getting a little sick and fucking tired of this shit. Nintendo isnt the only one, but theyre certainly the biggest peddler of this controlling crap. Parental controls have existed for literally over a decade, whether they be ingame options or console options. What are Nintendo now claiming with this shit? That those parental controls werent suitable, that they didnt serve their task? That parents arent capable of deciding what their own sprogs can watch? Come on people, cut it out!
retrogametech Yeah, I think this is a huge misstep by Nintendo. Its just going to further frustrate some of their audience, and thats really not what they need. Any sort of mandated censorship is bs in my opinion anyway, like that law they tried to pass in the UK about you having to call your internet service provider to enable porn to be viewed.
retrogametech This is a server side restriction. You have no control over it.
retrogametech Already did one a while back :P . Just search YouTube for gba shell replacement. AGS101 and AGS001 have the same form factor so the guide applies to either :) .
retrogametech I was going to bid on that graphite gba sp, but by the time it was one day left it was out of my small crappy budget at the time
retrogametech Craig from tvandlust did a good review of it a couple of years ago... NiBT77gJ0uo
retrogametech Apparently it has been in development for a little while now :)
retrogametech Im getting the subscription glitch were none of your videos are showing up... thanks youtube
retrogametech BTW whats a good price or average price to pay for an AGS 101?
retrogametech would you be interested in an atari jaguar at all?
retrogametech Im trying to mod a cloned MD2. Any idea if it will work?The motherboard is an exact replica of the original. Im not even 100 sure if it is a clone.
retrogametech The CD32X addons will not work with an overclocked megadrive.
retrogametech As I said it was a great video you just mumbled is all. When making videos you have to know when to tell the difference between constructive criticism or bing a troll or an ahole in the comments. I was just giving some constructive criticism. No Big deal delete the comment if you like.
retrogametech I still use the RF out, as i got a cheap megadrive RF to Scart cable. No modding required, 3.45 on Ebay XD not great, but good enough.
retrogametech Top work as always Fella, Ive been thinking about them switches for a long time to use on my project, simple But effective Two thumbs up
retrogametech The rocker switches looks way better. Ive never liked the metal toggle switches on modded consoles either  just looks weird. The sliders are ok, but those rockers switches just fit so well.
retrogametech Dumbarton guy here :) love yer vid makes me wish i could solder better than i can, id love tae dae some of yer wee mods lol one ill find a good vid tut on soldering
retrogametech I prefer the slide switches but youre right the rocker type are much easier to fit. I had a single rocker on my Mega Drive II (which is a bit longer than yours) and my main Saturn is done with slide switches. I managed to pick up a triplepole quadthrow for the Saturn so I have EUUSJP all set via a single slide switch and a second slide switch for 5060hz I did these quite a few years ago now, probably around 10. I am going to do some more simple modding soon and probably put some vids up
retrogametech The Model 1 is the best looking one! Has the best sound too.
retrogametech Not so much these days.
retrogametech Is HDMI not a popular video output over there? RGB SCART cablesconnectors just seem really bulky.
retrogametech damn your videos are full of information keep up the good work.
retrogametech This will look brilliant youre using some quality parts there. RetroSwede has fitted a circular rocker onoff switch on his Supergun and I think it looks great. Im currently consolising an older piece of kit an Amstrad PCW computer from 1985, Im gonna call it a CPCW now :)
retrogametech cant wait to see it in all its glory!
retrogametech lol nice, maybe ill be able to find that game too bad that there are like 40 versions of kof on that card x.X
retrogametech SCART connections seem to be incredibly versatile, I wish it had been adopted in the U.S. MDF takes paint very well, and allows for a nice finish. Youll need to paint your multicart black as well ) I was hoping you would add something to protect the front panel. MDF looks nice when it is painted, but it is not terribly durable. Now I want a CMVS :(
retrogametech monitoring the process...
retrogametech Thanks! Itll be tricky to getting the finish I want but hopefully itll all look good in the end :)
retrogametech Maybe it looks like its orange but its red?
retrogametech OFFICIAL RETROGAMETECH DREAMCAST DISASSEMBLE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP :p please make that happen :D
retrogametech man i love these videos, please never stop!
retrogametech Nice breaking down of the DC. Very informative :)
retrogametech Lol, the AfterBurner theme fit so well!
retrogametech I bet I could probably do it in 3 and a half to 4 :P . Ive fixed so many of these things over the years I honestly could do this blindfolded, haha.
retrogametech Martin, another great video. Thanks for uploading this. And... yes, please, we would love to see a Saturn strip down video made by you. Its great to understand all the components of a console, at the hands of someone else who is more competent in stripping them down. Im always fearful of breaking things when Im venturing into new territory. But after I understand them better, Im already thinking of some great mods to be made.
retrogametech lol i only could imagine seeing you using a powertool on that thing.... bwwwtbwwwtbwwwwt... taking that baby apart in about a minute OO nice job though i always loved the dreamcast for its component design wich allows you to very easily to take it apart or replace something )
retrogametech venga boys vs steps lol. that sounds like the devils music, ozzys sacked ) somehow it works tho.. lol. great find on the infrared controllers. yea they do usually go for a pretty penny. some cool stuff there dude..
retrogametech Im experiencing more or less the same thing so I guess we can rule out our ISPs. It seems worse at peak times. Its probably just YouTubes servers struggling with the demand. Ive given up watching vids at 720p unless its outside peak times or something with high production value. But like you, even 360480p vids will struggle to buffer! Its especially annoying if Im trying to watch or listen to a music vid!! Its like having a scratched CD!! lol
retrogametech I remember way back when, at school. The chav and chavette retards saying my music tape was shit (beasty boys) then later overhearing them discussing how cool the venga bus song was. UGH.
retrogametech Thanks Ed! I might do some waffles in future. I have a few topics Id quite like to discuss so maybe Ill give it a trial run :). I love how the Mega Drive is looking! haha. I just need to track down that japanese modem attachment and the transformation will be complete! What did you think of the Sega collection? I love that Golden Axe remake. And the music in Outrun is cheesy as hell! XD Just need a copy of Sega Rally on Ngage to have a complete worldwide collection. One day!....
retrogametech RetroGameTech Would The Third Party Adapters Work With The Original Controllers?
retrogametech The collection is worth 5 of anyones money for that Golden Axe remake alone! :)
retrogametech I thought it was probably a combination of my ISP (O2) and YouTube messing with their buffering settings. I noticed recently that some videos wont continue bufferingloading in the background if you pause them. It might continue downloading an extra 30sec of video but then stops until you hit play again. I was thinking it was maybe an attempt to curb wasted bandwidth? i.e. people watching half a vid then clicking on something else?
retrogametech Been Watching Since August 2010. Looking Forward To Another 2 Years, Cheers!
retrogametech RGB SCART looks pretty good still even on a HD LCD TV, but dont know what the poster uses himself
retrogametech Where exactly do you buy your replacement parts?
retrogametech Tell me about it :P, I got mine as a birthday present (I have the XL model).
retrogametech I absolutely love you and your content, Cant stop watching !!. Dont know how I didnt find out about you bedore !
retrogametech Thank you, Ill try to make more of these.
retrogametech Wow I cant believe you touched the soldering gun, it really burns (that actually happened to me before when I was trying to replace the joysticks on my Gamecube Controller).
retrogametech Do you by chance know of anyway to fix a 3DS that randomly turns off? There are some suggestions on the internet but none of them worked. I bought it off eBay as a fixer (watching you inspired me to fix stuff and resell them) I took a chance on it being there wasnt any pictures and it was barely touched. I only paid 40 for it so it was pretty cheap. Hoping you have some suggestion if you even read this since the video is pretty old. Anyway keep making videos!
retrogametech well done fix the 3ds ! why dont you keep hold of it and trade it in as part payment for a wii u! :)
retrogametech Thanks! Yeah the XL seems to have a very nice looking screen. :)
retrogametech Great setup mate :D are you from the UK
retrogametech Sweet! You havent had a talk on each system for a while, very nice stuff :) Also check your inbox I made something for you!
retrogametech Im glad Im not the only one with bugger all space.
retrogametech 3 mods. Is your house small? or does your wife not let you have your consoles hooked up everywhere? I know the feeling...I gotta keep all my consoles in their cases and hook em up one at a time because apparently they look ugly.
retrogametech nice work Luke  youre setup actually always reminds me of Super Potato :D even the shelving looks similiar, and the odd few little LCD screens about the place showing games
retrogametech Ha, these two appeared right on top of each other in my feed.
retrogametech Nice setup. Right now Ive got a 2 ps1s, ps2, gamecube, 2 xboxes, 2 xbox 360s and a ps3. Did have an nes, snes, megadrive a few years ago, but some twat broke into my flat and nicked them when I was away one weekend. Got plans to get them all again though.
retrogametech sweet thankyou so much for your help dude, lol naah screw compsite i go all out scart because its so much easier, does it have alot of scart plug sockets in that tv then ? because i will have a lot of scarts to plug in haha ! :) and keep up the great work with the videos man i love them all !! :D
retrogametech Subbed recently, by far my favourite channel, so envious of this setup,
retrogametech yes! please! im such a huge fan and it would be so great!!!
retrogametech Thanks dude! Yeah Shadow Dancer is great! Found that cart on ebay super cheap! :)
retrogametech Time for an update to this video!
retrogametech All my cameras are too crappy to record video but i could send photos. p.
retrogametech Awesome setup! Reaally loved how everything got together in there! And the light show at the end was really cool aswhell!
retrogametech Can you tell me what website you used to buy your R4i Card from I have found a few websites but not sure if they are trustworthy...
retrogametech No way of knowing but mine have a bug where they wont boot unless I set the DS clock to a few years in the past! No faults with my cyclo DS though
retrogametech Im considering that! A game related geocache :)
retrogametech why cant i buy r4s on ebay ?
retrogametech I dont think you can sell them on ebay your lucky, i got 5 of them in there boxes but for the 3ds also so yea ill be selling them at the markets when i go there to sell stuff
retrogametech I find it really difficult to keep on top of PMs. I try and respond to new video comments daily though.
retrogametech In that case would you mind selling me a blank one as you wouldnt be selling any games, just the ability to use them?
retrogametech Whow 8 for all of them? I have 3, 1 4 ds and 2 for 3ds an i spend like 40 on them
retrogametech Wood R4 is the best software for r4. The Acekard2i is great.
retrogametech the musics horrible but this is still pretty neat :)
retrogametech that music is amazing i want to download it extended version on mp3
retrogametech (Please respond!) Where can I get this actual cartridge?
retrogametech Ive played this game. I remember discovering a glitch in the game when I can go to the left and somehow Sonic would appear at the right side of the screen and then the game glitches out making Sonic walk on an Invisible path.
retrogametech Now I know who bidded over me. D:
retrogametech Its the MD everywhere except North America. They had to change the name in North America because of trademarklegal issues.
retrogametech Only thing missing is the blast processing and you wouldnt be able to tell this from the Genesis version :)
retrogametech Its damn awful, sounds like a child composed it.
retrogametech Tip: console name is GameBoy Advance SP
retrogametech Today i got a perfectly fine, 100 working, good condition, GBA SP for 4 (got it off a friend)
retrogametech Ive read about it and seen the result. Never tried it myself.
retrogametech I Need To Get A DS Lite Like That. My Lites Top Screen Is Faulty. The L Button Is Missing And R Doesnt Work. Really Sucks, It Was My First As Well As A Christmas Gift Back In 2007. I Noticed DS Games I Played On My 3DS Looked Like They Took A Graphics Hit.
retrogametech When youve finished the NESs, would you be willing to sell me one or do you want to trade for something? PM me!
retrogametech i opened it up and heated up a piece of it yea. lol.. but so far no real techy fixes.. :)
retrogametech What is his ebay account because i would by a refurbished system from him
retrogametech Interesting videos, I remember when I found out how to fix dropped G.B.As, it took 5 seconds to fix and without any soldering, I sold one on and made about 40 profit, I would have fixed a lot more if Nintendo hadnt released the S.P. so soon. Then I bought a faulty S.P  fitted the glass  lighting to my translucent G.B.A, with some extra l.e.ds on the sides  a switch, that was my first D.I.Y project.
retrogametech Yes, the 3DS is more or less the same size as the DSL. It fits in regular DS cases etc
retrogametech That was a great video. Im off to play my handheld console in the bath... whilst repeatedly changing games cartridges.
retrogametech Hi,Do you have any more information on how this was made? I want to make something similar is there a schematic you followed at all?
retrogametech Yep! :P . My prototype was actually made using a 7.5V PSOne PSU. It powered all 3 systems ok but was struggling and getting a bit hot with the amount of current being drawn. A PSOne PSU would probably be sufficient for powering a Mega Drive and 32X combo on their own though.
retrogametech Its not, its really easy. You just need to strip a few wires and solder them together :) .
retrogametech Yeah I did lol. Cheeky! I have the real OutRun coming in not long from now, so that adventure will be over. Seriously though, this is McGuyver type ingenuity. Why I love watching your stuff!
retrogametech Just visted your site, very cool! I really like the simplified daisy chain design you use. Im not surprised people are eager to buy these things!
retrogametech Very copla mem thanks
retrogametech Interesting, can I ask how long you played and did you compare the picture quality before and after? Ive tried similar experiments and concluded that, with the MegaCD especially, the lack of a dedicated ground completely killed picture quality.
retrogametech i would love to see a tutorial for this!
retrogametech is there a way to remove the yellow from an old SNES without having lab equipment?
retrogametech The reason im asking is because i just bought one for 60 dollars, and it works perfectly, only downside is that it didnt come in the original box. I got it for my collection and considering how difficult it is to find one in working order especially in my country, i kind of scared that it will break if i keep using, because a play a lot.
retrogametech GOODD i really dont get how people can go back to graphics like that these days...each to their own obviously a big up for being able to but personally i just think they look poop lol
retrogametech RetroGameTech cheers mate,
retrogametech Cool to see this version MVS board. First thing I noticed was the battery. Is that stock? Good video man:)
retrogametech This video is probably my first tutorialish video on how to build a CMVS :) I have some MV1C boards that I desperately want to consolize and Im trying to balance that, with tutorials on soldering, desoldering.. and work! Haha! Great video, subscribed :) Btw what setup is the board connected to right now? Is it just a custom supergunjamma setup?
retrogametech I was surprised how quickly the UniBIOS arrived! Im looking forward to messing about with it. Its actually kinda cool to see how they improved the board design and replaced a lot of the big IC chips with much smaller surface mount components. Its a really tidy and compact design! Im not sure on the materials yet. Probably just a combination of different thickness MDF. Its easy to work with, durable and paints well. I want it to look sleek, minimalistic and simple. Any suggestions?
retrogametech Yep, its an excellent piece of kit! Itll save me loads of time and potential frustration, lol
retrogametech I actually own a copy of this! I bought it at Ayr market for 2.
retrogametech its as good as sonic 06
retrogametech Definitely Do So!! I Have A Spare Youtube Channel For Handheld Gaming Related Stuff, All My Videos Are Very Poor In Quality.
retrogametech looks like super mario advance (
retrogametech The sound that plays after Sonic picks up rings in this game is from the Pokemon games.
retrogametech This game makes duke Nukem forever almost look good.... Almost.
retrogametech That ring colected sound is from pokemon.
retrogametech Funny that the bootlegs have better copy protection
retrogametech Oh hey, its Rayman IV  Crash IV all over again. XD Wow, didnt know the fake Sonic boxart Id seen actually corresponded to a massproduced bootleg. Thanks for showing this off, its rather entertaining to see just how many bootleg reskins there are of this.
retrogametech Up for selling the other set?
retrogametech Nice fix. Those actually arent proprietary cables. Based on the logo and shape, those are displayport connectors, usually used on monitors. Kind of strange to see them on a nondisplay item, but I guess they probably wanted a standardsbased connector that supported the amount of pinouts they need for 5.1 sound. Interesting.
retrogametech lol great price. I bet the Tritton company makes a lot of money repairing systems from the design flaw...
retrogametech Thanks for all you do love all your videos. You are real easy to listen to and I have learned a lot from what you do because of you I was able to fix my GBA SP that I bought at a swap meet that was sold to me broke :( so I really appreciate all you do.
retrogametech Which component did you connect the voltage regulator to?
retrogametech Did you get these boards going mate??
retrogametech Wosk Sam Vesu is czech but I cant get google translate to work on it so.......
retrogametech Thats really good, you might get this MVS working sooner then you thought!
retrogametech what exactly is an MVS?
retrogametech Its SNKs NeoGeo arcade system. The home system is AES.
retrogametech nice video :) how long do the batteries usually last for Game Boy Color progress saves?
retrogametech I doubt youd be able to fit something like this inside a GBA cart. Although, only a few GBA games actually use batteries for saving. From what Ive seen its mostly only bootlegs that use batteries. There were also a handful of early genuine titles that use them but its pretty uncommon.
retrogametech Damn, that is a great question.
retrogametech Sapphire ruby and emerald still save just fine. Its just the in game events that require it to be a certain time wont happen. Gbas use some sort of rewritable ROM because it would be smarter, for technologys sake, to stop relying on batteries to save games like that. The only pkmn games you should be worrying about are the GBGBC ones but like liquidhalo said, get one of those backup thingymabobs and use this mod. Ill get around to doing this once I get my game bit screwdriver in the mail.
retrogametech Although I would resort to emulation instead of this, I still found this very interesting.
retrogametech now I have a cartridge that is flat it doesnt have the space that your has, now will it fit a cartridge like links awakening
retrogametech If only Nintendo used FRAM to hold the game saves.
retrogametech Can you Please make a Video of you putting it in and everything you did. I want to do this from my pokemon yellow game.
retrogametech Guys I dont think hed ever sell this. Since its so rare
retrogametech Here in Canada the law is that if the system and games are out of production you can mod it if they are in production you can not
retrogametech Just a question:Have you ever bought a faulty item that you werent able to get working again?
retrogametech You have to give it back now.
retrogametech excellent.. still got my modified xbox with executer 2.6 (nonsolder chip) with 80gb hard drive networked upto 2 pcs :) , still love the original xbox.. had a few modified ones over the years.
retrogametech The original xbox was (sorry still is!) amazing. The only bad feature is how bulky and ugly it is. Fantastic find my friend! Really nice. Your home modded version looks a great deal nicer though. Loving all your videos, keep em coming!
retrogametech What Ever Happened To That Catchy Tune You Used To Have Playing During Your Videos?
retrogametech Thats not an XBOX... Its a SEXBOX!!! :P Nice mod dude.
retrogametech I have another Xbox with an Xecuter 3 modchip but a faulty drive... Ill need to remove it and install it to my main Xbox!
retrogametech Never boring Martin :) Taint That The Fuckin Truth!! Just A Stupid, Maybe Useless Idea. If The Chips Get Hot Why Not Try To Add A Small Fan Over Them? A VideoGameConsole Modder, Goes By MODDEDbyBACTERIA Uses Small Fans To Keep CPUs On His Handheld Consoles From Getting Too Hot. Maybe You Could Use A Multimeter And Run A Fan Over The Chips?
retrogametech Hey bro, first off you need to pick up a Unibios for that machine, you can get them on eBay for around 30 or type in Universe bios in google and you can find what Im talking about. With the unibios it will show you what is wrong and allow you to force the mvs into aes mode so you can still play the games. Very important other point is that the cart slot NEEDS TO be attached with the game in it, not just the board only
retrogametech I think your floor is on LSD.
retrogametech I had the same problem with my MVS i got, I didnt have an JAMMA connector so i had to solder directly from the pins to the SCART. When i tried it on both of my TVs it switched to the channel but no picture, same problem as you. I then changed the sync pin on the scart from 20 to 19 and i got picture :).
retrogametech Probably worth swapping the capacitors with some new ones as the old ones might be broken. ASSEMberX has a good guide! watch?vUY5ouIXVQc
retrogametech I just got this from eBay a couple of days ago! Looks awesome for something that tiny! Just gotta get the Mega CD32X combo and it will be complete! :D
retrogametech What was that in the 32x?
retrogametech I wish there was a tiny cables to go with it,and then purchase different cartirdges. That would be awesome.
retrogametech I bet you had to shell out a lot of dough for that p
retrogametech Thats really awesome! :D
retrogametech now all you need is a Vending egg TV to play it
retrogametech Must resist the urge to start hunting these down!!
retrogametech Congratulations on completing the set. When the panel opened up to reveal an actual scale expansion port edge connector, it was a little mindblowing. You almost expect it to have traces painted on.
retrogametech You got to do a vid on that, dude! XD Id love to see the Dreamcast and Master System versions!
retrogametech Not decided yet. It kinda depends on if I can get it work right now. I might consider building a mini cab or making some sort of console style housing for it.
retrogametech Great stuff bro, one thing I totally made a mistake on is this. For the mvs 1 slot you can use a regular jamma cable, no sound wire switch necessary. I cant believe I forgot about that. With multi slot boards you have to do this but that single slot board shouldnt need any messing around with, just make sure to hook up that 5v line so you can play jamma boards with sound
retrogametech A mini cab would be cool but Im not sure I have the space. Ill probably go with building a housing of some sort for it. After seeing some gameplay of the games on that multicart I really want to get this working again so I can have a shot! :P
retrogametech I hope you get this board working as im not familiar with Neo Geo hardwate or anything.
retrogametech Ive got a load of these in the loft. I just got bored of fixing them, they are just a pain in the arse, especially the multi slot boards. Heres a hint though, if you stick a UniBios in there you can bypass a few of the error messages like calendar ram and backup ram errors. Also check plated through holes and make sure to check for broken traces under the PCB from poor handling. Good luck!
retrogametech Ive been wanting a pair for my sms! Thanks for this video because im not paying all that for a pair of broken sms 3D glasses!
retrogametech Totally worth checking out! I actually wear glasses a lot of the time as well. But the cool thing is these 3D frames are designed to fit over regular glasses. They fit over the top of mine no problem. Youll just end up looking a bit special while playing your Master System. Good times!
retrogametech so would this work for the famicom?
retrogametech i have a megadrive exuiped with a master system converter and iu plugged the 3d adapter in i know it works but who wants to borrow me a few games
retrogametech I have a pair of the modern shutter glasses as well, and I can tell you that they are far more comfortable. I believe that most of the trouble with the SEGA 3D glasses actually comes from the adapter nowadays. I noticed that the image was affected by bumping the adapter one day, so I opened it up to see what was wrong. The metal contacts in the jack needed to be adjusted to make a better connection, and now both sets of glasses work great.
retrogametech Thanks! Im pretty pleased I got it back to its original working condition :)
retrogametech you know, they do make smaller florescent tubes like that, a pc case i ordered came with one that was about half the size. so that might be something to look for next time space is an issue.
retrogametech You have done a nice job but i think youve missed a real trick not listening to those people that suggested you put a video or photo player playing ngage images that would have been really cool.
retrogametech Awesome . You any good at replaceing ipod touch glass screens . If so how much if you could .
retrogametech Check out a site called Ebluar. They have them for a pretty good price.
retrogametech I went out and bought this the day you posted this video. Super excited for it finally came in the mail and sort of disappointed. I can figure out how to get this thing saving. in configuration it has save mode and it says auto and forced I tried both but it doesnt keep any saves. I save in game, I quit. I start another game save that. come back to the first game, no more saved data... Any help?
retrogametech nice xbox in the background
retrogametech where do you live? there is one buy a different company on amazon uk, just search gba flash you should be able to spot it
retrogametech You made me download Klonoa
retrogametech Thats cool man. How much does it cost?
retrogametech Thanks, dude! I got the EZ from a Chinese site called ebluar. Although It seems to be down right now. The GB USB I bought from Kitsch Bent in the US. Both sources are very reliable :) (in my experience).
retrogametech Does anyone know of something like this but it also plays GBC and original GB games? I would love to have one for my DS.
GameSack a big Meeting of old School heads. Too bad i live in Germany. I bet that Metal Jesus Rocks, Angry Video Game Nerd and the Nostalgia Critic will be there too.
GameSack Have fun there guys! And if you have time, when you get back, why not make a short video for those of us who cannot attend to let us know what you found there that was interesting. And thanks for the last video. I love how you guys tend to make every video these days at least 25 minutes long. They really are like episodes, and while I love genre videos, the console ones are my favorites!
GameSack Crap! I have to pick one convention. This, CGE, or Portland. This decision has become pretty hard.
GameSack I wish i could come to meet up with yall and play some games
GameSack alpha mega sin is .. only complaining on his channel... he is lame
GameSack when are you guys coming to Chicago?
GameSack Ah, hell yeah!! I definitely have to go now.
GameSack Sorry I cant attend! I live in the UK and My parents will be in Naples at that point in time
GameSack Another awesome video as usual guys! I dont own the NeoGeoCD, but this video games me want to own one!
GameSack Btw is that Iron Clad an actual copy or a bootleg? I mean that game goes for around 500 now and its just simply not that great of a game for its price.
GameSack I wonder if the ratio between the time I spend waiting for my NG:CD to load is comparable to the difference in money I would make working for that same amount of time, and spending the money on an MVS version of the same game instead. Perhaps, but Im too impatient to do the calculations P
GameSack Dave... you flicking faggot.
GameSack Also guys was the ending sequence a shot a the elitist attitude that most of the collectors show? Lol man they must be pissed lol!
GameSack I love the time these guys put into their videos, its what separates them from a lot of the other reviewers.
GameSack You were able to point out the loading times on Last Blade in quite an amusing way.The skit at the end was priceless as well. Hope to see more, as with the X68000 comp as well!
GameSack Great episode as always.
GameSack Savage Reign looks insane, looked it up and it is on the Fun Super Combo Ps2 game released in Japan, so I actually have a chance to play it! Thanks Game Sack!
GameSack Id like to own a neo cd at some point, ive got AES and MVS in a candy cabinet. Prices are indeed out of reach for the most people on AES, but MVS is clearly the best option (just needs a supergun to be usable outside a cab). CDs just dont feel right for neo games, but then again its just my opinion. Still, a good addition to someones collection, its SNK hardware after all !
GameSack Nice episode. To restart a game hold down all four buttons and startselect, it will take you back to the CD Audio menu.
GameSack Is that a real Turf masters? If so that is quite amazing!
GameSack I love Samurai Shodown 4. I used to play it so much in the arcade. The first time when I beat it I felt like I was gonna crap myself because it was the first game I ever beat, also I was about 7 and I used an exploit on the last boss to beat him.. yea I wasnt really that good. :P
GameSack Golden axe shirt rocks. Arent you a Nintendo fan or did you have a change of heart in an episode I havent seen yet ?
GameSack get loot get it get ship do again xD
GameSack 12:42 II thought it said DERPY and got really excited...
GameSack (Original post: Was my post deleted?)Sorry, it was gone... I even clicked all comments, expanded the whole page and CtrlFsearched for just my name, and could not find it. I have put thousands of hours into my retexture projects and gotten nothing in return so my frustration level can climb easily.GTG and thanks,Jay
GameSack subscribed. and great vid
GameSack Imagine zero gunner 2 and bangaio if dreamcast came with twin sticks..
GameSack Cant remember if you guys coverd the best JAPOnly game of them all yet. Adventure of little Ralph for PSXPS1 :)One word, Awesome!
GameSack Nice work on showing the PC Engine some more attention. For the next Left episode you can do even more PCE stuff. Lots of great games on that platform. From hucards to super cd to arcade card cd games like ports of neo geo games.
GameSack Great episode. Needs more Koei.
GameSack Zanac for the PS1! No one talks abou this game. :(We only got the NES version here in North America.
GameSack Thanks for hanging lampshades on you pronunciation fails.
GameSack Wtf is up with these names.? Lmao lol
GameSack On Wikipedia, Brian Finneran is 102, 395 LBS and 75 years old.
GameSack YouTube reverse field
GameSack this is the ultimate porn
GameSack What the hell did I just watch?!? D
GameSack Best stopmotion short EVER! Not only was it hilarious, but you also somehow managed to make me feel very uncomfortable watching it. Good job!
GameSack 390 hours of work wellspent!
GameSack Nice top logo with Soldier Blade! WORD!
GameSack Wait a second. Was the N64 fapping to its own mother?
GameSack better love story than twilight
GameSack lol for consoles the snes and ps1 are probably in my top 3 favorite consoles ever i really cant decide on the 3rd soooo yea.. nice vidhandheld wise its gameboy color, psp, 3ds  vita (i love both and tho i favor the vita more.. i gotta get my new pokemon games and mario games fix somehow
GameSack How do you get into the BETA ?
GameSack Can someone please give me some pointers. I want to start making videos and doing my own walkthroughs on youtube. Unfortunately idk enough about the copyright issues where if you do a walkthrough of a game it can be removed by the publisher. I heard its only for newer games but a few have said that games of last gen(ps3360) you can still have your videos removed from doing those too. Would it be best if i just stuck to doing Retro games(Thats kinda what i want to do though)? i heard HDpvrs are an awful choice when trying to record games through an Svideo output? That they were designed only for HD Gaming? If i want to record a ps1 or 2 games from my ps3 will it show the game correctly or will it drop in frames. SorrY if these are dumb questions but i must know!
GameSack The first Playstation is my favourite console up till today. You can just have unlimited fun with the many awesome old titles that its incredible. To mention few which werent mentioned: Rayman, Akuji, Gex, Legend of Kartia (never heard anybody talkin bout it), DoDonpachi (my fav shmup), Discworld, Fear Effect 2, Medievil... way too many to count.
GameSack Alucard  Dracula backwards
GameSack i wish i saved all the copies of official playstation mag i had, literally hundreds of demo discs one for each issue
GameSack who hates the metroidvania games? i will destroy them!!!!!!!!
GameSack no Crash Bandicoot? that was fun game
GameSack My favorite PS game ??? N20: Nitrous Oxide !!!!
GameSack Did they really have to review Metal Gear Solid?
GameSack If it werent for crash bandicoot Idk how I wouldve made it through that first year of middle school.
GameSack The word you were looking for at the end of the Socket portion was labyrinthine.
GameSack Vectorman was a VERY good game , you old fat bastards are high.
GameSack Crash Bandicoot  Spyro the Dragon.And who could forget Original the Character?
GameSack How could you forget the worst mascot of all...Bubsy. He was HORRIBLE. Instead of being cool he came off like a prick. I believe the company who designed them bankrupted themselves, after a very hard push to make him a household name.
GameSack hey i really liked billy hatcher.loved the soundtrack and plays nice(is mario sunshine more or less)
GameSack Vector man was ok but Croc was awsome since I had both. Im surprised u didnt mention about the third game in the series that didnt see the light of day. Also what about alex kidd? Segas first mascot before Sonic appeared and told him to get lost before he asked him to go kart racing?
GameSack i think kid kool should be added hes becoming more and more forgotten most gamers i know and sega fanboys dont know of him
GameSack Hah, that was funI just wish I recognized more of these mascots. Dont think Ive actually played any of them but I know Captain Commando from MVC, Vectorman from friends and its inclusion on several Sega collections, and Punky Skunk because skunks are awesome and my favorite animal and I make it a point to know things about them.Id totally watch more of these if you wanted to release more lost mascot games.A few in particular Id love to see are Willy from Rockin Kats, Aero the AcroBat and Rocky Rodent. Just some ideas
GameSack Vectorman!!!.... FOREVER!!!!!
GameSack Hilarious! Great job!!
GameSack Making top10s of the 8bit, 64bit and GameBoy times will probably break you guys down.Good luck though, I enjoyed the video even though there were other games in my list.
GameSack Rock and roll racing best
GameSack Joe!!! How do you video capture your Sega Genesis! I have an El Gato Video capture that I hook to a VCR to get the Antenna inComposite Out converter. It works for NES and Super Nintendo, but I get black and white for GenesisMega Drive and Atari 2600! Please help me! I want color for Genesis!
GameSack WHERES SONIC!At least Super Mario World made the list
GameSack your intro is too long and it sucks. Seriously
GameSack How in the blue  is it possible that there is no Streets of Rage game in this top 10?!
GameSack (wipes tear) Ive been with you guys since the beginning! Just under a different username, because you know...Google. Oh, how they grow so fast.
GameSack when these guys talk, it reminds me of derek roddy. most be from the same part of the us
GameSack Sack Sack Sack! ...kutgw guys :)
GameSack How can you not have seen DBZ?
GameSack Hey you should try out DragonballZ: Hyper Dimension. I had a blast with that game. Tight controlls, unique characters with different abilties. Although being quite easy it is still a hell lot of fun.
GameSack I do not agree with his comments on Eternal champions at all. The game had good music and graphically had better graphics than street fighter or mortal kombat when it came out on genesis. The game was fun and Eternal champions on sega cd was fun as hell. This guy seems to be kind of biased in my opinion. All my friends with super Nintendo always commented on the games graphics and music back in the day about how good they were.
GameSack What no wipeout?!? You monsters!
GameSack You didnt even covered rhe good ones... power rangers fighting edition and weaponlord, or any of takaras snk ports
GameSack That was a pretty cool episode, brought back a lot of memories. Theres TONNES of extra unlockable characters in Eternal Champions challenge from the darkside, I think theres about 1012 unlockables ranging in quality from whoa sweet to really?
GameSack no power instinct, no primal rage, no double dragon V no art of fighting, no fatal fury, no samurai showdown, no astral bout, no battle masters...what is this? only shitty snes and sega fighting games?
GameSack You guys should cover the game Iron  Blood: Warriors of Ravenloft... the DD fighting game for the PSOne.
GameSack KI was. Good fighting game used to kick butt people line up to watch me and my old friends play nothing better then 20 30 people around also mortal kombat was huge and we locked ass this my friend was way better coulddo 30 hit combos lolgoos old days miss that
GameSack I noticed that when I miss my shots I swear like crazy
GameSack battletoads was released nes snes genesis lol and mame woot :P
GameSack Id love to see some fighting games on an episode of Left in the Arcade. Maybe BloodStorm by Strata.
GameSack Blood Bros....the inspiration for NATSUMEs Wild Guns on the Super Nintendo? If not, its sure close.
GameSack wow blood brothers looks like wild guns on the snes. a lot.Have you guys done a video on hidden NES games? Im sure but if you have I havent seen it yet.
GameSack i was gonna watch this.. and then i saw the green screen. and paused the video, and now im leaving. pathetic attempt at a game channel. really.
GameSack Life is too difficult, flashmob attack go back to your Xbox and Aqua Deadlight. YOU MIGHT GET THAT VIRTUAL ITEM!!
GameSack Awesome. Always wanted to see a home version of Rad Mobile and Wing War. Sonic the Hedgehog arcade would be cool too. Thanks!
GameSack Great episode! Thanks for turning me on to Boogie Wings: that games kerraaaazy!!
GameSack Data East: The king of hidden gems
GameSack I swear if Battletoads and Bucky O Hare get put on XBLA I will fucking buy that shit twice.One for myself and another for my bro.
GameSack You are great I wish I was you
GameSack The 2v2 thing sounds cool man, good commentary btw!
GameSack that gametype is so much fun. And i so much look forward to seeing you do competitive games :) your be a beast 3
GameSack That seems like a pretty cool computer, and I like the way the case is deigned, thanks fr the episode guys
GameSack 22:40This is one of the coolest things Ive seen.
GameSack People go one about how great the X68000 is compared to consoles of the time, but at 3000 its little wonder. Even the Neo Geo was cheap in comparison. I dont think its at all relevant to compare the X68000 to the PCEngine, Mega Drive or SNES. Anyway, at least people can enjoy the machine these days.
GameSack These shows just keep getting more and more amazing!
GameSack I hope you guys do a PC98 episode soon
GameSack Cant believe you havent mentioned ChoRenSha 68k
GameSack you guys did a great job reviewing this system!!!
GameSack Excellent Video Guys :) Got yourselves a new subscriber.
GameSack Great job, thank you.
GameSack What X68000 game is the music used in the beginning of the video from?
GameSack 18:30  New tab, theisozone.com, looking for Toe Jam and Earl 3
GameSack Oh my god, Dave in a Fugazi shirt 3  3
GameSack Damn that Steven Seagull game was just horrible! Thanks for sharing it!Fav. part was the Halflife on Dreamcast dev kit, freakin amazing
GameSack Mr Nutz Hopping mad was released for the Amiga
GameSack What about Propeller Arena on the Dreamcast? The game was 100 ready, and its disc image is easy to find on the net. Oh, and graphics and gameplay wise, the game is pretty good. Last but not least, it was made by Yu Suzuki.
GameSack I think ResQ was on the Sega Channel only
GameSack Great video, but, I am surprised that Bio Force Ape wasnt featured since its probably the most legendary unreleased game of all time (and one of the better ones too!)
GameSack Hey Guys, as recommended by you to state some unreleased games worth mentioning I thought I would, how about Playstation, you missed the entire console. So biased, please make some dedicated shows to Playstation (especially PS1) or at least include them in your topics of discussion. Thanks, good video though guys as usual. :)
GameSack You guys are so fuking uglyweird looking. Your background, and video presentation is like some fucking 80s bullshit, and your voiceover guy sounds like he is retarded. All in All though I tend to quite like your show! Keep up the good work!
GameSack At least one grammar Nazi had to take the field: Steal an enemies duffel bag is incorrect. It should be Steal an enemys duffel bag or steal the enemies duffel bag. Including the word an implies one enemy and so you wouldnt take the plural of enemy and make that possessive. Using the word the could insinuate multiple enemies owning one duffel bag thereby, making it correct. THE MORE YOU KNOW!
GameSack I love Maris batman tshirt
GameSack Joven so much faceplam
GameSack sohinki should of been on franklins body and lasercorn should been on trevors body because of his face he made
GameSack I LIKE SMOSH GAMES WEN THEY PLAY GTA5
GameSack Third the nerd second the best first the worst
GameSack I want gta sooo bad...its still so freakin expensive!
GameSack Dumbest fucking gaming channel on earth, not even funny. I didnt even have to watch, and i know they are fucking stupid.
GameSack You guys need to step up your game to get on par with other gamers on YouTube... you dont even look, sound or seem like youre enjoying what youre playing. Also, relying on random cut aways for comedy is not that effective. I think Smosh might want to start looking for some more entertaining commentators soon. Just my opinion.
GameSack 3rd is the one the hairy chest
GameSack no 1st is the worst 2nd is the best and 3rd is the one with the hairy chest
GameSack gets on bus with retro towerbus driver:hey!you have to pay for two passengers!:P

GameSack I really like the top gear music a lot nice touch guys.

GameSack Great episode! Daves shirt is AWESOME!!! Any chance on you guys doing a Phantasy Star or Soul Series episode?
GameSack OMG, I know that MOD file in that 32X game... its Guitar Slinger! I remember making a little song of my own with the samples in it! Joe, if you like MOD files, you should look at my channel... I write all of my music in IT format.
GameSack Oh mummy came out for the zx spectrum
GameSack Digger Chan is just a ripoff of Mr. Driller.
GameSack One of the greatest shows on Earth. Yes.
GameSack Game Under instead of Game Over? I dont get it
GameSack Man, where do you guys get all your amazing shirts? I really want a Dreamcast shirt! :D

GameSack Kinda missing NBA Jam and NHL Hitz 2003, those are great arcade sports games.Also I quite enjoy racing sports games like the F1, Moto GP and DTM Race Driver series.
GameSack If you do another sports video, include nhl 94
GameSack People need to stop complaining that you guys didnt include a certain games in your episode. Guys, I can imagine that making an episode for Game Sack could be hard, because of how high quality their videos are. Just appreciate all the work Joe and Dave did to make this video for you guys, seriously!
GameSack Make a Gaming on Christmas episode!
GameSack My favorite NES sports games were Blades of Steel (which lets you play Gradius during intermission), Baseball Stars, and Punch Out. I had NFL Quarterback Club on SNES which was fun, oh and Wayne Gretzky and the NHLPA All Stars.
GameSack Edit: Dont worry, this is a positive comment!Im watching this, and sports bore me most of the time! I just like watching LPs done by people who have interesting things to say.
GameSack Obviously you guys are not sport game fans and that is fine...i get it but to enjoy a game because it is Easy vs More Challenging is like talking to my 12 year old. Hey son why dont you like this game? Because it is too hard and I want to win every time. Well sometimes you need to learn how to beat and strategize, Son. I dont want to...it should be easy. Ha! To each their own but this review was almost pointless because you do not go deep enough to explain (besides graphics and easyness of the game)  like a kid reviewing a game. Where as say Madden(which I agree is an abomination now) didnt just update graphics and add teams but added stats, season long stats, leader boards, etc...the thing most sport fans enjoy. Same as EAs BBall series. It started as a plain lets play 5 on 5 Bball and by the end of the Genesis era you could trade players, create players, track career stats, etc...which for that genre was a BIG deal. But due to the lack of your knowledge you focus on the Silly music in the first game and claim that is the best one. Same thing with the Tecmo series. Yes the first one was fine but so shallow. Tecmo Super Bowl 3 is more complex but it is leaps and bounds better than the original IMHO. I think you guys are better off not even doing this video. Its like a nonRPG player reviewing the 8bit and 16bit consoles in the same time span. Well I didnt like FFIII because it was just too complex and deep. Ill stick with whatever the 1st RPG game was because they wore funny clothes and I could beat it easily.I did enjoy your Recent Japan PC Game console  I forget the name.
GameSack mutant league football and hockey! deion Sanders sports talk football!
GameSack Over 60,000 views and in a very short time. You have to make more sports episodes now! :D
GameSack Jo Marcel ich wollte dir sagen dein Ts Server geht wieder und ich bin drinnen )
GameSack actually I think (Im not sure) that Americas is a technical term to call North and South America.
GameSack Its like draft in MTG.
GameSack When they say the Americas, they are probably talking about North and South America. Silly azneyes
GameSack ...This is so...stupid, what happens if you pull vanillas, and you have to put them in your deck? You would never be able to win, these decks made straight out of packs would have no synergy...like, this makes absolutely NO sense.
GameSack intresting at best.......... i would try it MT93
GameSack Konami better do what microsoft did and actually LISTEN to what your player base want and dont want. I really want to get competitive but after this bullshit, fuck that.
GameSack Too be fair isnt Yugioh all ready sack to win?
GameSack I dont know why people are freaking out about this. I know MtG is different from Yugioh, but magic has had a Draft format for a while. Its actually REALLY skill testing, and requires you to know what your opening from the set and building a strategy from that. It isnt really about opening bombs, and more about building a decent deck with synergies. I dont really see the issue with this as a setup. To be fair, I dont think konami builds the sets with drafters in mind so this might be more of an issue, but youre building a 20 card deck.
GameSack You know.... I think google bought both Youtube AND Koonami at once
GameSack If Konami is the one providing the packs, I am not complaining.
GameSack I wish I could make my own review of the Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner series, its just the Devil Summoner games, 1 and 2, because thats all Ive played of the Shin Megami Tensei series, but I digress, I cannot do so because Ive no way to make a video. I do not have a camera or mic, unfortunately, so while I would love to go into detail on Devil Summoner 1 and 2, despite the removal of character limits on comments, well, I kinda doubt youd read all of it. Everything about it just makes for a REALLY long comment. But what I can say is that DS 1 is already pretty dang fun, and I like it, but DS 2 improves a LOT. Gives you a few improvements that while playing 1, I was hoping they would make, but they changed even almost the ENTIRE control scheme AND how the battles go! The music, I dont know about, I didnt really pay attention much, since Id only gotten the games not too long ago. The graphics are not too bad in the first one, and I dont think they change too terribly much between the two.
GameSack Streets of Rage 2 comes to mind as well as Panzer Dragoon 2. :)
GameSack Just a small error. In Castlevania Adventure and Belmonts Revenge you play as Christopher Belmont, not Simon Belmont.
GameSack I remember when I was playing Super mario and 6 golden coins On my gameboy pocket.Epic.One of the best mario games ever.
GameSack Oddworld Abes Oddysee was a great game, one of my favorite of all time. but Oddworld Abes Exoddus was the superior game by far. with added gameplay mechanics and an improved save system the sequel took everything we loved from the first and made it a hundred times better... however the same cannot be said for every installment released since. and with a new game on the horizon i can hardly wait to play the HD remake of the first game, renamed as New n Tasty!
GameSack Nice episode, guys! What about Jurassic Park: The lost world for sega genesis? Have you played it? Are you going to highlight it in your future episodes?
GameSack tony hawk 2 is a zillion times better than tony hawk 1
GameSack I know you already talked about this, but, Streets of Rage 2 is light years superior to Streets of Rage.
GameSack Wtf . Thats not how you use a stick
GameSack Im surprised the Game Genie didnt break with all that weight on top of it.
GameSack Maybe if we go back to giant 200 cartridges, we wouldnt have all this broken disc drive trouble! Heck, you could even include the indisc DLC for that much!
GameSack Hey Wada ya know Jo great video , like someone else said Id like to see you guys do more of a neo geo feature
GameSack I want a Neo Geo AES still, but still quite expensive for a console that is 23 years old. Games are more expensive on ebay than a Wii U, PS3 or 360 console. Still cheaper than a PS4 console, but come on that is ridiculous.
GameSack good one joe! but did you know it also works with the 32X! lol! love the show guys when im not commercial fishing or playing video games during the long cold alaskan winters im watching Game Sack! you guys are the perfect match up of NES fanboy and Sega Fanboy. i love both soo is awesome. id have to say tho that sega has the most broken games ( HEAVY NOVA!) the genesis was the first system i bought myself w my paper route money. Keep them videos coming and Game On!
GameSack Saw the video, tried all that stuff on my 2 slot MVS machine... guess it only works for the AES.
GameSack Yeah...NEO GEO at its best! Great generation!
GameSack They did make a game about Pepsi...Pepsi man...
GameSack Jazz Jackrabbit might be one. First game was perfect, but second... Well, technically it was good, had better graphics, level editor and multiplayer... But something was off. All fun was taken out, 3D bonus levels, boss fights werent so entertaining and that title rap track... Oh god, I hated it  JJ1 title music is so much better.
GameSack crafting music from FFXIV 1.0 at the end there. WTF?
GameSack SparksterRocket Knight 2 for the Genesis is garbage! Thank God the El Viento sequel never came here.
GameSack Zelda II, that game was awesome! Its one of the best in the series imo.
GameSack Hexen II deserves an honorary mention, even though you dont really cover PC games here. The original took the Doom engine and turned it into something even more amazing with hubbased levels, event scripting, rotating doors, and multiple player classes. The Quakeengined sequel followed up with jerky controls, halfassed levels, sadistic difficulty and recycled MIDI music (in 1997).
GameSack Outrun Europa on the Amiga was disappointing. It wasnt terrible, but it also strayed far from the original Outrun design. Another great episode. Keep up the good work.
GameSack Where can I sign up for the Gamesack school of acting? Are swishy pants a requirement?
GameSack Hey! That chick on the XGames FMV is Suzy Kolber. Shes still on ESPN and covers the NFL. Can anyone say cougar? Haha
GameSack FATHFuck all the Hacker

GameSack Shit of Quick scoperSOQS
GameSack BTM  Beat the Mummels :D
GameSack ABAB  aiming beaster are back
GameSack in Dracula X Chronicles, you can unlock both the original Rondo of Blood, and Symphony of the Night by collecting 2 hidden items... so that game is actually the best version of the game. The SOTN version included also lets you play as richter and Maria right off the bat without having to complete the game first. Unfortunately it doesnt have the extra areas from the saturn version.
GameSack I really like joe but he looks about as smart as a cave man but I love there episodes no offense dude your still a kick ass dude and I would love to grab beers with you two anytime
GameSack I am a Castlevania geek and I only wish I had a TG16 CD so I could play that version of that game. I have the PSP disc and agree about the controls in the remake.I also am glad I have the org PS1 disc for SOTN and bought the download for my PS3PSP as I loved the original crappy voice acting in the org and hated the replacement voices on the PSP!
GameSack Castle of Illusion and Duck Tails are remakes I am glad to have on my PSN although I still love playing the originals also, but as well I will have to check out The Monkey Kind as it looks interesting.
GameSack Guys dont worry about TMNT REshelled you dodged a bullet. Its utter crap and cant even hold a candle to any of the old TMNT beatemups. I downloaded it and played it one time, dropped it and went right back to the old games.
GameSack wild arms alter code f was a great remake in my mind....
GameSack I like Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD ReMix because of its gameplay, grahpic, and music updates
GameSack resident evil and metal gear for the gamecube!
GameSack super neo mega turbo? super neo mega turbo 267800 mark 3 and im in!
GameSack Bei Rahm kommt die Folge morgen noch. Da ich leider ohne Sound aufgenommen habe, bin ich noch am Basteln und meine Folge kommt noch spter )
GameSack I do this without the screen play I forced 3 fumbles in a row with the same person and scored all three times with it using the play I choose thunder struck or thunder something and forced a fumble or sacked the quarter back all 3 downs every time ! And this is my first day ever playing it cause i got it today go to my channel and look and see what real blitz is ! And by the way I need some people to subscribe to me and my videos if yall wouldnt mind I show everything that is crazy and rarely happens but somehow I make it happen all the time like in stand punt returns and instant kick returns and my favorite blitzing play which cause a fumble or sack bout 90 of the time I hope yall enjoy
GameSack I dont need to know which dracula I am to be a dracula.
GameSack I remember Mad Balls!
GameSack If I could get a buck for every time the word colorful is used...
GameSack Acting backwords  as allways you create something original!,) Well done!
GameSack Hey Dave. You forgot to mention that the PS3XBOX Splatterhouse has the original Arcade game to unlock, and also Splatterhouse 23. Now thats fan service!
GameSack I wonder if you guys can do a Game Sack on some REALLY bad games, that they werent even licensed. Like Action 52.
GameSack Another Halloween appropriate gem on the Master System is Vampire. Its a pretty decent Castlevania clone.
GameSack You can only hear the monsters approach in enemy zero as they are invisible. There will be a series of electronic beeps when a monster is near, and the beeps increase in frequency the closer they are to you. Really scary.
GameSack Another great vid. Thx guys. Happy Halloween!
GameSack Epic episode bro Loved it one to the next one :D
GameSack You guys really deserve a whole lot more than 30.000 views per video. Not that 30 000 is bad at all, but its quite unsettling when a show as well produced as yours only gets 30 000, while lazily put together crap like Pewdiepie gets millions of view. I know it isnt your style, but you guys should really put more effort in PR. Make a facebook page, and a twitter page. End every video with dont forget to subsribe. Do what is necessary to get your awesome show out there. You deserve more.
GameSack Whats scary is that Dave rides dirty!
GameSack Nice really like the old silent era style. Dave magically hovering up the stairs at the end was pretty good to along with the carpet roll up.
GameSack Do a Kickstarter for the BluRay Authoring programs required.
GameSack next time ill just read the description...
GameSack i cant wait for your next halloween episode, i can see you put a lot of effort in your videos.
GameSack this reminds me of the haunting starring polterguy
GameSack GameSack. Best show on the internet.
GameSack I dont own one now, traded it in for a Panasonic 3DO years ago. I love my still fully working 3DO but miss my 32X and keep intending to repurchase one. I can definitely recommend it, especially for classic arcade games like Virtua RacerFighter, Kolibri and totally arcade perfect Space Harrier and After Burner. It had more good games than people think. In an interesting note I own a slightly suspicious version of DarXide on Nokias Ngage QD. A perfect conversion, and yes, I did originally own the 32X version and never had a problem beating the first level. I guess you just suck! Lol!!
GameSack i really like that you guys show unique games for each system.there where almost 1 or 2 games which i have i barely heard or seen for the system.
GameSack Im so glad Im not the only one that actually like Knuckles Chaotic very much. Sad that my Sega Genesis and 32X doesnt work anymore.
GameSack The virtural boy had a mostly good library. I dont care what the system was capable of, the games were fun
GameSack Hm.. PC Engine Afterburner doesnt look much different in my opinion.
GameSack Forget Doom, its all about Wolfenstein!
GameSack Do give the saturn sequel to Tempo a try... its deliciously bizarre. Comedy gold for your show.
GameSack Y the fuck! We covered this like 20yrs ago. Really? Find something else to do or talk about! LAME...
GameSack Who came up with the intro music? Where is it from? Its real catchy in a way and easy to listen to. Would be perfect as a soundtrack in a game
GameSack I for one would love to see a third Act Raiser.
GameSack lol at the AtGames Master System. XD
GameSack I have Uniracers still!
GameSack Landstalker on the Sega Genesis
GameSack I really really like CTR.
GameSack finally somebody gives the mark of kri some love
GameSack I really wanted another Mischief Makers. Loved it as a kid. Also I want another Skies of Arcadia
GameSack I played Ristar on the Sega Channel. Loved it. Also loved the Sega Channel.
GameSack Wacky Races  Dreamcast
GameSack I love this game but its too hard
GameSack Hi Friends,Enjoy the pictorial illustration of History and lore of Game of thrones, and this is about The Sack Of Kings Landing in House Baratheons Perspective
GameSack Kane you so tryhard?)
GameSack your right man I will try again and I will tell you when ok take care peace
GameSack Lewis can you friend me
GameSack hey lewis u should play more black ops 2 that is halaroius as halo 4!!
GameSack way to early to sack him.
GameSack ...HA HA HA, you Red Devilz HAVENT Got the VAVAVOOM !!!
GameSack Fergie left us 11 points clear of 2nd, champions winning 29 out of 38 games. He hands over to Moyes and we are 7th and out the cup in January. How is Fergie to blame?
GameSack All you plastic fans who have been spoilt during our successful run in the 9000s need to hang up your half and half scalves and go support Chelsea. Manchester United have been, and always will be a successful club. It will take Moyes a few seasons before he can transition into creating his own team and eventually getting rid of the deadwood that Fergie left behind when he retired. In all fairness its these players that are under performing, not Moyes. Half of them dont want to play for the badge, with exceptions like Rooney and Januzaj.Its been half a season and all you see is people complaining, give Moyes time, after all Ferguson was called to be sacked after 3 seasons at United. And look what he did. Have Faith! GGMU!
GameSack SO TRUE GET THAT GUY AS MANAGER
GameSack too many people overreacting to losses, many of them unlucky, and putting the players and the manager under too much pressure, we always needed the time to recover after losing the stability of having the most successful and influential manager ever.. the quality and potential is there as you saw last season, we dominated the league and won it by 11 points with more or less the same squad.. the players just need to gain some confidence back, maybe a fast creative midfield player who can hold up the ball as good as rooney can needs to be signed for a boost, but most of all we need certain talismen back from injuries that have come at an unfortunate time of the season eg. van persie, rooney, carrick.. get behind the team and stop acting like impatient, spoiled, entitled little bellends, united will turn it around like they always do
GameSack 6 more years fatso , 6 more years. I am the Chosen One.
GameSack Dont sack moyes plz he is too good for us Liverpool fans
GameSack i was there for atleast 30 mins
GameSack Awesome! Thanks for adding the quad sacks. Bama is kickin (I)! RMFT!!
GameSack Its War damn eagle you soft ass bitches!!!!
GameSack Gonna be funny when Bama loses to Auburn.
GameSack Sabin, Ive always stayed the whole game even when in the student section at LSU, whyd you have to leave for the gdamned Dolphins! LSU fans are stuck with Coach Miles who most certainly gives Les. The ass whoopings are getting worse each game. DAMN the football gods! Also, my respect for Zach soared after the 4th sac
GameSack LSWHO is down this year. so is the SEC which UAT and AUTURD are both PrEtENDERS. Missouri and the COCKS are JOKES too!!! The PAC12 is the strongest conference with the likes of STANFORD, Oregon, USC, and UCLA. FSU is number one by a MILE!!! FSU would kill any SEC PRETENDER TEAM this year.
GameSack Win the rest of the games ,win the ironbowl and knock Bama out of the championship hunt.. go on to play in the SEC championship is still reachable . yeah .. because this team is young and only going to get better next year This is off a 38 season when many said Auburn would be in the bottom of the SEC this year .. 6 to 7 wins was all that was expected . there is lot that can still be gained this year... If they stay focus and play them one at a time..
GameSack I wanna see Dees little dance that got him flagged.
GameSack They hired a former Jokeland Raider what did USC expect???
GameSack After what kiffin did to Tennessee Im glad hes gone hopefully he wont get to ruin another football program.
