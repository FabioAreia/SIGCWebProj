TopGear Imagine that thing with a Veyron engine...
TopGear Just ringing Churchill.....back in a bit
TopGear Ugly and usless i go for the porsche 918 or the ferrari LaFerrari
TopGear when in the hell are they going to review the agera?
TopGear Wow, that is a beast and beautiful car, with a pretty cool name.
TopGear that is the best lamboghini I have ever seen
TopGear toyota ft 1 is better
TopGear Whats the song at the beginning of the video ?
TopGear ive just watch the episode on Netflixs if only Mays clutch didnt go he would have made it
TopGear this was on Dave today
TopGear those incompetent copresenter XD
TopGear Slow and steady wins the race.
TopGear Really love you guys...
TopGear maybe you guys need some advice from mallard 3:30
TopGear definitely one of my favourites
TopGear 5:47 Eloquently put James. XD
TopGear I guess Im the only one here that really doesnt find the 911 to be anything... interesting or special, and certainly not all that pretty.
TopGear You knowIm surprised Top Gear didnt do a drag race between the two acrs. that would have been interesting.
TopGear A love letter to a car.
TopGear Utterly ridiculous. You could get a GT3, Turbo, and a Targa S and still save 50,000.
TopGear I want it so bad........
TopGear Noice !!! Ill buy 4 of them when I win lotto
TopGear When I think of Porsche you think wow
TopGear that is the most beautiful car..... in the world
TopGear other company should do that toothose classic are always the best classics
TopGear Sweet RX7. By far the most beautiful car ever made. The Top Secret S15 is awesome, too(Ive used it in Forza, which is cool)
TopGear Damn asians make everything look easy.
TopGear this video is really old
TopGear That Looks A Lot Like A 2006 Pontiac Gto
TopGear D1 drifters awaaaaayyy
TopGear 3:33 so funny stopit onthe .
TopGear Vauxhall? or he u mean Pontiac GTO?
TopGear finally Top Gear DRIFT!!!
TopGear Makes you wonder if the Stig is watching and feel jelous at the D1 racers drift style.
TopGear it kinda stopped being a mower a long time ago
TopGear That moment you have a honda civic and realize a lawnmower by the same company can go faster....sigh
TopGear Who would cut grasses with that speed?
TopGear The video is in Barcelona (Catalonia).Of Montmelo.:)
TopGear sounds better then modern F1 :D
TopGear Would like to see that go around the Top Gear test track.
TopGear way to dramatic... just show the damn lawnmower already
TopGear Absolutely badass!! You, Doc, are on a roll my friend! Keep them coming.
TopGear WOW! That is INSANELY fast!
TopGear I love this car.What a sound but one question:What us the time lap?.By the way say i love your movies Docta :)
TopGear Very nice content DoctaM3, Im from the philly region and hope to meet you one day at a car event!
TopGear Has always fantastic vids ))
TopGear Looks good with the carbon fiber door painted the same color as the car.
TopGear Io ti seguir comunqueeeeee
TopGear Does anyone else notice that the fan isnt even moving?
TopGear The guy in the middle looks like a morph of Hugh Jackman and David Tennant. Hehe
TopGear The Three Stooges again!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear love the driving, you had to try going up it was the fun thing to do.
TopGear just watched this episode on Netflix. hilarious
TopGear i laughed so hard when he said  my kingdom for a horsepower because the quote actually is  a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse XD
TopGear 8:30 faster than a porch 911 turbo? hes kidding right? lol
TopGear WOW a top gear video I had to actually thumb down that wasnt top gear USA...or wait, it probably was.
TopGear Isnt the entire point of doing laps is to see how cars compare with each other? Why even bother doing a wet lap. Not like you can compare it against dry laps. Wet laps are as pointless as this video.
TopGear Song name? Shazam doesnt wanna work :
TopGear i didnt see the engine?!?
TopGear I like this car for being rare but in all honesty, its pretty slow around the track. I seen an all out battle on a track in japan (japanese racing video) and it got smoked by gtrs , vettes and other stock vehicles..
TopGear What a waste of a video
TopGear Ask anyone who knows how to drive both (well) will tell you that manual transmission is more fun and engaging than paddle shifting. I personally feel that paddle shifting  automatics are only good for city driving because of traffic traffic lights and take away from the driving experience. May be Im too oldschool or maybe I enjoy driving but at this rate electric cars wont even allow you to drive but drive themselves and we just sit for the ride. Until that day I will try and drive a manual transmission car. Easier isnt always better.
TopGear Looks like they went back to an old Celica for some of the design ideas and what is the idea behind the bonnet? The first time I saw one of these cars I thought they hadnt closed it.
TopGear guess the work with VW did pay off for Lamborghini...hope it works for Porsche aswell :D
TopGear How can he see the road aheal?!
TopGear Hes right about the engineers. They need to piss off, and let the car feel and hear natural.
TopGear Love the Lambo, hate the Keystone commercial.
TopGear The Murcielago is my dream car
TopGear Viva espaa!! Y top gear!!
TopGear Well done, cool video! : )
TopGear I never understood that shit. I never will...
TopGear Top Gear 18x02 ITA HD Prima Parte
TopGear Calvin Klein, Android, tough headsets, he has swag
TopGear Since this account has a picture of The Stig, there should be an account with a profile of The Stigs teenage cousin. Just videos of Race the Stig.
TopGear 500 likes 300 views, seems legit :s
TopGear Hahahaha. WTF?????!!!
TopGear Its Alex Brundle! LOLThe Stig has a LOT of damn cousins...
TopGear His headphones are plugged into nothing...
TopGear lol my boss plays that game
TopGear oggi si ritorna indietro? :)
TopGear Check out the E63 AMG around Top Gear track
TopGear From today onward, I will never accept a drag race challenge from someone who claims he will race me with an electric car.
TopGear Hybrids and Electric vehicles. Why do they have to come in hideous colors andor designs? I mean even affordable sedans and SUVs that are available in petrol and hybrid versions have quite a few differences between them the hybrid being the uglier one with ugly tail lights and ridiculous decals and badging.
TopGear Im more curious as to why they would paint it in that ghastly green?..
TopGear Check out the docmovie Pandoras Secret The future of speed is electric and I hope we arent going to burn coal to charge our toys.
TopGear let me beat that electric SLS hold my beer i get my jet.
TopGear Top Gear has obviously never heard of Rimac Concept One electric supercar which has range of 600 km on a single recharge.
TopGear oh snap...sounds to me like the old dog likes an electric....
TopGear TopGear should drive the Rimac Concept One.Its an electric Hypercar with 1,088 hp and 600km of range and costs over 585,000.88 of them are being produced this or next year.
TopGear grazie, sei un grande per tutti gli episodi che hai messo!
TopGear That drag race sounds bad... Late shifting...
TopGear Quando pubblichi l altra?
TopGear I hope they wont ignore one:1 like they did to the Agera R.
TopGear The beauty of Aston resides in that exclusive dashboard.And the thing I like the most is the anti clockwise aluminium revolution rpm meter! Its so unconventional and it excited me so much when I drove a rented one!
TopGear i like music very like please give me that music ()
TopGear its not a 6.0 V12!! its a 5.9 V12. it as always annoyed me.
TopGear Top Gear youre awesome youre the best Motoring show the world and my most favorite show hope to see more and I hope you will continue doing this for a long time sincerely
TopGear Superb. I can go and play top trumps in the pub now.
TopGear Im sorry i like the Aston, but for that kind of money i would rather buy a Ferrari 458
TopGear ThrowbackThursday SushiVSBurger
TopGear I dont know why. but I dont like Lotus at all. its a good little car thoe
TopGear try a 2015 roush mustang vs lotus
TopGear Show me a car that the Mustang CAN beat and I will laugh at both of them.
TopGear As nice as it is to own a mustang, for me, its gotta a 67 mustang or a Shelby ortherwise no thank you! Id take a Lotus cause well for one its gotta a toyota engine  a million times for reliable than a ford engine, plus its just faster and you get more heads turning! Mustangs are just overrated above all other cars
TopGear Give that mustang a modern suspension and it will smoke the plastic car
TopGear Not a very good comparison. Those two cars arent really direct competitors. Id take the lotus but it does cost twice as much.
TopGear Its a British... Sushi?

TopGear you should check out nickgnaime and his brand nosquidding. I think the logo fits!
TopGear Sig. Destruction, la ringrazio vivamente a nome mio e di tutti i fan di Top Gear! Avrei una richiesta da farle,  possibile caricare la puntata india special della 17esima stagione stagione?
TopGear Ciao ma da dove le prendi?:)
TopGear No one expects the Spanish speed humpClassic...They should make a poster out of that.
TopGear My kid dream was owning an Audi, so guess what. R8.. u will be mine someday.
TopGear The most perfect supercar in this day in age is definitely the McLaren
TopGear Id actually buy the Audi R8 ..
TopGear Funny as every episode :D
TopGear Take the Jag, no matter what
TopGear james may got into 3rd 0.0
TopGear See 9:14. Not a very pleasing sight.. front left Tyre is about to burst.
TopGear I cant wait for Richard and Jennifer to bring the P1 and the 918 down to the Top Gear track and see which is the fastest.
TopGear Thank you guys, honestly, for bringing so much entertainment to me. I envy your jobs, despite Im sure they take their toll on your personally, but you all soldier on. Please dont die and cancel the show until after I pass on. kkthxbye!
TopGear im happy with this season and nice to see the new chernobyl sarcophagus coming along nicely
TopGear Top gear is the best tv show ever, i wish it at more episodesfor season.
TopGear the reason this show is still going is because cars are still being made and created every day so no matter what this show will never run out of ideas
TopGear Damned be the day this show ever stops filming. Keep up the good work TG.
TopGear The review of the Jaguar CX75 please... That car is mindblowing good in my opinion
TopGear was the McLaren scene faked?
TopGear Fantastico.....vorrei vedere la prossima puntata se possibile....
TopGear Bravissimo!! Quando la carichi l seconda puntata?
TopGear Magdagdag ng mensahe sa iyong video
TopGear Wonder what Top Gears comments will be about the SLS coming to an end....? Waiting for them to test the SLS Finale Edition....
TopGear I watched it just for her amazing accent.
TopGear 458 is one of the best looking cars of all TIME
TopGear Thats the thing about taking a super car ...theyll probably NEVER catch you  if you DRIVE FAST ENOUGH!...and if you DO get caught, just tell the cops Jeremy said you could take it.
TopGear that accent though , drives me cray cray, in a good way if ya know wa a mean
TopGear Anyone else see the Suzuki Swift?
TopGear Shes one fine looking woman. Talented too.
TopGear What a moron, what a drag
TopGear Koenigsegg Agera R  Swedish Power :D man I love that car :)
TopGear KoenIGsegg not Koenisegg
TopGear I actually hate Aaron Paul.
TopGear He doesnt need the break paddle on my opinion!
TopGear Yeah Bitch!! Laps and shit Yo!
TopGear One of the two two things that Brits do better than USA. Cars and beer.
TopGear Looking forward to it...
TopGear Hi Jennifer Now say you dont like Porsche again,
TopGear another episode of Top Gear and another proof why it has so many fans (myself included). just when you think theyve run out of ideas and it is going to be something predictable (like a simple drag race), they come up with the funniest and coolest ways to spice it up :)
TopGear age has done little to damage to their brains i must say! they are still kids but with expensive toys.
TopGear The audi still looks the best xD
TopGear why is the airport so empty i thought they are supposed to be very busy
TopGear Why is James and Jeremy wearing the same shirt?
TopGear why are jezza and captain slow dressed the same?
TopGear Great video mate, great video!
TopGear Aspettiamo il secondoo!!! )
TopGear The title could be aswell as: Go download adfull game now.
TopGear Topgear did a shit review on the a45
TopGear why have something awesome like the stig and use it for a stupid game .
TopGear looks crap. add stig ghost car data to gt56 and forza and then wake me up.
TopGear You guys should do a simulator app where you get all the cars on the power lap board and make a racing game where you can try and beat the real times or just race with a few friends going around the top gear test track. :D
TopGear so im waiting on the youtube advertising to watch another advertising..
TopGear im downloading that app :D
TopGear BRAWO! tak spartoli klip dzwik tylko na prawym kanale audio pogratulowa.
TopGear Oh my god. It is not that difficult nowadays, to do a very fast car.The rule of doing the speed two ways, is due to the fact, that you could have back wind or driving down a slight slope benefiting factors.And the production numbers? That means, that it is not, tuning one or a couple of cars to the death.The Venom is definitely ridiculous  actually in all ways. But isnt it really a crazy tuning project?Anyway I rather would see myself driving a Bugatti like a BOSS!
TopGear Get it to your thick skulls  Venom GT is not a production car, it has never passed any of the mandatory production car tests like crash, emissions, noise, pedestrian tests, it doesnt have all the mandatory production car safety features etc.They use Lotus VIN plates and register the car as Lotus since Lotus allready is a production car. Might aswell throw a dragster engine into civic and call it fastest production car.
TopGear it will be next Red Line..
TopGear ...And Taylor has exploded.
TopGear holy shit this host is a faggot.....
TopGear So we all know hes not on topgear next week...it was this past sunday...hes the fastest.
TopGear KOENIGSEGG LOOKS SO SEXY AND ITS SO FAST! I LOVE IT!
TopGear Qotd: its obvious that need for speed is
TopGear what amazes me is that usa is  the greatest nation on earth and has SHITY CARS!
TopGear Best  Some Say... of the lot
TopGear A Volvo 300 is greater than 90 of the crap the British ever made.
TopGear Wait what? James has a Mrs?
TopGear The new Stig is Gordon Shedden.
TopGear Theyve got an interesting history if youre into that sorta thing lol.
TopGear That 620R sounds amazing!
TopGear you can see the stigs collar 1:39
TopGear It is called a helmet you wear it in kitcars
TopGear Ohhhh...that looks like fun!
TopGear I WANNA SEE JAMES MAY AND THE STIG BATTLE EACHOTHER IN A RACE!!
TopGear I would love to have one of those!
TopGear Sta meretrice sputa sulla GTR...sono nervoso!!!
TopGear Weird, but I like it....I think.
TopGear Blue Man Group would be really cool to mix into this show, I believe they would fit right in there.
TopGear this is not crazy nor awesome. This is BORING
TopGear It could explode at any moment
TopGear that live show was in the netherlands. i was there
TopGear Pls TopGear CZ (Czech Republick)
TopGear Top gear always brings the original stuff
TopGear Im actually looking for a washing machine at the moment..Which ones has the best power to weight ratio?
TopGear Serbians be mad? War is war people, what side you fought for has nothing to do with you as an individual. You can hate countries, people of a certain nationality in general, but you cant hate specific people over it.
TopGear Those turns were executed wonderfully!
TopGear Why did they bleed of the sky with red?
TopGear i know it was wet last time you came xD
TopGear Mam pytanie czy dwik m235i pochodzi tylko z silnika i wydechu czy jest wspomagany sztucznie ? Bo musz przyzna ,e brzmi bardzo przyjemnie...
TopGear Italian 3english still the best
TopGear I am German but I never watch this in my own language, I like the original English version.By the way, Hammond in Spanish is best.
TopGear spanish sounds like crazy frog
TopGear I couldnt stand watching top gear in non english
TopGear i like the englich and the german languages
TopGear Who needs dubbing when all you need is subtitles
TopGear German! But the BEST ones are the originals, the latest on the Top Gear Chanel on Streetfire!
TopGear hammond in spanish HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!
TopGear That is the most beautiful car Ive ever seen. Coming in just above that Aston DBsomething that James May drove in the race to the Mexican border. Its like a robot and a foodmixer had a baby.
TopGear Im watching this on an iPad
TopGear Why wont you jus put on the kind of helmet that the stig has?
TopGear Actually... Its the combination of Gforce and air causing it. You know G  mg  F  ma  G  ma. In this example Jeremy has a specific acceleration compared to airs mass. So in a way air has also acceleration compared to Jeremy. That plus the fact that air has its mass we can say that G  ma... Sry for not so clear explanation but just think about it...
TopGear All it needs is a fighter jet style cockpit and a bigger engine and it would be perfect
TopGear 0:20The prodigy: First Warning.Yer welcome.
TopGear I dont want to go in to much detail, but let me put it this way: If I was a girl, I would like it very much. hahaha
TopGear Why cant all these countries just let it be in english, in the Netherlands we pretty much always let the audio stay its original language.
TopGear I think German and the normal UK Voice are the best ones
TopGear I usually dont like the dubbings here in Italy but when we talk about Top Gear...I LOVE IT. I cant decide if I love more the english (traditional) version or the italian one (specially when Jeremy talks!!)Love you guysCiao ciao :D
TopGear Great Britains version is the best! Every American knows that US version was a joke.
TopGear Respect From PAKISTAN
TopGear I shat myself laughing at Shanes face when Richard started talking Spanish!
TopGear Spanish is my favorite
TopGear The german translation of Top Gear is crap and thats so I watch the original version
TopGear Spanish (Spain) sucks!!!!! definitely prefer the original version
TopGear Thank God it is subtitled here in Greece, as are most foreign language shows.
TopGear And from here in south Kurdistan translate to kurdish
TopGear What is everyone talking about. An American voice and an English voice ? Its the same language!
TopGear Its not dubbed in American? I feel a bit slighted. I know Jeremy disdains Americans but this is ridiculous.
TopGear MonoMonkey in Spanish. Bac Monkey?
TopGear Oh look guys, its Albert Einstein :D
TopGear Pleas TopGear cz (Czech Republick )
TopGear Probably one of the best conclusion Ive ever seen.
TopGear Jezza you can have your iPAD I would prefer the Mono any day over that iTOY
TopGear Thanks TG! You are my Chicken Soup, especially after a bad day at work, give me LOLs. Really was great when at home for 3 mos after roll over accident (not my fault!) Exciting motor info, laughs  real useful News. 8)
TopGear With all that money, ud think he would have got his teeth fixed.
TopGear Che bello! Grazie a te, riesco a vedere nuovi episodi e non gli stessi che ci rifilano in continuazione su D max. Ti voglio chiedere un cosa: esiste la seconda parte di questo episodio? Grazie ancora, ciaoooo.
TopGear Reminds me of the US MRAP a little bit. This looks sleeker though and I doubt the MRAP goes 70
TopGear Sounds like you put a lot of effort into something that could have been its own episode. Maybe consider releasing a top gear special with behind the scenes footage?
TopGear All I was looking at was that p1
TopGear You know, I know , Everyone knows.
TopGear Afghanistan is where the UK and United States protect our precious oil reserves and say its a matter of stopping the spread of terrorism. Also great vid, but motor trend splattered a Prius with a m1 Abrams and I thought that was  more pleasing to watch.
TopGear I like this guy... Give him Andy Wilmans job.
TopGear Celica chromed in gold... Not a fan of that
TopGear Drag racing implys something else, would this then be called cartography or synchroneous driving?
TopGear THE STIG...........nuff said!
TopGear Top Gear 19 Stagione Episodio 2  Parte 22
TopGear Shame they didnt get Chris Hemsworth on as well  we couldve had Thor vs Loki.
TopGear He likes wind, but he hates thunders.
TopGear Hes so adorable with glasses on :3
TopGear The way he describes Loki as a driver is a perfect description of Jeremy Clarkson...
TopGear Wait!! Loki never would drive a car.
TopGear He would have a tank anxld beibg mad with the tank.
TopGear Gosh shes adorable!!!
TopGear He could just use illusion to get the best time.
TopGear Wow, Mr. May truly took a batter...tips hat
TopGear Shame the BBC edited the guts out of this. Not really worth watching.
TopGear Im kinda surprised the Oracle team is in NZ. Do they normally train here?
TopGear 90 mile beach that is exactly 55 miles LOL
TopGear 5:06 door frame is a red5:31 door frame is a blue.
TopGear does Jeremy have IWC Top Gun? :O
TopGear What then fast car is buggrte. Or towyoter
TopGear So this stig is possibly Norwegian...now to narrow down the possibilities. Maybe he was joking, who knows.
TopGear i bet the new Stig is Mikka Hkinnen
TopGear Looks like the Stig hase some small Boobies..so it could be Sabine Schmitz aswell...:)
TopGear THE STIG IS MIKKA HKINNEN OMG
TopGear Norwegian accentdisinformation,misleading statement...The Stig has lost his neck,now appears to be shorter than he has been in the past...
TopGear meanwhile in top gear usa, the wind blows xD
TopGear Watch a behind the scenes video of this stunt here: INFERNO  Porsche 911 vs Flame Thowers  Top Gear Live
TopGear a burning porche ..... reminds me of paul walker .hope he enjoys his new life in heaven .
TopGear Need the Nickelback song here (Burn it to the ground).
TopGear This video is pretty hot
TopGear I totally believe in setting fire to our lives, 911s included!Good day, mate!
TopGear its very entertaining to watch compared to the dry auto shows that we get in usa and Canada, but the reviews are not correct, still funny to watch though.
TopGear Dear top gear cameraman,stop using slow motion in coming top gear episode.
TopGear This reminds Paul Walker Death.They shouldnt made this video.
TopGear did the car burn to the ground ?
TopGear TheoreticallyHamond drives and Clarkson is the pyro.
TopGear Looks brilliant is slow motion.
TopGear Wait Whaa did he just do!
TopGear Top Gear  Finally saying it like it is
TopGear The word red was written in orange.
TopGear Its funny because it is true.
TopGear This is wonderful! hahahah
TopGear XD ahahaha! beautiful!
TopGear Some traffic lights dont work if you are on a bike. They detect the cars with the sensor, but they dont detect you on a bike, and dont change from red to green.
TopGear This from two guys who treat roads as if they were a playground. Roads are for getting places, tracks are for racing. Topgear...learn the difference.
TopGear The semaphore are god lets obey!
TopGear Drivers. 30 and 40. Learn the bloody difference!
TopGear Omg. They totes made them look younger lol.
TopGear Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond y James May,
TopGear If Dr. D was the next guest star in a reasonably priced car, his name on the board would be Heinz Doooofffeennnnnshhmmmirrrriiiiirrrrrrrttttttttszzzzzzz :P Just like how the spell Koenigsegg.
TopGear aber nur nen TATAdiesel...))
TopGear Herr Lning, wie wre es mal mit einem Video ber Prepper? Sie selbst legen doch auch Vorrte und hnliches fr den Ernstfall an. Mich wrde mal ihre Meinung dazu interessieren, in Amerika scheint es weit verbreitet zu sein.
TopGear personally i think thats one of the best PIFs ive ever seen....it gets the point accross in a hard sharp way....1010 to the lads for this
TopGear This is one of your best vids
TopGear Archie if you ever come down south (Adelaide ways) I would love to have a drink with you and chat about watches!
TopGear I cant believe that theres no mention of an Oris in that magazine.....
TopGear Wow archie in Fire :) love ur comic sense :)
TopGear Classic rant  nice one, Archie! Pretty impressive to sustain a rant like that over 10 minutes. Go play with your sandtray now.
TopGear Actually not as bad as most mens magazines watch recommendations. At least there were some priced for less than 1K. Sometimes its all 10k fashion watches.
TopGear if you think a GM V8 is cheap and nasty, you havent driven a Corvette

TopGear You guys r so stupid, its cuz stallions get exxcited just like humans do, dont u ever get a boner?
TopGear i wanna see the Full James May bycycle maintenance video
TopGear Wankers! The tags were left on to make them, as cyclists, look stupid. I bet JC even suggested they wear their helmets backwards! JC whinged about his arse cause, after realising how fast it is to get from WC2 to W1 on a bike he couldnt think of anything negative to say about biking around London. Isnt it strange how in the final cut they never showed Tweedles Dee and Dum passing the 3040 cars which EVERY cyclist does when they go biking through London for twenty minutes.How long did it take JC to stop, park up and get his scotum sorted? 30secs on a bike, fuck knows how long that would take in a car. But he wouldnt get sore balls in a car, so there. I hear you carlovers say. Yeah, yeah, whatever. The bloke is such a lard, he gets sore balls waiting behind a bus in his 125,000 6.3litre AMGengorged penis.Please search out Stewart Lee, Why I hate Top Gear for a somewhat accurate appraisal of the Tweedles.
TopGear Getting worst every year
TopGear Toothpaste on your scrotum? I thought I was the only one...!
TopGear Sharing this rather funny TopGear episode ...
TopGear LOL I saw this episode yesterday.
TopGear I use my bicycle everyday. Going to school, training and nearly everywhere else by bicycle. If you do that and for one day e.g your parents drive you to school with their car you realize what a luxury this is... :D
TopGear I love the last part where they build the bridge on River Kok
TopGear what name song from 2:18 ?

TopGear Its full hd images from Top Gear series21 episode05. The one with the Porsche 918. I have the full video also but naturally posting the full hour long episode would break copyright laws. :)
TopGear Another boring episode of plain stupidity.
TopGear I thought my trip, by Atlantic City Rail Line, Riverline, Riverline And Bus 407 to the Moorestown Community House, for the Moorestown High School 35th Reunion... and back... was interesting... Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May on their final part of their journey  to Chernobyl in Ukraine, with only their cars as protection against troubling levels of radiation.
TopGear what happened to Jeremy and James?
TopGear try taping the air filter half way
TopGear Jeezer, Hamster, and Slowly are the Three Horsemen of the Apocalypse! They go to Syria, the place immediately breaks out into civil war! They go to Ukraine. World War III is about to start there! Stay in Britain, Top Gear, before you kill us all!
TopGear Song starting at about 4:50 ???
TopGear Good job  well done to Hammond!!!! The look on Jeremys face was priceless...
TopGear Their cars are the colour of the Russian flag
TopGear 6:26  why was he only at 1500RMP??? what happened to the 6200RPM tactic
TopGear Like that very much. How much?
TopGear In conclusion: this car is FREAKING AWESOME!!!

TopGear in your face hummer !!!
TopGear Funny.... Also awesome hehehe :P
TopGear That must have been a practice lap. for how fast his wet lap times normally are, that was really bad on some of those corners.
TopGear One hand steering trough the rain with a car as fast as a lightning bolt, this is incredible! What a true legend!
TopGear Getting a drivers lesson from Top Gear  Id be terrified. Im like Jack, I quit my driving lessons because my teacher kept shouting at me
TopGear What happened to the cool wall?!!! I saw it last episode.

TopGear Please visit the Philippines guys and try driving the jeepney in Manila
TopGear things to come? drones attacking cars?
TopGear The car was offthrottle most of the time even on the followthrough Stig had to use the brakes.The way I see it is this  all the power in the world is useless unless you can control it and put it into good use.
TopGear He never went any higher than 3rd gear! Get that car on a dry track, I absolutely love it! (even if it spontaneously catches fire!)
TopGear you have to test it in the dry you stupid idiots! you would not be satisfied if this was a bugatti veyrons lap because everyone wants to know a dry time and not a wet!
TopGear Looks hard to drive.but i guess is fun
TopGear What Top Gear didnt say: unofficially the fastest car on their straight (300 kmh), 060 in 2.6 sec in a car with manual gear and rear wheel drive. The car cant put down more than 400 hp in those conditions. And as for the fire: even highly engineered Porsches catches on fire these days... Just felt like defending my countries only car :)
TopGear After watching s21 ep4 now you know its normal for supercars to go on fire
TopGear The weather conditions look horrible for a car that has 1000 hp. I guess the Zenvo isnt the easiest car to drive either.
TopGear As soon as I heard the music I jumped straight to my computer to see if it was real or if I was just imagining it :)
TopGear If while youre driving this car you start hearing voices in your head drive it off a cliff, because you just got indoctrinated! If it turns into a squid shaped killer robot  run for your pitiful life :P
TopGear Im Commander Shepard and this is my favorite vehicle.
TopGear you know what this means....half life 3 confirmed?
TopGear Bet you a 6x6 after hes seen it, he went on to buy one for himself too.
TopGear I like the design Top Gear  Richard Hammond gets stopped by a Lamborghini Aventador Police Car
TopGear yes offcourse we can do that, in times that oil is plenty!!! NOT
TopGear I want to be a police man in Dubai now.
TopGear James what are you doing?
TopGear Still, could be worse..
TopGear I rather have the jet ski
TopGear I just watched it on tv
TopGear Top Gear has 100 Jumped The Shark! This is such a far cry from what made the show great. Compare this crap to the Audi A8 single tank of fuel from 10 years ago. Time to hit reset button Boys.
TopGear 4:04Thats the most perfect impersonation of Clarkson I have EVER seen in my ENTIRE life!!! XD XD XD
TopGear Fuck theyve dumbed this show down over the years. It used to feel spontaneous and fun, and unscripted even though it probably was. Now they treat their audience like theyre total fucking morons!
TopGear Omgawsh Tamanna is soo perfect
TopGear I would want the Fendt tbh...
TopGear TOP GEAR go to croatia
TopGear Man that fendt is worth more then a honda ciciv wow
TopGear So, whats the big deal again?
TopGear His whole face is red! lol
TopGear From the inside it doents seems dat fast...
TopGear Some say he sucks the moisture from ducks. And that he knows two facts about them, both of which are wrong.
TopGear Its not raining? Its always raining! British thing I guess...
TopGear Thats what I want to see on TV...
TopGear Really disappointed that they didnt show anything but that bloke babbling! I wanted to see army vehicles, dam wish I had read the fomments before I watched! When is the program going to be on T.V in Canada?
TopGear FYI BRITISH PEOPLE GET TO WATCH TOP GEAR ON SUNDAYS NOT MONDAYS LIKE YOU YANKS
TopGear lol noone even cares about the alfa.ima go with the quadski
TopGear richard looks like ironman hero.
TopGear I was there. :) Its missile base near Pervomaysk in Ukraine.
TopGear Where do you get the clips
TopGear bless him he hadda terrible day for it but made the best of it!!! well done tom
TopGear Loki in a reasonable price car!
TopGear Did he just say Mark Wahlberg at the end??????
TopGear Hilarious, but poor Hugh! I actually think hes quite dashing in his woolly jumper!
TopGear Shame on the BBC for showing this vile piece of shit last night. Its a fucking disgrace.

GameSack I have it on good authority she is pursuing an offer to do a full spread in Penthouse. Naturally this didnt sit well with LoL execs so away she goes.
GameSack What was that... 113 devided by 1? Lets see what the calculator has to say about that :D
GameSack 6:37 Picks and Bans 14:36 Game starts

GameSack 2000 gold in 3 seconds
GameSack Berzerkers suck on renekton, he isnt rightclicker.
GameSack After all thats done then buy some elixers and there ya go lol. Oh and early on I think you should get oracles before building your quick silver sash if the enemy team has a lot of stealth. believe it or not this actually worked pretty well for me. we were pushed into our base turrets and i had to carry the morons doing this build....good thing they had akali vayne and lux. 3 easy kills lol. One last thing id like to mention is the skilling order. I think it should be e before w, its just.
GameSack you guys are talking about  10 mins into watch?vzlhMvbUwQfeaturerelated right?
GameSack LOL kill the shopkeeper
GameSack lol who would dislike this?
GameSack thats prob the dumbest ive read in a long long time....
GameSack thats prob the dumbest ive read in a long long time....
GameSack Ventrilo is not worse than skype. Ventrilo chat is hosted on a foreign server, which makes it a lot easier on your Internet than Skype.
GameSack I see someone likes Ventrilo.
GameSack on the 2013 on march. u cant attack or click on the pool turret. its deal 1000 true damage per hit, ignores all armour and magic resistance, tyrn ulti and all the other champions abilties and spells.
GameSack Pro way to win is play pantheon or TF so you can ult into base and BD the shit outa the enimies during a team fight when you have 2 tanks and support champs just slowly taking and healing any damage. Its fun to BD on noobs. Won a game by pushing a tower, inhib, and last 2 towers all in a minute on Sivir, cleared all their enimies super easily p
GameSack DragOzze i got there before LOL. well if the games go on long, get full stack mejai Soul Stealer, and yeah i got to like 900 when iuse elixer of brilliance it wentup to 1k AP XD
GameSack i watched half the video, and all i saw was a noob that somehow got 20 stacks then tried to make a video and ended up losing almost all his stacks, and playing really bad, had to close the video to not suffer anymore.
GameSack yes it did you fucking noob. Ive played for 2 years and rabadons has always been available

TopGear Oh look, another pack full of cars from FM4.
TopGear April car pack lol! I got it today!
TopGear Lmfao at T10, what a joke.
TopGear Wow this pack is kinda gay add something nice like 79 skyline ke70 s14 Honda integra and re add rims like work equip 03
TopGear Was leaked in forums few days ago :p
TopGear Available April the 1st? I already have these cars and can use them? eh?
TopGear the graphics looks like REAL LIFE!!
TopGear 10 cars built for the next generation!...9 of which were in Forza 4... and 5 of which were in Forza 3...
TopGear So pedestrian. A real Top Gear car pack would have such vehicles as the Alfaab or Geoff.
TopGear i have the new cars a ready and all the cars that you have with pack i will be given to people for free one car of each if you want to see them sent me a massage to beauliexqc
TopGear The cars look so realistic its amazing.
TopGear shame on you turn ten

TopGear Reminds me of the KKND 2 soundtrack :)
TopGear To be honest nick I had the app since like December from last year and I live in California USA so it took time to spread over there :)
TopGear Uh Nick I hate to bust your bubble but this game is like 6 months old
TopGear Why dont u just record while playing???
TopGear Finaly, you decided to use SAAB 93, looking foward to see how my car is going to be on the track in Forza 4 :)

TopGear Top Gear race the Stig on Android
TopGear how it can be Best Sedan Challenge when two cars are coupes
TopGear okay guys, why level the playing field? This is supposed to be a test between them, they should be totally stock...
TopGear I am going to the nfs film in 5 minutes so excited
TopGear but nick... the c63 is a sports coupe not a sedan...
TopGear Hey guys, just watching over the video and i didnt know my mic was playing up so im sorry about that, i will get it sorted! :)
TopGear Oddly enough, the graphics are the one thing I remember most about the game. The car reflections were neat.
TopGear They did make a 599 convertible, its called the SA Aprenta and is extremely rare and expensive
TopGear the fastest car is the mclaren
TopGear Its Lexus or Mercedis Benz who has two reverse gears
TopGear The unimog has 2 rev gears
TopGear You should do this on horizon because it has 458 spider and r8 gt spider
TopGear The Ferrari is 1:19.1
TopGear The mclaren sounds like the hover bike from jak and daxter
TopGear more the same...subway
TopGear That drag race, the vacca is RWD while the adder and elegy are AWD, it was inevitable off the line
TopGear Very very good video! More please !
TopGear You didnt give me credit for the challenge idea :(
TopGear Thank you for taking my request on the super ram ToastyMustard
TopGear You need to make a R35 drift car!!!
TopGear Try getting big air with the caterham because its superlight
TopGear All the talking at the same time is kinda annoying
TopGear Hey, do you know if this can be done in Forza 4?
TopGear When u do challenges next live stream do a audi rs4 plz
TopGear xbox record that...xbox record that...xbox record that...xbox record that...xbox record that LOOOOOOOOOL
TopGear Not the best N64 racer, but it was certainly a fun game, especially with friends.
TopGear wow the graphics look pretty good for a N64 game, I never heard of this one before... are there any hiccups in multiplayer or does it play smoothly?
TopGear Wow this channel needs more subs
TopGear Why making a Gran Turismo like game for the N64 would never be impossible?N64 actually had some racing simulators, like some F1 games. In fact, in the 90s, if you wanted to play a F1 racing game simulator, you would need to buy a N64, because the PS1 just couldnt handle those games. The best ones were on the N64.Theres also World Driver Championship, which is a simulator just like Gran Turismo and, in terms of visuals and technology, is also far superior to any other racing game at the time.
TopGear Non potrei MAI annoiarmi!!!!...adoro questo tag!!!!....comunque AMO alla follia le galantine ...verissima la affermazione ke hai fatto...solo ki ha avuto un animale pu capire... :( un bacione grande!

GameSack They still havent been banned, and I got my free unchained alistar skin.
GameSack Excellent point, i would like to donate that money for you to get a nose job. You have a jew nose.
GameSack The contributors of the project should each be compensated. Why? Because they are investors...and investors should collect from what they invest in..especially when its not possible without them.
GameSack Kickstarter: theres strict rules about how the extra money can be used... its outlined right in the agreement
GameSack I dont know if you remember Will but at the start of this yearend of last year you predicted that RWJ would pass RyanHiga interms of Subscribers, and you were spot on. And a couple of videos ago you predicted that Freddiew might surpass RWJ. I think you are going to be right once again considering what freddiew is doing atm.
GameSack JamesBerg86 thx! will do!
GameSack Your production value has increased quite a bit. I would like to suggest you try different micing. Record your sound in a different way.
GameSack What about Phil, he does giveaways every single video.
GameSack s5w6 Its different. Riotgames have the power to advertise on basically ANY gaming site, where millions of people can see them. And within those advertisements, they can promote the subscription to their Youtube channel to gain this free Alistar Skin. Phillip Defranco and Toby do not have that capability, and their giveaways is purely by chance, not a guarantee, and the only way for you to know about the giveaway, is to actually watch their stuff.
GameSack jennamarbles is awesome !
GameSack Will is an ampersand...
GameSack Whaaa? Shira whatchu talking bout? Im Canadian and I pronounce it Mario, (the right way).
GameSack eznoob1v1 no he is not gay . he just laughs funny and moves his hands alot , thats all
GameSack Great now I gotta find spbadbuys comment

GameSack tanner1ie Blame the Italians with American pronounciation.
GameSack zuperzekrom same excel spreadsheet but much better room! lol
GameSack Will you are so amazing!!!! :D
TopGear HE WAS REFERRING TO THE BRIDHE YOU FUCKING SLOPE!!!!!
TopGear I do see a slope and it is a little ugly one too.
TopGear Wow. This brings back memories. I was 14 when some kid from another school called me a filthy slope (Im Chinese btw) playing soccer. My mate (big Caucaisan kid) jumped in, called him a fucking racist and threatened to rip his head off if he opens his mouth again. I thanked him on the bus trip back but had to ask, Graham...whats a slope? Ive been called chink and gook but never slope.This was 1995...and pretty much the only time in my life anyone used slope on me. Surely in 2014 its expired as a slur :)  Also 1.8 million?....Its a little cheeky but 1.8 Million for a silly little punjoke thats not even aimed at your own demographic??
TopGear I dont know why shes so upset, slopes are eastern Asians. Being an Indian would make her a Jobbycatching Currymuncher.
TopGear that is a placard for hazmat shipments. his is a class 1 division 1.3 for mass fire hazard.
TopGear Mate whats with the gay voice changer?! Ruiins the hole video!!
TopGear There was a darker history for the Challenger... It was a Mitsubishi at one time... Heres the deal, these are not Muscle cars, Muscle Cars are Charger RT, Ford Torino Cobra, Chevelle SS 396454 and 90 were automatics, I too would prefer a manual but that was not the norm for Muscle Cars, these are Pony Cars, always have been always will be.
TopGear yeahh the videos are in good quality but the voices not so much. what happen to the voices??????
TopGear I want to know what the crew was driving to break the trail ahead of you. I highly doubt they were in another van. lol
TopGear Poor saab :( rip 99 dark blue 3dr viggen.
TopGear i love top gear uk this is rubbish
TopGear Why do they keep making it sound like everything they do is dangerous its obviously not or els they wouldnt be doing it. Fucking american pussys
TopGear I would have the tank which Richard Hammond (Hamster) used and a Toyota Hilux
TopGear Why is the sound dropped an octave?
TopGear Theyre voice is changed its not theyr normal voice
TopGear Why do they show the sky
TopGear Ok. Sooooo this 100,000 car is the way of the future, and Im supposed to be enamored to buy one? Even with the 10k government rebate, its still 40k more than the truck I want. So lets see. 40,0003.70 a gallon is 10,811 gallons of gas that I can buy for my truck. Thats 338 full tanks, or appx 172,000 miles, which the way I drive will last me about 5 12 years, thus paying off the truck and getting a new one at that point. That 100k car, which Ill never be able to afford wouldnt save me enough in electric bills over the fuel for my trucks in my lifetime. So they can kiss my country boy redneck ass, and shove that 100k electric car of the future where the petrol dont shine. Ill take my 4x4s any day. Besides, living in western NY in the snow belt, Id love to see that little POS get through our winters without getting towed. Stupid aholes that live in the heat build cars based on where they live and expect the world to acclimate??? HA!!!
TopGear Whats with their voices
TopGear The kuttless is the best
TopGear Ill get the toyota rather than any of those
TopGear my 91 powerwagon has over 300k miles on it and has original motor and tranny. never owned a ford or chevy but my dodge is still running strong
TopGear 2nd subscriber! yay me
TopGear Yes please! But dont vertical film again
TopGear Are the respective pilots aware of this race? Loving it. Tweets cheering my day up no end. But Champagne and hula hoops?
TopGear Better than nothing I say.
TopGear WORK HARDER. lol i bicyclist hit my mirror so i kicked his spokes in. here in new mexico the law is give bikers 3 feet. if they would give me three feet i wouldnt have a broken mirror. i need a truck to run em over
TopGear Nice speakers Chenobyl is a scary place
TopGear Get in the cockpit of a MercedesBenz SLS GT3 race an E63 V8 at the Sydney Motorsport Park.
TopGear llllloooooll the end where the nissan gtr goes
ZONEofTECH I use my iPod nano 6th gen as a watch!
ZONEofTECH I like it it would be awesome
ZONEofTECH how is it going to fit different wrist size????
ZONEofTECH why not use all of the types of charging that he mentioned
ZONEofTECH I hate how people are so worried about battery life. You charge your phone every night, is it that hard to just plug a cord in along with your phone?
ZONEofTECH Ok Im gonna say it. Dude you look so much like the actor Andrew Garfield. He played in The SocialNetwork and The Amazing Spiderman
ZONEofTECH i think it will turn out shit
ZONEofTECH I want to see on the Apple iWatch I want to see people calling each other and possibility txt on it idk maybe
ZONEofTECH NOTE The iWatch  Final Leaks  Rumors video is taking a lot longer to edit, than expected. This means that I will most probably upload it this Wednesday so stay tune for that. That video shouldve been uploaded before this one but since its Monday, I had to upload something for you and this one was a bit quicker to edit(still spent 14h :)
ZONEofTECH number 3 is more realistic in my oppinion
ZONEofTECH On 3 it said Oktober not october
ZONEofTECH fave was number 2, it was PHUCKING AMAZING!...but the problem with number 1 is, how do you adjust the size of the watch for large or small wrists?
ZONEofTECH there is a problem with the concepts... wheres the headphone jack?
ZONEofTECH Numbers 1 and 3 looked pretty cool
ZONEofTECH Last year I was looking at phones nuber 2 poped up and I staerted rumers at school. Lol
ZONEofTECH Usually dont post comments or videos on this account usually do it on MetalsnakeMC but check out the 4th on this video
ZONEofTECH I only believe 1 will actually happen
ZONEofTECH The auxiliary port for the headphones on number 1 is the only problem
ZONEofTECH No.4 is the craziest iP concept ever, they should design the special pants with very deep pocket for it.LOL
ZONEofTECH is this the guy from amazing spiderman
ZONEofTECH Because apple didnt have screen cracking issues before. Now they are going with a stiffer, more brittle display. Which means that as soon as it touches anything, its just going to spontaneously blow out
ZONEofTECH You mean aluminum ? Lmao
ZONEofTECH He looks a lot like Drake Bell.
ZONEofTECH How many times have you guest the right thingg
ZONEofTECH He looks so much like Andrew Garfield lol
ZONEofTECH I need to get a joooobbbbb
ZONEofTECH i like androids, but i prefer apple. no hate for either side. cant we all just get along?
ZONEofTECH Wtf is this? Opera or a tech event? Samsung has lost the plot, honestly!!On the side note, when is Samsung starting to recruit the 2014 shills? It appears that this is a good place to start. Is gonna need it with the HTC one coming soon. And god help Samsung when iPhone 6 comes )
ZONEofTECH Why the heck did i get a 5s!? Big mistake. Apple is crapple. Going back to the better side soon:)
ZONEofTECH 18:50 to skip all the bullshit
ZONEofTECH Very good info Dan I sure like your vidz. I like that you also added the fact that Apple usually take stuff from other companies and make it thire own because I know some iSheeps will say that Samsung are stelling from them!Lets see on Monday if your predictions are correct :)
ZONEofTECH Can someone tell me what time will unpacked5 be at e.s.t?
ZONEofTECH you look like the new peter parker in amazing spiderman
ZONEofTECH Over 10 hours of editing and this is the result!Samsung Galaxy S5, Galaxy Gear 2 and the NEW Galaxy Tab 4 :)
ZONEofTECH I think Samsung probably wanted to see the market reaction to the new product and the high price was to keep people away from buying the product and only a few people would actually buy it.
ZONEofTECH BIG DEAL .... UMMA BLACKBERRY LOVER ... IPHONE 1 ,2 3,4 ,5, now 6,7 ... HOW BORING ... SAME SHIT JES A COUPLE NEW FEATURES DIFFERENT SIZE SAME SHAPE .... BLACKBERRY HAS A NEW ASIAN CEO JOHN CHEN ..... WHO IS GOING TO PUSH BLACKBERRY TO THE NEXT LEVEL ... (the leak is hopeless jes to get these Iphone ppl pumped up ..

ZONEofTECH How do you know what it looks like
ZONEofTECH apple is to scared to change the model
ZONEofTECH i got a awsome family for christmas!
ZONEofTECH I dont celebrate Christmas, but I did download Ni no Kuni (which is a HUGE 21.7GB file!), so I guess that counts, haha.

ZONEofTECH What do you use to emulate Windows ?
ZONEofTECH Nice helped me out quite a lot
ZONEofTECH The box is flat to match the new design of iOS 7
ZONEofTECH I have a early 2011 13 Macbook Pro with 2.3 GHz i5 and 16 GB ram plus a 256 GB SSD My Geekbench 64 bit was 6657. I compared it with a couple of 13 retinas and I was on par with them. Their scores were 6724, 6695, 6627.
ZONEofTECH Hi just wondering if you knew If I could upgrade my Graphic CardSSD without voiding my warranty and apple care?
ZONEofTECH Im watching this on my 5c
ZONEofTECH my setup:the first mac pro4g ram20g on the hole hard drive 00intel core 2
ZONEofTECH cool I have a 11inch mac book air
ZONEofTECH hey mice video but u said something about old pc would u be able to give it to me for free or maybe 50
ZONEofTECH You provide such good content. I dont understand why you dont have a crazy amount of subscribers.
ZONEofTECH Mmmmm maybe its a bit too pricey
ZONEofTECH iOS7, so much for simplistic light weigh 64bit based OS
ZONEofTECH 17 seconds is the fastest boot time I have seen so far.
ZONEofTECH How about nexus 5 vs Xperia Z1
ZONEofTECH Samsung galaxy s4 vs Nexus 5
ZONEofTECH Wow that blew my mind xD
ZONEofTECH Whats the music at the end
ZONEofTECH Hey what a coincidence Im also Romanian. Ce faci? Haha
ZONEofTECH Haha sorry bud you dont have an american accent at all.... very obviously European
ZONEofTECH The part about the iPhone 5 Black  Slate scuffing, my friend has a black  slate model, and she has like, AWFUL scuffs on it, I actually thought she dropped it or something. But she said her case did it, so I believe it happens due to cases.
ZONEofTECH The language before the chinese is japanese :) it says konnichiwa
ZONEofTECH Happy Halloween (which I never learnt to celebrate)
ZONEofTECH U should do a video of u using the dual flash
ZONEofTECH video: review how to use your fingerprint when its locked on the iphone 5s
ZONEofTECH Definitely the iPad Air makes it for me out of all the Appple announcements. Im still nursing my Ipad 1 and have been waiting for a serious reason to upgrade and I think the Air does it! Thanks for the informed synopsis.
ZONEofTECH Why does the description say S4?
ZONEofTECH I dont have that vodafone on my phone and it pop up at 25 secs
ZONEofTECH Price for the case has gone up to 9.95

ZONEofTECH Ps3 pls! Imma help sprea your channel!i love your vids
ZONEofTECH i would want GTA 5 on Playstation 3
ZONEofTECH Apple is originalsamsung copy fake
ZONEofTECH NEW VIDEO!iPhone 5C vs iPhone 4S FULL Benchmarks and Speed test!
ZONEofTECH Seriously, you look so much like Andrew Garfield! (Peter Parker from The Amazing SpiderMan)
ZONEofTECH Its not fear comparison since the iOS 7 was not made to speed up 4s, make a video with both devices on the first iOS they had, that will be fear, and iPhone 4S on iOS 5 was extremely fast even better than iphone 5s on iOS 7
ZONEofTECH I think that the 4s has an advantage over the others because it just looks BEAST where as the iphone 5 5c and 5s look like shit because of the metal baclate
ZONEofTECH I have the iPhone 5S in gold
ZONEofTECH Send me a free one then ?
ZONEofTECH This quite a pointless comparison with the only difference being IOS 7 instead of IOS 6. We all know the iPhone 5C beats the 4S quite comfortably in every speed test this guy did. Personally I would get the 5S.. I have a 4S currently and its beginning to show its age since the IOS 7.0.4 update.
ZONEofTECH my 4s started in 19 seconds?
ZONEofTECH Whos the woman TALKING IN THE BACKGROUND ?
ZONEofTECH cant wait to get my 5s a gold one (
ZONEofTECH I would just love that iPhone 5c I cant stop thinking about it
ZONEofTECH BLACK AND GREEN IS AWESOME
ZONEofTECH thanks for posting this, cant wait until mine shows up in the mail.

ZONEofTECH Grady 5 got it yesterday
ZONEofTECH Whats with the Display ? Full HD ?
ZONEofTECH Its not the number of cores that matter. However, the Lumia 925 is far behind the S4 in term of performance. Animation on WP can be smoother, but thats it. Gaming on the 925 is not as good even though it has a 720p (vs 1080p on the S4). App launching is not as fast as on the S4 either.:)
ZONEofTECH by the way.,nice humor about that seal :D
ZONEofTECH Well i like the s4 but samsung needs to lay off the plastic
ZONEofTECH Blue FTW If theres no blue,than some other color,i dont care! :)I hope i win,it would be awesome. Ive done it all,shared it,subscribed to you,liked the video,liked you on facebook,shared it on twitter,facebook and google . I hope i winn! :D

ZONEofTECH I kinda like the 5C, would consider buying it although Id love the 5S, but may be outta my price range. the specs for the C were better than i was even owing. The white 5C would be the only one Id consider though not so keen on the colors. Thanks for the video man, good work )
ZONEofTECH iphone 8 will release in septmeber 2018.
ZONEofTECH Well.. Im kindda interested now on iphone because i was an android user for how many years now.. Its great but i just want something for change and hopefully if i upgraded or change my fone to iphone hopefully i wontt be dissappointed.. Thanks for the summary of the apple event.. More power!!

ZONEofTECH Id like the football, please c:
ZONEofTECH im geting that phone for birthday
ZONEofTECH in the video...its just an iphone 5 with white hardcase
ZONEofTECH No, it doesnt. The plastic is good quality. It makes it look kind of futuristic.

ZONEofTECH You dont need RecBoot. Hold down both the top (power) button and the home button for 10 seconds, then after 10 seconds, let go of the top power button and keep holding the home button down for 8 seconds. That puts your phone into recovery mode.
ZONEofTECH Did you get an answer? or resolve your issue?

ZONEofTECH JUST WAIT IT COMES OUT ON THE 18Th
ZONEofTECH i have iphone4, can i install ios7 beta 5 free...?
ZONEofTECH The Iphone     could not be updated because the firmware file is not compatible. WTF dose that mean?
ZONEofTECH you do realize the htc one has a smaller screen so thats why it has more ppi... if the galaxy s4 would have been 4.7 inch its wouldv had the same ppi
ZONEofTECH How can i change the pictures of the artists?
ZONEofTECH Nah man, this looks like shit
ZONEofTECH I have an iphone 4 but i dont have itunes radio can someone help me please
ZONEofTECH I absolutely hate the new music app. The old one works just fine... I wish they hadnt overhauled it.
ZONEofTECH i have am 4th gen ipod D:
ZONEofTECH Specs and data are all on Apples site for the public to see. Compare that to the previous gen Mac Pro or the system of your choice and then youll know.
ZONEofTECH They wouldnt be as big as they are if they were making bad business moves. This computer is lightyears ahead of anything else on the market
ZONEofTECH HA AHHAAH YEDSSSSSSSSS SUCK IT!1
ZONEofTECH How is this a demo and review? Ugh.
ZONEofTECH Sure, cause when you told Eve to bite the Apple it worked so well for all of us ...
ZONEofTECH Its not working on my Macbook Pro (2010) with my IP5 running iOS 7 beta... Nothing shows up when both are on...
ZONEofTECH What an unuseful video. Still have no idea what it is...
ZONEofTECH Still i enjoy watching Apple fans at keynotes that are so excited at everything Apple throws at them :)
ZONEofTECH Except after 3 years and numerous devices with NFC, mobile NFC usage is nearly nonexistent in pretty much everywhere.
ZONEofTECH id much rather bump my phone with others than making sure ALL my friends are on the same OS version as me, and have my account ID or whatever. AirDrop is so much more complicated than NFC...but just watch, Apple will include NFC in the next iPhone (whatever theyll call it, and will call it I Beam LOL
ZONEofTECH Lol idc if you use it :P
ZONEofTECH Los de Apple si que tienen webos para copiar calcar a WebOS
ZONEofTECH Webos my favorite mobile os
ZONEofTECH Pulls web search results from Bing I dont agree with that. but I do like the new siri voice, it was a joke before.
ZONEofTECH Djhey20 I agree I live how it sounds live a human .. Its like you have a real personal assistant .
ZONEofTECH it would be awesome if the iphone 4 and ipod touch wold be able to use siri. the devices are clearly compatible.
ZONEofTECH Is it going to be realesed for iPhone 4? If not im going to samsung...
ZONEofTECH Please i want it pleaseee im begging
ZONEofTECH Yes I would very much like the iPod please:)
ZONEofTECH I have the 64 gigs iPod touch its awesome :)
ZONEofTECH so wait do u think the 4th generation iPod is kinda better cuz of the back camera or not
ZONEofTECH It always makes me download the game again and it takes dick long
ZONEofTECH it disappear every times i press it
ZONEofTECH Hey mates. I offer you this site just to help you! I am representing you the only website for getting free Riot codes .RpPointsCodes.om All gift codes are checked, they really work
ZONEofTECH Can u download this in SEA server in mac?
ZONEofTECH Haha I know, I have a cold :P which made me speak like Batman.
ZONEofTECH Watch this q5yhQiXzYL8 Still has batterys
ZONEofTECH This controller is wirelesswired. Plugging in the cable will send data via the cord rather than wireless and when not plugged in the data is sent wireless.
ZONEofTECH YOU COULD BEEN CHARGE IT WHENEVER YOU WANTED IF YOU HAD A BATTERY PACK WHICH CAME WITH MY XBOX 360
ZONEofTECH you dont know what the ps4 looks like though.
ZONEofTECH This is as good as YOUTUBE ONE! and we all know thats really good
ZONEofTECH HAHAHAHA! Theyre already underpowered compared to gaming PCs and they arent even out!
ZONEofTECH You actually showed the process of picking the winner, respect for that, and a thumbs up.
ZONEofTECH 1st one!!! But not too many features!! Just keep it classy!!!
ZONEofTECH Im not updating if its flat
ZONEofTECH I dont want iPhone to look like windows phone
ZONEofTECH i hop the new OS will not be TO flat, its not really beautyfull to see that
ZONEofTECH ios update? on android u can use many homescreen replacement (launcher) like this homescreen
ZONEofTECH Definitely like number 1 :)) xD
ZONEofTECH My thinking: 5thSUCKS, 4thLOVE!, 3rdLOVE IT! :3, 2ndBLAH, 1stBEST ONE :3
ZONEofTECH Hey, I watched your money youtube video, and I have a question. If I make money, and youtube decides to give it to me, do they send me an email, asking for my P. O. Box ?? Plz respond. I need help
ZONEofTECH You know that specs on I phones are rubbish. Its just that theyre heavily optimized to perform smoothly. 300 is expensive for a poorly specd and quality phone. My xperia sp is 300 pounds New and its specs wise better and has a massive illumination bar
ZONEofTECH X.X I cant even afford this one :c
ZONEofTECH 99 bucks where I live
ZONEofTECH No its not :) At least I dont think so. A lot of tech websites have posted this, including MacRumors, 9to5Mac, theVerge and so on. So I think its actually legit. Anyway, well have to wait and see for ourselves.
ZONEofTECH Na Im staying with IPhone 5.
ZONEofTECH Its gonna be called a iPhone 5c not mini
ZONEofTECH I recently ordered an iPhone 5 from this website gegoshop.co.uk , shipping took a bit longer but their prices are extremely low LOOOL
ZONEofTECH Yeah, I know. They also had the note which is quite huge. I guess in 5 years Samsung will be like: Today, were announcing the new Samsung Galaxy Mini, our smallest smartphone with a really pocketable screen size of 8 inches
ZONEofTECH Best Video in Youtube !
ZONEofTECH Great Review! looking at buying the Samsung galaxy S3 Mini, and now you have fully convinced me. I dont know which color to! I liked the red one as well as the white! Help me decided? :)
ZONEofTECH S3 Mini The Best Phone
ZONEofTECH Thx for quick answer. Ive already shared it on my facebook and liked it . So , with all the info you know about s4 mini , would you consider it as a lot better device than s3 mini? and how will it cost in the beggining? so if for example costs smth like 450500 euro i will definitely buy s3 mini now and see about the s4 mini next year.. so my only downsides with the s3 mini are cam , processor ( and PPI but no so much for that ).So it worth to wait? P.S : size of the phone? dont want big one.
ZONEofTECH iPhone 4S. I dont like Samsung products.
ZONEofTECH The price of s g s3 mini is 230 and the iphone is 320 so it mean that 8 gb is 230 and the iphone is 16 gb 320 is 2302and that is 460 with 16 gb so the s3 wins the price
ZONEofTECH Thank you Paul :) I am glad I was able to help you and your wife. Be sure to like this video, share it with your friends and SUBSCRIBE to my channel for more EPIC video :) Cheers! Dan
ZONEofTECH Thank you for your reply Alec, Unfortunately, the Siri vs S Voice video is not up yet. Ill let you know once its been uploaded.
ZONEofTECH Hi, Ive included the 8th part: Price in the Main episode, so please check that out.
ZONEofTECH Thats only the mic. It doesnt have a secondary microphone for noise cancelation. :(
ZONEofTECH iphone won this round because its have 326 ppi density screen
ZONEofTECH Lol the s3 mini rules see how much more apps it had open also I am using mine now
ZONEofTECH Idk I dint have problems comparing the two cause theyre both different phones. And I own both so nothing to hate really.
ZONEofTECH iOS does have multitask...
ZONEofTECH che paragoni stubbidi che fanno razza di coglioni che siete
ZONEofTECH Iphone 4s has better contrast when taking picture or video than s3 mini
ZONEofTECH iphone seems like its worse with the rolling shutter, also iphone 4s autofocuses, which is all bullshit.
ZONEofTECH Yes, the S3 Mini can play HD movies, but can only record in 720, while the iPhone 4S can record in Full HD, which is 1080p.
ZONEofTECH yup i have.:)) your the best please make a updated viedo :)))))
ZONEofTECH I might get this in my phone store it has the pebble blue color
ZONEofTECH I might try that in another video if Samsung lets me do it :D But I highly doubt it xD
ZONEofTECH Should I buy this phone I m 10 and my hands are sort of small and I think this phone would be good
ZONEofTECH my s3 mini always lag what can i do to fix it
ZONEofTECH i just hate the fact that it doesnt have the led indicator!! urgh apart from that id love to have it for my next phone
ZONEofTECH innovative features that makes samsung unique and more advanced in technology compare to others.. apple is so boring..after using it in just 5 minutes, I feel so bored. still enjoying my s3, but galaxy s4 is the best so far, waiting for note 3 to be my next phone.
ZONEofTECH I love the S4 review I cant wait to own one!!
ZONEofTECH damn thats a really good phone! lol
ZONEofTECH Top video congrats! Am thinking to jump on a Galaxy Xcover 2 )
ZONEofTECH Anyone trading in their iPhone 5 for this?
ZONEofTECH iPhone sucks. It dosent make any sense. Everyone, that know what a real phone is, can see that Samsung Galaxy S4 takes the win, meanwhile Apple is crapping in their pants LONG LIVE TO ANDROID!
ZONEofTECH iPhone sucks. It dosent make any sense. Everyone, that know what a real phone is, can see that Samsung Galaxy S4 takes the win, meanwhile Apple is crapping in their pants LONG LIVE TO ANDROID!
ZONEofTECH i heard it has groilla glass 3 un real
ZONEofTECH This is the best phone in history.
ZONEofTECH Random comment? :D Or is my name Ashley and you are secretly in love with me?
ZONEofTECH No mention of the music device or connectivity to other devices ?
ZONEofTECH Youre a fucking idiot haha
ZONEofTECH You are really really really excited because you found your first pubic hair ?
ZONEofTECH It its true...it will be very owesome!!!!
ZONEofTECH Is it just me, or was this video made in iMovie...jussayin
ZONEofTECH you havent seen nothing yet just wait for the Galaxy note 3. that will blow your away.
ZONEofTECH LoL, yup you knew everything about the S4 LoL, schmuck
ZONEofTECH Too many errors in your info.
ZONEofTECH APPLE SUCKS DICK PLAN AND SIMPLE!!!!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH This game is way better than the Need for Speed: Most Wanted remake, that game is fucking terrible, repetitive and just complete crap, the remake of NFS:MW is a game based on just graphics :
ZONEofTECH I PLAY LOLOLOL SO MANY TIME
ZONEofTECH looks like killzone 3 first off, have you ever played killzone 3? The graphics compared to this far more different, in K3 you can tell they used an paint look, in this its way different, I hope this is actual gameplay and not a false one, cause this looks great
ZONEofTECH I got hardware issues with Civilization 1 on my pentium when i was kid, and i play time to time mario on 8bit Nintendo. What would you like about that if gaming companys would have ended graphics evolution 20 yeas ago. Same is with future generations, they also want fresh graphics with Battlefield 10... So PC still have to lead in future, UHD is coming.
ZONEofTECH its just a demo they are still working on it but true
ZONEofTECH Insane depth of field ... Nothing we havent seen before in other games....
ZONEofTECH Honestly, there isnt a need for retina display. U are not going to watch videos or whatever on it.
ZONEofTECH I think It will have FaceTime, an adjustable wristband and a 4 inch screen display
ZONEofTECH If i get this haha instead of a smartphone in school!
ZONEofTECH Apples going after watch companies now. sue em apple sue them.
ZONEofTECH they will prob make a belt in the future
ZONEofTECH i think that it will be rectangle in shape with various colours and it might have a built in camera
ZONEofTECH I like how he talks in these kinds of videos
ZONEofTECH so you are announcing that Sony announced the announcement for the PS4. Announception. We have to go deeper...
ZONEofTECH For some reason, my voice turned out horrible, not only because I have a cold but maybe the microphone had something to do with it. Dang it...guess Ill have to buy a new mic. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH Hey ZoneofTech there is a untethered jailbreak on ios 6.1.5 P0sixninja
ZONEofTECH this didnt work youre a gay cunt fuck you
ZONEofTECH Thank you soooooo very much, work so weel, like a magic, you just save my day!
ZONEofTECH I have a jailbroken iphone 4s on 5.0.1 factory unlocked... How do i update to 6.1 ?
ZONEofTECH If you were using your Mac mainly for Windows, how big can you make the Windows partition? Can you make it 7080 of the total drive space?
ZONEofTECH Fuck no, because its horrable!
ZONEofTECH Do I have Windows 8? Yes I have Windows 8.1 on my PC  I hate it so much that Im switching to Mac. Do I plan on buying Windows 8? Id never waste my money on such a terrible operating system  even if I had a copy of it, I wouldnt instal it on my Mac.
ZONEofTECH does windows 8 overheat the mac when you run games like windows 7? thats the reason i uninstall windows 7 from my mac
ZONEofTECH I just bought my first MacBook Pro (15 retina). Last apple computer was Performance 6400. Yes, its been awhile. After that experience I went back to PCs and didnt leave until owning every version of iPhone and iPad created. After falling in love with these products I decided to try the MacBook Pro but I dont want to be completely Windows free so Im going to install Windows 8. I was concerned as to the ease of installation but this video has erased that fear. Thank you. I am now a subscribed viewer. :)
ZONEofTECH Where can I buy Windows 8? Its hard to find the full version. E.g. No OEM or SP1 rubbish. I just want a normal version of Windows 8.Thanks ! :)
ZONEofTECH Do I need to buy a copy of windows 8 or can I just borrow a friends? will the reg. key matter?
ZONEofTECH So when I was installing windows 8.1 and went to the Partition screen and had to format the bootcamp partition  I did that and was notified that Windows could not be installed on the partition because it was a GPT type???! What do I do now. This is on a mid 2013 Macbook Air 13. How do I change the partition to a type that Windows can be installed on? Please help me
ZONEofTECH I think this only works with windows 8 if you already had windows 7 first. This did not work for me. Help anyone?
ZONEofTECH For me Windows 8 no need...Thank u... :0
ZONEofTECH also i followed you on Facebook and twitter
ZONEofTECH I want to win because at the moment I have Windows 7. Ive had it for the past 2 years and I want something new :)
ZONEofTECH i would want one because my computer is laggy and slow and old. i want a chance to win something new and a windows 8 product
ZONEofTECH i want to win because it be a good gift for my sis.
ZONEofTECH i really want the windows 8 legally for free because i dont have enough money to buy this...
ZONEofTECH because its more cooler
ZONEofTECH I have a slow Windows computer! I want this please!
ZONEofTECH So are you the spokesman for burn or the creator?? And once ppl download, how can they be sure youre not a hacqer?? ppl just by the disc from apple or whatever OS youre tryin 2 get, better safe than sorry... Never trust a random yu tuber.... aka Blaze
ZONEofTECH How did you get the windows 8 iso????
ZONEofTECH I just bought a windows 8 copy from my local Best buy and I have no ISO file, just a Bootup folder, and a setup.exe please help, I did not just waste 100 dollars, please.
ZONEofTECH were do i get the ISO file...
ZONEofTECH this video was made 2012
ZONEofTECH DELETE THIS VIDEO AND REDO IT AGAIN.
ZONEofTECH yea but apple hasnt even said anything 8
ZONEofTECH Hahaha...when ipad 4 was going to be released videos were showing this model (the first) .....NONE OF THIS MODELS WILL BE IPAD 5 .GET FUCKING RID PF THESE STUPID IDEAS
ZONEofTECH it has already been march? no Ipad 5 so I guess your rumors were wrong.
ZONEofTECH Thats iPad mini you cant trick me!
ZONEofTECH If you have time be sure to check out my channel!
ZONEofTECH haha dude u got a used controller
ZONEofTECH 3g 3g 3gs 3g  scompass see what i did there?
ZONEofTECH Well its been released and confirmed. We have the iPhone 5Same and the iPhone 5Crap. See you have learnt from the past Apple. RIP
ZONEofTECH STFU retard! He makes the best videos on YouTube. Except from the release date everything will most likely turn out to be true! YOU should quit YouTube you 12 year old piece of shit!
ZONEofTECH Its june right now! i dont see any iphones comign up...
ZONEofTECH WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG. Apple has Airdrop, so no NFC. iPhone 5S is coming out in October.
ZONEofTECH This is a lie apple said its coming out fall 2013
ZONEofTECH Stupid video.. I dont know if this guy got to know that iOS 7 beta is released two days back
ZONEofTECH how MP could be that camera ?
ZONEofTECH I DONT LIKE ITUNES 11
ZONEofTECH fuck you appel. you guys fuck up every fucking shit after steve jobs gone!!!!!
ZONEofTECH First comment!!!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH it says syncing but after it finishes it dont appear on the ipod it appears only on the itunes (only in apps)
ZONEofTECH itunes is fucking with everybody becouse they know they can the people who keep changing itunes are idiots
ZONEofTECH I hope that I can upgrade via Lion 10.7.5
ZONEofTECH At first when i buyed my macbook pro I used snow leopard... and one year later I switched from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion.... and it was really cool i will switch this time just for siri because siri is really usefull for me )
ZONEofTECH Hmm..its a damn good configuration. HOWEVER, I suggest buying the 13 inch MBP and upgrading the RAM to 8GB and the HDD to an SSD. Youll pay half the price you paid for the Air. I dont think the thinness is forth paying that price.
ZONEofTECH Will that be upgradable from Lion?
ZONEofTECH siri will probably be an icon in the dock witch will expand like newstand or a folder in ios or launchpad
ZONEofTECH I want to leave comment that will help people okay the newxboxwill probably be available this year why because if you pay attention to release dates of new games coming out this year they mainly focus around novemember its only logic why else? secondly how the world eco is going if shit they wont Release ANYTHING.Come on there only in it to make money not lose it
ZONEofTECH U a bitch u got to much water in your mouth
ZONEofTECH I can here every bit of saliva moving around his mouth every time he says a word.
ZONEofTECH I heard a rumor that the new Xbox will come with as screenpad for your TV or monitor. Basically you can use your hands, like an iPad, to browse the web, download music, movies, and tv shows.
ZONEofTECH Thats pretty much what all consoles are... Man.... consoles blow. Well i guess if you cant afford a computer its better. But you will never achieve the same level of gaming that you can on computer with a console.
ZONEofTECH i just want a controller that fits my hands without me even trying to grasp it.
ZONEofTECH First off, the guy in the video is me. And I have a name, which is Daniel, by the way. Anyway, 8GB really IS insane for a console. Keep in mind that the current Xbox only has 512mb DDR2 ram, while the PS3 has 256mb. The difference between a game X on console and the same game on PC is almost nonexistent. Imagine how good the games will look like with a 2GB GPU, 8GB Ram and Quad Core CPU.
ZONEofTECH That controller will drive me mad lol
ZONEofTECH its ok for peopel they never play starcraft like me to test it :)
ZONEofTECH Awesome :D please SHARE it so more people can find out about it. Also, please SUBSCRIBE to my channel because it helps me more than you think :) Cheers Vlad Ivanov :) (Russian right?)
ZONEofTECH Ok,thx!I apreciate it:)
ZONEofTECH It does work on HoTS. Ok :) The requests for that video have been INSANE :D Tomorrow (4th of July 2013!) The independence day will bring some independence to Heart of the Swarm as well (if you know what I mean)
ZONEofTECH Sadly it doesnt work in sc2 because you cant select what race the computer plays anymore D:
ZONEofTECH Does it work on the new version 2.0.8
ZONEofTECH it worked thx so much first didnt work waited for 6 months then updated when i went back it worked :D
ZONEofTECH Glitch has been found so many times before this upload, where the hell you from??? Here in the US this has been used for while now, no need to show it off like you.
ZONEofTECH it didnt work for Iphone 4s
ZONEofTECH You need to distinguish Google Voice from Google Voice Search. Your video is for GVS, not GV. GV is an alternate phone serviceapp and has nothing to do with this.
ZONEofTECH Guys, please LIKE and SHARE this videos so more people can see it. Thank you :D
ZONEofTECH Is it worth selling my new ipad or ipad 3 to get this??
ZONEofTECH OfficialMrUpdate details...
ZONEofTECH This is still really expensive. Shipping with 128gb SSD with intel core i5. Makes no sense. Apple is just not looking of how bad the economy is.
ZONEofTECH Thank you for the likes :)
ZONEofTECH The iPhone 5 is a bit bigger and faster. Other than that, everything else is the same.
ZONEofTECH Wow rotating vector based maps....pssst android been had that!!!
ZONEofTECH I subscribed to you! Can you subscribe to me?
ZONEofTECH :) I know. Check out my other videos, some of them are actually interesting
ZONEofTECH Haha thx :D I kinda need more subscribers like you. )
ZONEofTECH Pre ordered the 64 gb coming in 2 days!
ZONEofTECH The difference between 8gb and 32gb in cost to apple is nickles and dimes. Apple doesnt price based on cost, they price based on what people will pay. They are pricing it above the iPod 4g because they want to continue selling the 4g at the same price, and they dont want to cannibalize their iPhone sales with a decent iPod touch for 200 dollars.
ZONEofTECH what.......the gay bar?
ZONEofTECH Black is best for ipod touch 5g and whitesilver for iphone
ZONEofTECH Most likely getting it Wednesday :)
ZONEofTECH can we use navigation on this one?
ZONEofTECH HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHHHAAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!! when i hear your voice i picture a fat dude with no hair and big glasses with a huge red tie and suspenders :3
ZONEofTECH How much will it cost? Please reply
ZONEofTECH its a shame i dont have it yet... im keeping it foreverr
ZONEofTECH P.S the first Samsung phones may be horrible but the Samsung galaxy s4 has absolutely nothing related to apples iphones.
ZONEofTECH Apple didnt invent everything, some of their stuff is from ideas they got from other products. The thing about apple is that they dont make crap products. They see touch screen phones, and slim computers, and think, hmm thats a good idea, they would have made more money on that idea if the product werent total crap. so then apple decides that the world would be better off if they used their expertise to make a decent product.
ZONEofTECH I do not get any money for my videos. At least not yet.
ZONEofTECH Is samsung is better than apple why did they have to copy and steal all of apples designs, ideas, and innovations? Obviously apple is superior, or else everyone wouldnt be coming out with their own versions of apples products.
ZONEofTECH this phone can smmell my butt, do u know y
ZONEofTECH Because Im going to be staring at wondering about the pixels all day!
ZONEofTECH For fuck sake just get on with it
ZONEofTECH iphone 4 put it on sale
ZONEofTECH I got mine for Christmas and I love it so much TeamIphone
ZONEofTECH Is it even worth it for a first phone its like 100150
ZONEofTECH Even greener than before? Wait... Really?? I didnt know those factories in China thought, Green! I dont think the little kids that built it really care...
ZONEofTECH Fuck it I will buy 3gs
ZONEofTECH the iphone 4s looks way better then the stupid 3gs
ZONEofTECH Youve got cute little fingers
ZONEofTECH lame we want some exitement
ZONEofTECH Say iPhone 5 5 times then post this on two other viedos
ZONEofTECH Thanks for the video. Liked the video already :D. This was really helpful! You should do another video on what TRIM is...Upon looking at the wikipedia page, I dont think I get how it works still.
ZONEofTECH great, simple, helpful video. Thanks!
ZONEofTECH Tnx for the vid...but it didnt work for me...still after a couple reboots it says that the patch is active but trim wont work...im on osx 10.8.3 with Apple SSD SM128
ZONEofTECH The trimmer app? Which one? the one from iMovie?
ZONEofTECH Thx Lisa! I will make a top 10 epic songs video in the near future so stay tune for that. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH i have one of those,he said you cant take videos on them....WRONG!!
ZONEofTECH Galaxy S4 is the best
ZONEofTECH Thats my first iPhone! memories 3333
ZONEofTECH moshimonsterslover10 your 11 and your getting an iPhone? Ok um 44S is good unless you want the bigger screen then get 5
ZONEofTECH Dude wtf are you trying to do put off people wow iPhone 3GS might be faster big deal I have a 3G and its fine for me
ZONEofTECH I have had portable Apple products for like 6 years, and when you said Get it? FINGER TIPS That was the very first time that I ever got it. Thank you sooo much.
ZONEofTECH Excellent video. I have a 5400 in my Alienware right now and am sure it is bottlenecking my machine. This video has convinced me to just order a Samsung 840 EVO 250GB. Cant wait to see the performance results. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH and the shut down time is only handy when your girlfriend walks in when you where watching porn if she minds)
ZONEofTECH yeah nice comparing ssd with a 5400 rpm hdd thats not even fair for hdd
ZONEofTECH Mother fuck samsung ssds because their so slow I bought one for 350 and it was so slow the hdd is faster than the ssd in a 1000000764589643221578900086421135789087532211278 times slower. I HATE SAMSUNG the apple ssd is faster than the samsung one in 157863323789009753224567532116789963214579952224567742211345780086321456974325688942135890754212357795436909542. TIMES
ZONEofTECH What if I want my OS (mountain lion) to be on the SSD?? BTW I have the same SSD
ZONEofTECH The links are now active. I was asleep so thats why I didnt put them up. The SSD vs HDD link doesnt exist since the video is not up yet.
ZONEofTECH Thx :D Im really glad I was able to help you. Please SUBSCRIBE to my channel if you havent already done so. By doing this you motivate and support me. Thx alot redd3 :)
ZONEofTECH I love the Darth Vader breathing at the end.
ZONEofTECH walmart if there in stock
ZONEofTECH hahaha i have the same ipod nano and it too was my first venture into buying an apple product, it was the first ipod that i actually liked and still like to this day, i just went to game stop and bought a used but well taken care of black 8 gig ipod nano 3rd gen and i plan to keep using then till they stop working.
ZONEofTECH Nah, I usually talk like that when presenting the product. Its quite difficult for me to make these videos in English, since its not my first language. Anyway, thx you again for watching and also for subbing :) Oh, and thx for the extra views, its really appreciated.
ZONEofTECH I own this ..Its weak. dont buy
ZONEofTECH Mo money  No problems

retrogametech Play MYST now! And Riven after! It was an innovative Adventure and still a nice one today. You really have first no clue, what to do and have to figure it out by yourself. Like beeing stranded after a friggin InterdimensionalTime Travel  Fail. I started with Riven by the way, never thought i had to learn a written language that exist in a game, but it was really interessting.
retrogametech Wow you never heard of myst,I spent a good couple of months of my childhood life trying to solve its puzzles, it wasis probably the best puzzle point and click adventure of all time, well worth a play :) PS Also bought the boo after seeing it on another youtubers video , but here it cost R380 or 33 British pounds
retrogametech I have this book.I got it for 10.00  with a different cover.

screenjunkies kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies Vince Vaughn is a FUCKING WEIRDO!!!
screenjunkies I thought every one hated The Last Airbender?
screenjunkies thats the worst Screen Junkies episode!!!!!!! but still made me smile.
screenjunkies he seems like he has something to hide i think he has a porno out
screenjunkies Vince Vaughn sucks!!!
screenjunkies Throughout this video there is a Pee Wee Herman doll behind you and that got me thinking  are you related?
screenjunkies This is so awkward its hilarious
screenjunkies when you asked why he left that girl
screenjunkies the most efficient way to make that thing fast is to remove ALL of its parts and replace them with all parts of an already fast car.
screenjunkies I love screen junkies, but dude. This shit sucks.( in my movie trailer voice)
screenjunkies Drop it out of a plane! LOL!
screenjunkies If I wanted to street race this scion, what should I do ....buy a faster car
screenjunkies You can rotate the cabin 180 degrees making it a RWD car
screenjunkies The Rock did Doom  Vin Diesel never did anything that bad.
screenjunkies I think The Rocks ego problem is what sets them apart. Unless hes learned some humility over the years.
screenjunkies I kinda want to punch Mark in the face...
screenjunkies and you forgot Q or would you have the original
screenjunkies if this movie was made with the choices you made  i would consider seeing it.... on dvd!
screenjunkies Id reboot Breaking Bad and heres my dream castHugh Jackman as Walter WhiteJake Lloyd as Jesse PinkmanChristopher Reeve as Hank SchraderRussell Crowe as Saul GoodmanIdris Elba as Gus FringGwneth Paltrow as Skyler WhiteAnd I would have The Coen Brothers as director
screenjunkies Holy crisp on a Turkey... I didnt think that much of the choices individually, but in that final pic with them all together I would watch the sht out of that show!
screenjunkies XD keep it whoopy made my night
screenjunkies JJ Abrams should reboot: Gremlins, but make it in space
screenjunkies this is just sad i hope that patrick stewart is long dead before picard is recasted in his place and focus on the current startrek cast. the first star trek had i think five movies and years before tng was broadcasted and if the show is reboot im sure the fans will be pleased to see star trek still active but im writing a fanfiction apart from any current star trek time line with naomi wieldman is an aging admiral in star fleet becuase rather then recasting an old franchise i think we should move on and boldly go where no man has gone before.
screenjunkies I think he should reboot Firefly
screenjunkies I hate the way they only want Cranston to play the same character he does in Breaking Bad, I am sure he good enough an actor to be just as dignified and diplomatic in his own way, perhaps with a fake French accent, and not have to play the same character as in Breaking Bad. The shows over! And I am sad to say that Next Generation is over too, its been a couple decades now, but most of the cast is still alive, and reboots are an extreme artistic cop out anyway, its almost as if scifi has officially declared itself dead by reducing itself to dystopias, reboots, and superhero movie after superhero movie, and with so many chubby males 3060 losing their shit over something that is like 88 CG, like video games they are too lazy to play. Its like peoples imaginations are so destroyed they rely on others like it was a drug.
screenjunkies Michael looks like Christopher Walkens fat nephew.
screenjunkies Hooch is going to find this guy and mow him down. Heavy on the bass.
screenjunkies No, Donald faison ftw! I love zack Braff, no one has to donate, its voluntary
screenjunkies Kickstarter seems real simple. Dont think a project deserves your donation, dont give them money. I really dont understand the fuss.
screenjunkies Is this supposed to be satirical?
screenjunkies This seems very petty
screenjunkies did he pay you money to say that...because you know, hes fucking rich.
screenjunkies And just who the hell is this guy to think that he gets to decide who or what kickstarter is for? Love the channel, kinda hating this douchebag.
screenjunkies People wanted to see Veronica Mars, so they backed. Melissa Joan Hart just wanted to get money for a movie so she could get back to being a major celeb. Nothing there was appealing to enough people so she was not funded. Zach has been open about his desires for this film, where the money would come from, and why he is using Kickstarter. Do I know Zach? No. Do I believe that he is sincere? Yes. Good enough for me and I get to have a private online screening of the film and hell answer questions!
screenjunkies I watched Don Jon with my mom. That was really awkward
screenjunkies What the hell was that? Ill NEVER see your shit again! I just wanted to see ONE of your videos, and THIS?! Fuck you!
screenjunkies ive never seen this movie and it looks fucking disturbing xP
screenjunkies go and watch a serbian film human centipede is a childs movie compared to a serbian film and if that wasnt sick enough for you watch the vomit gore triology have fun
screenjunkies This movie is fucked up
screenjunkies Tom Six  Tom Sick lol
screenjunkies Yea uhm i had to watch emmerdale...
screenjunkies Iron Man 3 is great?! What Marvel fans wanted?! Fans wanted them to wipe their asses with the comics by turning The Mandarin (Iron Mans archnemesis) into a pathetic, washedup actor?!
screenjunkies Amy Nickolson won! Her top 5 were all in the top 5, and although the order was slightly different, she was the only one to do this. She also was the closest to despicable mes outcome, and she was the only one who was right about The Great Gatsby making the top 10. She also was one of two who was right about The Heat making the top 10. Pretty impressive!
screenjunkies Wolverine is the best movie of the Summer... No question
screenjunkies its what marvel fans want from a marvel movie HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHABULLSHIT!!!!!
screenjunkies stop saying Pacific Rim is an original frenchise, cause it is not! Watch some Evangelion anime, thats where PR got all the ideas!
screenjunkies Green lantern You are good to go
screenjunkies 2013 summer had so much movies I LOVED IT!
screenjunkies Apparently most people would rather pay to watch a sequelrebootcomic book adaptation than something new and original. Go figure.
screenjunkies Pacific Rim was the most awesome movie!
screenjunkies I saw Tailor Lautner did comedy this year. It was like death. Hilarious.
screenjunkies Mike Tyson, i would just cry and try kissing his feet. Maybe i would be so exited that i would puke or something :D
screenjunkies How are you a fan of the rock and be fat as fuck, wait, fat as shit?
screenjunkies Keanu Reeves. Id feign a handshake, go for the fist bump and then force a hug. The hug would be several seconds longer than it should be with one hand a bit too low. Our faces would inadvertently touch. Lastly, as he walked away, Id call to him, expectantly.
screenjunkies Jim Carrey, Robert Downey Jr, Slash, Johnny Depp or Eminem :) Also Freddie Mercury and Michael Jackson, but its impossible to meet them because of a very obvious reason :D
screenjunkies arnold schwarzenegger and chuck norris, hope i wrote arnolds last name correct.. i would absolutely pee myself.
screenjunkies Thats how I would be if I met eminem
screenjunkies Jason Statham or Arnold Schwarzenegger. Id lose my shit to meet these guys. Id ask The Stath how many ways he could kill me with the 10 items closest to him. Shit, itd be awesome to meet you guys. You produce some funny ass shit. Im shitting a galaxy of atoms in my pants from laughter 85 of the time. (The other 15 is reserved for sleeping and masturbating.)
screenjunkies You guys are great! keep it up.They are just people
screenjunkies I would love to meet Nick Mundy cow cool!
screenjunkies deu vontade de assistir de novo kkk at hoje no sei pq aquele trex salvou o povo das gemeas olsen
screenjunkies O dinossauro falando Allan no 3 filme realmente estraga tudo xD
screenjunkies Muito bom, mas faz dos outros como Les Miserables e Sky Fall.
screenjunkies Nick Fury de dois olhos! ehehueuheauh
screenjunkies Game of thrones sucks ass. Its stupid, boring and way to much nudity witch I usually dont mind but here its like they put a naked chick in at every chance they get, its degrading. The plots are to confusing, there is barely any action. I dont know why people like this show . I want to know why.
screenjunkies Where Are My Dragons!!
screenjunkies Favorite: Jon Snow         Dislike: Theon
screenjunkies Favourite: Tyrion Lannister, Arya Stark, Khaleese (I forgot her full name)Annoying: JoffreyHated: Joffrey, Cercei
screenjunkies Where Are My Dragons!!
screenjunkies Forgot oneSamwell Tarleyspecial kind of courage. Courage that comes from desperation. Probably the only true courage anyway.
screenjunkies Jaqen Hghar the best.end.
screenjunkies lame copy of honest trailer
screenjunkies I dont need to get caught up, but I like watching these anyways. :)
screenjunkies Take a look at this video on YouTube:
screenjunkies Dude...... Hal is fucking drunk hahaha still pro though.
screenjunkies it was actually pretty cool when u drank the blood
screenjunkies Hahaha this had me laughing so much.
screenjunkies The beggining was all racist
screenjunkies Most Epic TV Drinking Games! (Breaking Bad, Homeland, Game of Thrones, Girls, Etc.)
screenjunkies Its strange they didnt show the Top Gun drinking game, you can even barely pass through the first scenes
screenjunkies that wasnt disgusing at all...
screenjunkies Sooooooooooo...... Beer?
screenjunkies We actually make custom cocktails and drinking games for films all the time  weve got them all over at Alcohollywood (dot com)! Example: The Mutt Williams (for Crystal Skull): 2 parts Crystal Head Vodka (can substitute with any comparable vodka) 2 parts Kahlua 2 parts Baileys Irish Cream 1 part banana liqueur
screenjunkies I got a better one, drink every time they drop their weapon in a fight, and also any time Sam or Dean take a drink in the later seasons.
screenjunkies every time walter scolds jessie for screwing up
screenjunkies any one else notice the striking resemblance to the pee wee herman doll on the bookshelf to the right...
screenjunkies Give Obama a break Star Trek likely wasnt popular in Kenya when he was born. LolSiFi holiday how about July 8th Roswell crash day
screenjunkies This guy sounds like that Sicilian villain from The Princess Bride
screenjunkies Anyone beside me know that there going to fuck everyone over with Sopa 2014 again
screenjunkies Obama did try which is cool but he failed quite badly. If hes going to venture into using science fiction he should make sure he knows his stuff. He would actually be a lot cooler if he actually watched Star Trek and Star Wars. After his presidency that is. Im sure he has no time to do that as president and spend time with his family. Unless his familys watching that kind of Sci Fi.
screenjunkies a jedi mind meld actually does exist from the star wars expanded universe.
screenjunkies what, that he has the original DVD release box set that i also have but is now useless cause i obviously got the blueray set? i mean come on it, LotR, gotta have that shit in blueray.. but ya, is that all yer referencing? i dont get why this is a top comment, lol..
screenjunkies Well, we already have a blow sh!t up day (74). So... maybe we should have Picard Day and celebrate by giving all the little kids lasers and cell phones.
screenjunkies I was the only girl in my whole middle school to despise this when it first came out
screenjunkies PLS PLS PLS Say: Bewbs...Bewbs...Bewbs. Oh yeah thats the one!
screenjunkies Go home, stares... Youre drunk.
screenjunkies He was also pretty good in Water For Elephants.
screenjunkies only epic thing about these movies is at 2:29 where bellas daugther is sitting on jacob werewolf form
screenjunkies Say I have the one Dyldo to rule them all.
screenjunkies i rather have my head rip off   gold
screenjunkies There is only 1 big problem of the Twilight saga finishing... we wont get any more of these honest trailers
screenjunkies With all this staring Im surprised no one caught on fire.
screenjunkies I never actually noticed how much they all stare at each other until now
screenjunkies Could someone just tell me the name of stares song ?
screenjunkies 0:13 onwards what music is that?
screenjunkies We cant think of anything for this scene, just stare for five minutes
screenjunkies Omg you guys actually suffered through all these movies to make this vid! Thats what i call a sacrifice for the audience!
screenjunkies I cant believe I made it through the whole 26 minutes  there is must be something wrong with me haha :P
screenjunkies I just think its funny that Bellas grampa is Miles Matheson (Revolution) with a mustachio..
screenjunkies Did you know that for three hours, Kristen Stewart kept her mouth open during the entire series?
screenjunkies the thing w adele was a little too mean
screenjunkies Hal Rudnick should host the Oscars
screenjunkies Hal would be great. I watch the Oscars anyway but it would be very entertaining if he hosted.
screenjunkies 3:08How dare you sir. NO!!!... No... :P
screenjunkies Non, il na pas mon ami. :P
screenjunkies Oh fuck man, that antiSemitic Ted joke was hilarious. :p Also, what do you mean awkward pronunciation of Les Miserables? Thats how you pronounce it. Awkward for Americans maybe.
screenjunkies The best person to host the Oscars is ups Russia
screenjunkies A mix between Hitler and the gay villain from skyfall
screenjunkies Were ANY of the XMens good???
screenjunkies Come on! I like the XMen Origins Wolverine
screenjunkies NO, it will not suck! This is too good a cast and director to suck. it WILL redeem the last couple crappers. (X3 and Origins). Little known fact here  First Class started as Xmen Origins: Magneto, however after several drafts it turned into First Class. But it never lost the focus on Magneto, he was the main character throughout the entire film. I believe this is why it was so successful. People LOVE Magneto and to see him in his prime like a lot of the cartoons and comics do, it just hit all the right spots.
screenjunkies they ruined dead pool i hope if they put dead pool in the movie it wont be that mouth less abomination they took away his mouth his nick name is the merc with a mouth
screenjunkies The Marvel street level heroes. Spidey, Daredevil, Iron Fist, Luke Cage, Moon Knight?Black Cat?
screenjunkies Star Wars and Star Trek meet that would blow my mind
screenjunkies The Host for this vid is Sucks...
screenjunkies I agree, i was very upset with the misconduct of Dark Phoenix as just Code Name or alter ego than the Cosmic Force it is.
screenjunkies Hollywood knows it has to make superheroes movies good then how do you explain the clusterfuck last part of The Wolverine. Started great, middle is OK. Then boom everything went to crap.
screenjunkies I hate romantic movies and so do all other men thats why guys will try to fell up their dates while their watching a romantic movie You first think why dont they just screw already ... wait a minute thats why I agreed to come here! arm over the shoulder and on to the tit or other sexy parts of the body really anything you can touch without getting thrown out of the movie theater
screenjunkies Sterling archer and leela from futurama it would be so funny cuz archer would just like be nonstop making fun of her eye and then theyd start fighting and then knowing archer have sex
screenjunkies Needless to say, none of these women are keepers. These arent even obscure references or anything.
screenjunkies 1.Dirty Dancing2.Sixteen Candles3.Twilight4.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind(I think?)5.The terminator6.Star wars7.Back to the future
screenjunkies Hum.. Ok, but first, lets clarify things.. Does porn count as movies and does one right hand count as getting laid?
screenjunkies dont forget star wars a new hope for the blowing up the death star reference
screenjunkies Edward Cullen and Katniss Everdeen. They both love trees.
screenjunkies Alexander Delarge and Stephen Kings Carrie
screenjunkies Best halftime show would be directed by JJ Abrams  who cares who is performing....he would reboot it!
screenjunkies Hulk Hogan riding on a motorcycle over a pool of sharks, doing a backflip, while hes on fire and landing to perform a heaavy metal version of the National Anthem.
screenjunkies Agree! Also Micheal Jackson and Prince put on awesome Halftime shows!
screenjunkies Tu pac hologram halftime show
screenjunkies Its a bowl with super powers like superman.
screenjunkies Most epic halftime show Benedict Cumberbatch summing up random people in the audience like in Sherlock.
screenjunkies They should be in it too.
screenjunkies Forget Harriet Tubman, Im offended that she does not know who Buffy is.
screenjunkies I just hated the fact that Hansel had sugar sickness. You can get diabetes in TWO ways.Get fat or it just happens. My little brothers got diabetes and hes the skinniest boy Ive ever seen. The type that makes you take blood test every hour...
screenjunkies Clearly there is only one conclusion, this video isnt funny.
screenjunkies chipotle is awesome!!!!
screenjunkies Jesus is not a fairytale, and thats really offensive.
screenjunkies Ive never laughed so hard at a youtube video in my life.
screenjunkies Xman made me realize that Im just a bit too subtle.
screenjunkies How can you not know who Harriet Tubman is?!
screenjunkies What. Is. Wrong. With. These. Idiots.How does that even portray modern day witches poorly when its a fictional movie based on a fairy tale? If it was set in 2014, then id get it, a little.
screenjunkies sonic screwdriver them in the face
screenjunkies i really laughed at this !!!!
screenjunkies Best way to kill a zombie is to push my ex wife to the ground and crush it by running the zombie over with her enormously overweight body! Nothing can survive that!.......... Splat! Zombie kill of the month!
screenjunkies Haley Boaz so many things wrong with your statement first of all a silencer and suppressor are the same thing. Second if you were in a helicopter dont you think that the zombies would be attracted to that? So why even bother with a suppressor when you are in a helicopter?

screenjunkies The best way to kill a zombie is to get its attention so its limping towards you, run up duck down cut the legs off so its crawling around... And then make it come towards you again and stab its head.... Unless its R... :)
screenjunkies crossbow bolt in the the brain daryl Dixon style
screenjunkies kill the zombie with Rob Corddry.
screenjunkies And you do have an amazing voice :O
screenjunkies Breaking Bad chemistry set.
screenjunkies Blazing Saddles ... I mean if were going to go for offensive.
screenjunkies Does anyone see that he looks like that puppet behind him the one in the suit
screenjunkies SAW traps for your barbie dolls,book on how to talk to teen by Cersie Lannister and cook book by Hannibal Lecter :D
screenjunkies probably Birth of a nation
screenjunkies Pulp fiction overdose kit
screenjunkies American Pie action figures, anyone?? D
screenjunkies Legenda Batman DKR please!
screenjunkies Hey, the Amazing SpiderMan was great! Better than the original!
screenjunkies FAT MAN LIKES TO SHOUT!!! FATMAN SAY LOUD WORDS... if there were razzies for worst panel member then FAT MAN WHO SHOUTS would definitely get it..
screenjunkies I thought Battleship was pretty good
screenjunkies Look at all these white guys hating on madea..
screenjunkies Amazing SpiderMan was dope
screenjunkies Well, at least Hal was kind enough to accept the award they deserve. Screen Junkies should quit making this stupid show, that doesnt discuss anything in detail, and is playing just long enough to piss you off. Stick to what youre good at, Honest Trailers. Its the only reason people subscribe anyway.
screenjunkies dude who can trash talk cloud atlas? Who are you lol. What was the last movie you saw that was so different? Trash talk battleship all you want, but your not watching the same movie if you didnt like it
screenjunkies You know, Battleship was really stupid, but atleast it was entertaining.
screenjunkies Die Hard 6 Im getting too old for this shit!
screenjunkies I dont get why Hal has a fake hand : Oh and JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE HARD :)
screenjunkies WTF is wit dat hand X::: D it looks like a hollowcast P (sorry for not being sorry i just made a holocaust joke, its on my bucket list, wish me death if you see fit to lol)
screenjunkies Say: Yippie Kay Yay!, Motherf!
screenjunkies I we please get nick his own show
screenjunkies If they decide to make more Die Hard movies they should stick to basics as fatty boy here said, and quit putting John McClane in ridiculous situations. They should follow Die Hard ones storyline where at first McClane wasnt a happy triger, and they could start by following his carrer from patrolman to detective and romancing Holly Gennaro. Die Hard must not be turned into a crappy summer blockbuster attempt, holding a good plot will have us series fans happy and paying for movie tickets.
screenjunkies More Nick Munday, hes awesome.
screenjunkies 4:32  Fake arm?? Funny, cuz if you go to google and search hal rudnick fake arm video this one pops up... at least for me
screenjunkies There will be no Die Hard 6, the last film destroyed the franchise.
screenjunkies The Christopher Nolan award should go to World War Z, for the most obligatory use of that sound
screenjunkies AHAHAHA!!! the Chris Nolan Award...
screenjunkies Battleship was One of the shittiest Movies ive ever seen. I reckon world war z is gonna be Even worse i hie.
screenjunkies in memoriam  best part
screenjunkies Nope. I just watched the movie
screenjunkies oh cmon, prometheus wasnt THAT bad.....
screenjunkies It is possible to buy or download the song in the part in memorium Its funny
screenjunkies I love the way Hal says screenies
screenjunkies On its own its a halfdecent popcorn movie, but as a supposed Alien prequel, its horse dung.
screenjunkies Eu ri..... ri .... e ri ....
screenjunkies praticamente o Duke Nukem narrando, kkk
screenjunkies LINDSAY LOHAN KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK

screenjunkies Frodo e o protagonista mas blz ...
screenjunkies sou super f de LOTR e ADOREI AHDUHSDOAUIHSDAUIOHSDUAIHSDUAIOHUIHDASUHSAD
screenjunkies intao se for pra procurar defeitos, vamos procurar os defeitos de alguns dos melhores filmes da historia, como Titanic e The Godfather...voce vai achar erros MUITO mais grotescos que esses ai do Batman, e mesmo assim esses filmes nao deixam de ser alguns dos melhores de todos os tempos...
screenjunkies rapaz, mais se voce for procurar, esses furos sempre existiram, afinal  dificil manter a linearidade num personagem que ja foi retratado em em dezenas de versoes diferentes, cada versao com suas caracteristicas e seu enredo...afinal, se voce for ler os quadrinhos, vai encontrar varios furos...intao eu axo q nesse caso, deixar errado,  fazer o certo...e o q prova minha teoria,  q com vc disse, Nolan dirigiu Memento, um dos meus filmes favoritos, ele nao cometeria esses furos sem perceber
screenjunkies Leslie Manns such a trooper.
screenjunkies 0:25 I cant tell which one is the real Pee Wee Herman
screenjunkies James woods picard Forest whitakerlaforge Kevin bacondata Djimon Hounsouworf Jeff Bridgesriker Drew BarrymoreBeverly Kyle GallnerWesley
screenjunkies Those three are the best.
screenjunkies I left a comment. Now do I get a shirt?
screenjunkies Paul needs to up his waxing skillz, he waxed the wrong way!
screenjunkies Merry christmas :) Loreen 3
screenjunkies Ive got over 55,000 pieces. SHUT THE FUCK UP. Hahahahaha
screenjunkies This is my 3rd time watching this  I just noticed the toy in your pocket. Hahaha
screenjunkies This came out the same day as Sandy Hook. Rest in Peace Sandy Hook kids. (Please, Hal, read this for those kids)
screenjunkies That supermans wish for flight reminded me of a joke about a guy taking women out in the middle of the water and depp cant play van damn in bloodsport...dont ask...
screenjunkies Johnny Depp could NOT play Luke Skywalker... unless he used his whiny voice from his early days on 21 Jumpstreet. Then Id just rather see him play Princess Leah.
screenjunkies What would Superman having phone sex sound like? I laughed for five minutes
screenjunkies What would Superman having phone sex sound like? I laughed for five minutes
screenjunkies Superman was a sexless boyscout that didnt exist, this guy gets women throwing themselves at him over just a costume. Do I sense some jellies?
screenjunkies Or a decent actor, for that matter.
screenjunkies ya know superman is Jewish (or was) idk why they made him talk to a priest when he was originally Jewish
screenjunkies I lost myself at  Its a wonderful Circumcision . xD
screenjunkies Funny, and its not stereotyping if he is jewish.
screenjunkies I think he got arrested for comming out without his pants
screenjunkies not even jewish and i found this like... insulting...
screenjunkies He obviously got arrested for vandalism after the bullets they shot at him destroyed a wall
screenjunkies Somehow I think youll keep responding. As a Hasbarat its your job! Shit I wish my job was so amusing. Orangeman? Youve got me all wrong. I identify with White people before we were ever corrupted by that alien religion from the Middle East called Christianity. You are using the Algiz rune. To say youre a Catholic is laughable. You freaks are all mixedup. Keep trying to blend in though as it is quite funny.
screenjunkies And the Schindlers list joke, so dark but hilarious.
screenjunkies ROSTO IDIOTA?ATUAO COMPLETAMENTE SEM EMOO???????????? no acredito q eu li isso, a jenn foi perfeita
screenjunkies Hilrio. S no concordei com o fato de acharem que a Jen no passou emoo como Katniss. Mas, opinio  opinio. Curti!
screenjunkies this has gotta be the nerdiest wtf moment on youtube ive seen. stormtroopers only miss if your leia, luke, or han (or a jedi with a lightsabe preprequels)
screenjunkies Fantasy Fantasy Football. Looks like fun. I think the Power Play rule makes this.
screenjunkies I was expecting football but then you play something which definitely isnt football. Football is a sport where feet actually touch the ball, hence the name.
screenjunkies Was Mario Andre from Blacknerdcomedy?
screenjunkies That Ed cosplayer was so spoton!
screenjunkies Someone needs to form a league for this.
screenjunkies BABBA BOOEY! This was hilarious! SDCC 13 event? Lets do this!
screenjunkies This should be a real sport
screenjunkies I like the screen junkies show more than honest trailers
screenjunkies He handled it well, so unlike youtube, great attitude man.
screenjunkies Hal seems like such a nice guy. Id feel bad if I left an angry comment. Its the Internet and I would feel bad. Thats how much I like you Hal. You greedy Jewish bastard with odd charisma that slowly grows on you like mold or some type of fungal infection.
screenjunkies Those jokes are not funny Anne Frankly, theyre a little insensitive.
screenjunkies Well, I for one think people should stop acknowledging negative comments altogether, let alone making videos dedicated to them in exchange of some quick cash, because that only makes it worse.
screenjunkies I actually think hes quite funny, and it takes time to take honest trailers. At the least think of him as a filler. (But I still think these videos are good :D )
screenjunkies Great way to turn negative comments into a fun vid. I like this guy
screenjunkies Thats funny, youre a funny guy...you know...the way you tell the story...what?
screenjunkies Those girls looked like they were going to die when he said that Robert Patterson (is that how you spell it?) was there.
screenjunkies I would have wet myself laughing if at the end he told them they were fake tickets
screenjunkies Disliked for happy ending.
screenjunkies i was reeeeeaaallly hoping that no one would get to gothe tears would have been able to sustain 300 generations of saltwater fish,and dear GOD would it have been satsifying
screenjunkies These girls need to realize that twilight is about a pedophiliac , unhealthy and abusive relationship
screenjunkies oh my god I did 58 seconds
screenjunkies The Part Where They said hes so hot just made me gag, and when the 11 year old said that twilight was her favorite movie hands down, just killed me!!! That movie is so stupid! Sorry fans!
screenjunkies my dad actually read twilight
screenjunkies That moment of relief on the other two dads faces when they find out they werent going...LOL
screenjunkies What kind of audition is this? lmao
screenjunkies Snow White and Mickey. Still a better love story than Twilight.
screenjunkies Check out Snow White attempting to wear the Slave Leia outfit the Disney Star Wars Auditions.disneystarwars
screenjunkies sebastian as palpatine. FUCK YES
screenjunkies MICKY: And I slaughtered them like animals! God, I died laughing.
screenjunkies I will hate the Shitty CGI than the Prequel
screenjunkies can you guy make the extended version with the snow white part ?
screenjunkies Im actually glad theyve taken over the franchise. They usually do well with the companies they buy, like they did with Pixar. At any rate, they cant screw it up any more than Lucas has.
screenjunkies The only good film to come out of disney is pirates of the carribian.
screenjunkies Ryanrightnow , highfive
screenjunkies How is that funny? Thats just being pests and, well, total assholes. Lame.
screenjunkies idiots. not funny. just nerds annoying people, they seem autistic.
screenjunkies why are there so many douchebags??? Does being a douchebag prove your manliness or something or what?
screenjunkies Pranks are supposed to be funny not piss everybody off... douchbags, lame.
screenjunkies That shirtless guy with the guitar is hot xD
screenjunkies I hated Kevin on SourceFed and I hated this video. It was absolutely stupid.
screenjunkies Im surprised they didnt get shot XD
screenjunkies Its ironic that this youtube video was relatively a waste of time
screenjunkies AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Raz Al Gul XDDDDDDD Fuck you Hal!!! You make me laugh all the video XDDDDDDDDDD
screenjunkies What the fuck was with the Michael Jackson
screenjunkies Can you please do the Dark Knight Rises. I can imagine how hilarious it will be already.
screenjunkies can u do the amazing spiderman
screenjunkies no dark spirits like hitler? all people are a mix of good and evil... what a stupid thing to say
screenjunkies Ras Al Ghul... Bane.. Batman.. LOLOLOLOLOL
screenjunkies This guy is trying too hard to be funny. Stick to Honest Trailers.
screenjunkies those honey boo boo people are exactly how europeans think all american look like )
screenjunkies Aww thats cute..... They think theyre people.
screenjunkies Oh god no, oh god noooo, no no , no god please no, no no nooooooo!!!!!!
screenjunkies dont forget the tellitubbies and my little ponies friendship is magic
screenjunkies honey boo boo is a fucking shame to usa
screenjunkies Have not seen a Walken movie? I know you guys are fat... But surely that fat does not block your eyes
screenjunkies IT BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
screenjunkies Not really. Id say the scum of the earth is maybe the guy who kept those woman prisoner in his basement for 10 years? These people are harmless. They take care of their family and if TLC wants to give them a few bucks to be on tv why the hell not?
screenjunkies Came here for Christopher Walken reading.Left because of Hal Rudnik. And fucking Sketty.
screenjunkies I LOVE SEVEN PSYCHPATHS Congrats on coming up with the odd idea of having Christopher, Colin, and Sam read Honey Boo Boo..how cool and weird.
screenjunkies Makes up for the show being such an atrocity...I still refuse to watch it.
screenjunkies Wait, did the Rapture happen and I missed it?Too early for the Mayan Apocalypse right?I honestly am starting to rethink the wisdom of this living during the end of days. This vid was pretty terrifying.But you have to admit, Walken nailed it.
screenjunkies Ill take that partial comment and never fear, some Americans still have some sense haha.
screenjunkies When he is eating the sketti it looks like hes going to cry. Also I love their faces when he says Honey boo boo
screenjunkies Unsuscribe because of sketti.
screenjunkies and the oscar goes to super vagina heuheuheu
screenjunkies BENJAMIM BUTTTON ANSDAIHEASLJKDAS DALC SLCMALS
screenjunkies Eles foram procurar um prequel e s acharam um albino careca!
screenjunkies kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk and super vagina
screenjunkies ai to passando mal xD
screenjunkies HELLO JOVEM NERD KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
screenjunkies Bane Gay  KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
screenjunkies na boa, avenger foi um lixo de filme
screenjunkies Cara voc pode ir legendando todos os trailers do Honest Trailers que vai ficar muito bom , as legendas ficaram legais , bom video !
screenjunkies Eles se comunicam por uma especie de bio chip que fica implantado na orelha, mostrou no marvel agents of shield no episodio 3 ou 4 parece, eles colocam o dedo na orelha para ativar a transmisso.
screenjunkies haaaahahaha... verdade! como eles se comunicam? chip implantado nos cabeo? rsrs
screenjunkies J imaginaram como seria o trailler de Os Vingadores, se ele fosse honesto com a gente?
screenjunkies 2:30 you can see the martial arts teacher wondering to himself Is this really worth all the money hes paying me?
screenjunkies is there an honest trailer for Taken?
screenjunkies This is crazy funny too. These guys are geniuses.
screenjunkies You can save all those jews Thank you by the way LMAO
screenjunkies Hal would be taken, but he would annoy his captors so much theyd try to ditch him. :D
screenjunkies saddam Hussein ? 3:33 ?
screenjunkies Officer Berk is a actor
screenjunkies Richard Steinbicker found this bit of goldness... what if looper was a disney movie from the nineties? coolness
screenjunkies Hes basically guy who looks too old for his age, so its kind of typecast, hes perfect for the role :D
screenjunkies yeah, that was the point of the video. they took clips of Bruce Willis from The Kid and clips of Joseph GordonLevitt from Angels in the Outfield to make a Disney version of Looper
screenjunkies does everyone seriously think this is a real trailer? stupid people
screenjunkies Great Scot we have to send Bruce Willis of now today to himself in the past!
screenjunkies oh i thought it was the same movie
screenjunkies Sometimes your best friend turns out to be you. Thats the message I took away from this.
screenjunkies well, i disagree with your disagreement. youtube is a harsh world bro
screenjunkies Anyone notice how the black lady was black widow lololol
screenjunkies it truley was a pice of shit.
screenjunkies I actually didnt like it, the over the top pointless action, the generic plot, weak bad guy, stock aliens and transformer robots just didnt click with me.
screenjunkies I disliked the old lady cause she didnt even know what u were talking about
screenjunkies stupid people, this movie is fucking amazing :D
screenjunkies I hated that little girl.
screenjunkies i hated that little girl so ignorant
screenjunkies Hated the little girl...
screenjunkies Its funny how the haters seemed to obviously be people who had no idea what they were watching in the first place XD
screenjunkies Susan Sarandon throwing a punch and saying Boom, just made my day! lol
screenjunkies Hilarious!http:filmdrunk.uproxx.com201203djflulaborgspressjunketmouthfartremixpressjunketinterviews
screenjunkies I think actors promoting their movies must be relieved when a guy like this comes along to break up the monotony of hearing the same questions over and over.
screenjunkies Lolo I like how it goes out of time with itself at one point
screenjunkies What is this shit!?..
screenjunkies You just proved it matters you homophobic fucksack
screenjunkies Crurp theres one on his channel too
screenjunkies tacticalops89 but i am...
screenjunkies Im pretty certain they smoke marijuana
screenjunkies By bragging so intensely, and attempting to aggressively bash another fellow boomer, you have totally defeated the purpose of taking that journey in the first place. No one gives a shit how many shrooms you have taken. Besides, a quarter is not that hard either.
screenjunkies I love them. Eric is hot...
screenjunkies Its a joke you silly billy!
screenjunkies Youre a hog. Cahpesh?
screenjunkies deez niggas is gay im so glad people like you dont get this humor. yes im a comedy elitist
screenjunkies I love their laughs lol
screenjunkies He put it in his opium!
screenjunkies how about a part two just for Sean Bean
screenjunkies 0:32 you should have used the japanese. It was a beautiful death. He knew what happened to it.
screenjunkies Damn music was too loud!
screenjunkies Is the first song from transformers? Im not shure
screenjunkies And I get to tend the rabbits!RIP Lennie... The book and the film were awesome. Although the last lines of the book were so important and the film makers left them out... grumble grumble...
screenjunkies 1:40 transformers, I cired.. :(
screenjunkies Ha, Tommy Wiseau at the end!
screenjunkies 1:10 best moment of the movie. forgot the rest, except the black cook guy being able to survive.
screenjunkies it was from braveheart
GameSack Hahaha, Id love to see more of these!
GameSack Scott and Chris are the best!
GameSack That elevator was freaking annoying.
GameSack This is the best thing ever omg
GameSack I was laughing through the whole video
GameSack Its just not me. Im fussy about music, so Im not a good guide.
GameSack hi man give me the link of the forum where the people wanted to fuck up the blue hound farming I WANT TO CURSE AT THEIR FUCKING MOTHER WHO BORN THEM!!! : THE BIGGEST SHIT WHICH KLEI HAVE EVER MADE!!!::::::::
screenjunkies What is the point of this?
screenjunkies Well, that was unexpected...
screenjunkies My children were watching this and were very disturbed. Please put up a warning of the content before you post. Thankyou
screenjunkies Very fucking stupid, that was very lame!
screenjunkies I think fuck is a F word swell so not so clever after all
screenjunkies How about an Honest Trailer for The Rundown starring Dwayne Johnson...
screenjunkies starship troopers was my and always will be my guilty pleasure lol!
screenjunkies noooooooooooooooo, Forrest Gump is a great movie.....
screenjunkies You missed Leon: The Professional. EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Im surprised  Terminator 2 is compares with any movie as the best of all time. It was so creative  what a storyline!
screenjunkies Best 90s movie?The BIG Lebowski, because, thats like, my opinion, man!
screenjunkies Dear Hal,I would love to see you and your mom watch something again. I think that you should watch: The Room, an episode of Game of Thrones, Project X, or South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.Thats all. Thanks Hal.JaredP.S. It was weird not seeing Nick Mundy completely rage about something.
screenjunkies You missed Mrs. Doubtfire, or Matilda, or basically anything with Mara Wilson.
screenjunkies actually had somehow missed the sixth sense being spoiled until this video, dammit!
screenjunkies A life less ordinary. Ewan McGregor Cameron Diaz, surprisingly great team
screenjunkies Say: youre allright... SHUT THE FUCK UP !!!!!
screenjunkies Say: You know nothing, Jon Snow
screenjunkies Shane, Katnis, Leonardo noOscaro ROFL
screenjunkies Say Side effects may include drowseness and lose of appetite
screenjunkies Please say Ill shake their ass!!! :D
screenjunkies Say: Godammit brain. Why dont you explain why you make me say random things?
screenjunkies Pulp Fiction honest trailer?!?!?!
screenjunkies Pleeease say it rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again
screenjunkies Fuck, I wanted to hear about the guy from Jurrasic Park and Will Smith!
screenjunkies Honestly, Id like it if bigname directors (Bay, M. Night, etc.) got some original movie ideas and let some other people direct the movies for the beloved franchises. Because has there been a single good one yet? Transformers, Avatar the Last Airbender, and Im going to just a assume TMNT is not going to be what we want. Let people who grew up with these franchises and have respect for them take control of their future. Thats what the TMNT show on Nick did and its FANTASTIC. People want to see these movies be good, not just the cashgrabs that they are today.
screenjunkies anti britishmega nerdangry fat guyhardcore transformers fanplainly ignorantvery annoying guest speaker...
screenjunkies So, are Mr. Bays films better when you get a staff interview where the expletive deleted was Nick Mundy for the TMNT review?
screenjunkies Yeah, visualy Pacific Rim got it right. the fights were spectacular but too few and too far apart in my opinion. the transformers fight scenes are unenjoyable jumpcuts, only watched the first one, didnt waste my time and money on the sequels.
screenjunkies They play Linkin Park you dumbass .. its not nickelback!
screenjunkies I agree with everything they said to fix transformers.
screenjunkies Heres an easy solution. Instead of wasting money at the theater, and praying for a miracle, just stay home and play the Transformers: Cybertron games. Even if youve played them 100 times, it will still be a more worthwhile experience than watching Bays Robot Circus again.
screenjunkies 6:40 There i just saved you some time....I recommend watching the whole video though lol
screenjunkies The Prestige and Minority Report, theyre ones I also would have liked to see here.But this was actually a really good idea for a supercut. Well done.
screenjunkies can someone please tell me names of all the movies?
screenjunkies name of the song plzzzzzzzz
screenjunkies Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) ending still freaks me out.
screenjunkies What a twist!! in the comments below!!
screenjunkies 1:53 I havent seen that film, but from that short glimpse, i thought that was James Purefoy in the car, its Thomas Jane, they could easily fit a brothers type of role, eh?
screenjunkies That fuing Argus Filch!
screenjunkies Brans story line is pretty key later on in the books. Do NOT fastforward those parts, yes, its not as exciting as dragons and unexpected deaths, but just wait, Brans abilities kick butt.
screenjunkies I thought that joffrey was a bastard because his mom had him with her brother or something like that. But then again this shit is confusing
screenjunkies My favorite moment in season 3:Tyrions and Sansas wedding. Tyrion basically tells her this shit sucks, so we might as well get it over with and get drunk so that we dont remember it. But even being shitfaced out of his mind, he tells Sansa no and literally tells Tywin to go fuck himself.
screenjunkies at the minute bran is boring bit they need to show what happens with him as his charactet has a vital role later on. it was bittersweet when joff killed ros, her character was boring but super hot. but the best part is EVERYTHING BRONN SAYS
screenjunkies Dude got his dick cut? He must e getting PAID!!!!!
screenjunkies You skipped all of Brans stuff? His stuff is actually very important... soon. Soon.
screenjunkies Geoffrey is an actual bastard.
screenjunkies My favorite part was when Khaleese was all like: Drakaris. And the dragon was all like DIS DOOD IS ON FIREEEEEE
screenjunkies Boobs and swords... swords and boobs... heads roll...
screenjunkies JOFFREY DIES IN SEASON 4
screenjunkies Warning this video contains spoilers from season 1 3 and in the comments everything else.
screenjunkies Awkard moment when you realize that you know all the names of these characters.
screenjunkies You should say It stays crunchy, even in milk if you havent already.
screenjunkies But to all my book bros, RLJ, you know what Im talking about.greatest line ever.
screenjunkies do battleship !!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies to be honest, the little bit with Mike saying its only a mask sold me completelly, hes my favorite turtle by far and i feel like they got it right when it comes to personality.i dont care about the origin story, just because a new movie comes out doesnt mean the old ones disappear, nor do the cartoons, comics and toys, enjoy things for what they are and not for what they might been. if kids gets into the turtles because of this and we see them everywhere again, ill be happy even if the movie is super shitty, that being said the trailer made it look like a lot of fun so ill go watch it for sure.
screenjunkies Wow, and I tought I was fat. But damn that black is fat!!
screenjunkies Michelangelo looks like Shrek lol.
screenjunkies To the people who may see this film  Do whatever you have to do to not support these film makers. Theyve left too many details in the dark as a trap to make you go see it to find out if its any good. And supporting the filmmakers supports that method of releasing movies (or not releasing).
screenjunkies they look like ugly fat babies with shells . . . . .
screenjunkies Their heads are massive
screenjunkies ninja turles  amazing spider man
screenjunkies Ill make a objective decision after I see it, but if this sucks, Michel Bay may lose every fan he ever hoped to have.
screenjunkies i want bebop, rocksteady, craing, baxter stockman the technodrome and dimention X
screenjunkies So much honesty in honest trailers. Didnt realize there was that much lever pulling, switch flicking and percentages! Love it. Perhaps they should do winter soldier now!
screenjunkies dr. strangglove moshi monsters XD
screenjunkies Winter Soldier and The Mask, just cause they were both equally perfect but in different genres (though maybe the winter soldiers better) my opinion.
screenjunkies Winter Soldier please!!!
screenjunkies Captain America: The First Hipster
screenjunkies NO. whats on your mind. I am not a refrigerator
screenjunkies please do divergent !!
screenjunkies Why am I being bombarded with even more commercials by youtube lately? anyone else feel this way?
screenjunkies The hospital sequence in Jacobs Ladder. I think its the furthest I can go with cringeinducing before I turn my head and close my eyes. Also its simultaneously ugly and beautiful. Like a Francis Bacon painting.
screenjunkies the rape of the baby in a serbian film
screenjunkies What about a clock work orange , I spit on your grave , strangeland , or even the fireflys from devils rejects rape sex with dead people a torture pit with a crazy doctor cutting faces off and wearing them some of that is pt 1 house of a 1000 corpses but there are loads of good gruesome clips decent lineup could of had a few Better ones though
screenjunkies the scene where the baby is getting raped in the movie a siberian film
screenjunkies X is for XXL from ABCs of death. that or F, or Z from that same film.
screenjunkies Antichrist. All of it.
screenjunkies the rape scene in irreversible, but also the early scene where cassel bashes the guys head in. that movie is insanely disturbing
screenjunkies Anything directed by Yoshihiro Nishimura e.g. entirety of tokyo gore police.
screenjunkies Altered states. The trip he had when he drank the stuff the native people gave him. He ended up turning into a sand sculpture of him self along with his girl and blowing away in the wind.
screenjunkies What about the last few Fast  Furious?
screenjunkies Do any of the new batman movies!

screenjunkies Street Fighter II the Animated Movie was the BEST video game movie!!
screenjunkies Movies based on videogames will always be bad untill they make a good videogame based on a movie lol
screenjunkies the phoenix wright film was pretty damn perfect.
screenjunkies Silent Hill was good.
screenjunkies I personally loved Final Fantasy the Spirits within.... as a video gamer I appreciated both the 3D rendering... the socalled cold acting and uncanny valley, which I didnt notice , which was inline with the dark world portrayed ... and the ORIGINAL story!
screenjunkies Modern warfare trilogy
screenjunkies I feel like Hit Man with Timothy Olyphant really deserved to be on the list of decent game movies. It was a half decent movie, even without playing the games.
screenjunkies Zelda Movie. Animated Zelda Movie.
screenjunkies Say:  Im gonna punch your face. In the face!
screenjunkies her sister, a merchant, a hot guy and a snowman! XD
screenjunkies Do you wanna build a snowman?
screenjunkies This movie was not that great ppl
screenjunkies wait wait this isnt a honest trailer cuz like she got fucking big in 3 years if its only 3 years....its more like 10 years just 3 years between her mum n dad dying and her sister becoming old enuf to be queen...just saying if you gonna be honest well at lest be honest bros

screenjunkies Im surprised that there are no Tommy Lee Jones Japanese commercials.
screenjunkies Products of their time, and haunting reminders of what they did for money (or what people bought and why). And now, Nicholas Cages crazy is completely well rounded.
screenjunkies This channel is fucking annoying because of this guy. His videos are so fucking biased. All he does is talk shit about actors or movies he doesnt like. Its annoying.
screenjunkies I have to ask where is SPACEMAN JONES.Tommy Lee Jones is SPACEMAN JONES.
screenjunkies man those arny commercials are way way way over my over load limit my brain cant take the SHOCK!!! eeek I better stop thinking about it my head is gonna explode

screenjunkies This movie depressed me for about 2 days after I watched it.
screenjunkies lol convinced me not ot be an astronaught 110000000 kids convinced 99999999 more kids to go xD
screenjunkies Why didnt you cover all of the horrible physics inaccuracies?
screenjunkies I did watch this filme on my phone lol :D
retrogametech Hah, you are like a techno womble or something. Great stuff, good find. I guess most people when something breaks down, they are afraid to even open a plug. We tinkerers though, get out our tool kits.
retrogametech Cant believe it was just the plug, what a score.
retrogametech Wow so lucky! Another great video. I want a Vectrex really bad but they are quite expensive normally and I have little space to put it. Hopefully one day! Kind of funny actually, I recently bought an NES with a plug that looks near identical to that one (wires sticking out, a little rusty etc). It will need replaced soon as it doesnt work so good.
retrogametech I have never heard of a Vectrex before this video. It was before I was born, is that really so surprising?
retrogametech Awesome , been waiting for this since you first tweeted about it a while back.I love your videos man you inspire me to take my consoles repair needs into my own hands. Never paying repair fees again.
retrogametech Thats an awesome console! Please upload some footage when you get a controller working!
retrogametech Nice videos . please make more
retrogametech Amazing find. Great to see a new video from you. Any chance you could do a tutorial on fixing a sega master system model 2 with no power? Ive changed out the voltage regulator but still no luck ( Anyways, thanks for all the informative videos, hope to see more.
retrogametech lovely. nice to have you back, matey!
retrogametech Woo, the day I decide to check his channel for a new video he uploads a new video :D
retrogametech yea seen items like this in poundland, pokemon ones though, you can sometimes see what figure you are getting by peeking in the lil holes at the top. Managed to get a complete set of pokemon legendary figures from poundland
retrogametech Ive been trying to find one of these for a while, but i dont know what they are called.could you tell me what that blue usb programmer is acutely called
retrogametech wheres the chocolate?
retrogametech LOL there sonics balls your holding sonics balls
retrogametech Welcome back, man!! Its really good to see you making videos again
retrogametech Hey martin great to see you back on youtube! happy new year to you too bro:)awesome box of handhelds!  only psp 3ds and gameboy color in my collection:)hopefully you get some time soon to kick back and relax from working so hard!google plus sucks! bro but were all here enjoying your videos! keep going !! you help keep my interest in gaming going :)
retrogametech Nice to see you back! I really enjoy your vids, I stumbled about them kinda accidently when looking for a video on how to replace batteries in gbc games but after watching some of your stuff i decided to stay :D
retrogametech Hey man , you r number 1 on my list ! You r douing grayt stuf , you r explicit  logical ......... goo on , You got style . Thums up !
retrogametech I love your videos. I have a dingoo and love it but the shoulder buttons on it suck and I love the gameboy advances design so I want to merge the two. Ive done some mods in the past nothing too complicated but I have soldering experience from this and school and whatnot so that is not an issue. Any tips or tricks you could give me before I embark? And anywhere you know of that sells just the gba shell or a like 3rd party shell with buttons not just a case? Any help is...helpful.
retrogametech I hate this new comment system! GO TO HELL GOOGLE
retrogametech Omg he has the talk o phone
retrogametech Great to see you back.
retrogametech You have some good old consoles, thats really cool.I do wonder if you play old DOS games like Doom, or Command  Conquer: Red Alert on some old DOS computers.If you do play some old games on old computers, I hope that one day you could some videos about it.If not then you should try it, old computers from the 1990s are really cheap..
retrogametech very cool. im very appreciative of the special guy who sorted me out with a GBA SD cart, i havent even begun to scratch the surface of the games on that thing, but i know itll last me a very, very long time. big love to that guy. :)
retrogametech Glad you got it working, should be a handy tool for you to play about with.
retrogametech Does it auto detect the save type of games that have saves if youre trying to dump them or do you have to look it up online andor guess?
retrogametech Sweet, thanks for sharing this.
retrogametech Why do you have windows XP
retrogametech Do they have this for n64?
retrogametech How do you go about fixing game carts, any ideas anyone?
retrogametech Hey man. On our regional gbforum there was once an article about this smart card. The software to it is called: GBWRITER  you should easily find it on google.
retrogametech I wouldnt call that an early flash card. Since it uses USB, it isnt. Early ones used parallel port. If the USB on that one works good, then it would be fairly late on. The USB attachment I have for the Bung card doesnt work very well.
retrogametech just watched your video.please ask youtuber lukemorse1,he does retro stuff.he is a american that now lives in japan.plus he does mvssnkmotherboards referbs and many other retro systemsgames for his own collection like you.i follow both of you.great channel.:)
retrogametech This is info about CyberDragon : http:danefirm.favore.plphcyberdragonrobertseredyniecki,3045205.html They are located in Poland, they are selling electronic stuff . there is email biurocyberdragon.pl but I am not sure if they will understand engilsh, i can translate it for you if you will write it in eng.
retrogametech I remember having something like this but the box that plugged into the PC used a serial port xD If I remember correctly I used some sort of FTP like software to flash games to it using Windows ME.(Also this is shockwave952s other account. I would comment with shockwave952 but Ive been locked out of the comment section for not linking with G, sigh...)
retrogametech I like my EZFlashIV until I discovered the other week you have to patch the damn games using some weird Chinese program that doesnt exist for Mac! I completely forgot you had to do that!!
retrogametech I still have the software by the way, and some of the older revisions, as they could cause problem with certain games sometimes
retrogametech The Hyper Neo 64 deserved more games than it got.
retrogametech SNK Arcade kill me just how big they are lol!
retrogametech i think watching your videos gave me ebay luck or something crazy i got an awesome deal on a fully boxed Perfect Dark on the n64 book and everything amazing condition for 15 by far the best deal i have ever seen on ebay i userally see boxed PDs go for 30 Oo
retrogametech Glad you liked it! I also figured out how to improve the video quality for next time :)
retrogametech Metroid Fusion is by far my favourite GBA game.
retrogametech I like the new format! It makes more sense than the old one.
retrogametech The second Lilo  Stitch game is what I expected the first to be, some form of platformer.
retrogametech Thanks, and already working on it )
retrogametech No way!, I love bootlegs! Haha. Ive been building up a nice little collection of them over the last few months. You can find some really weird ROM hacks and cool cartridge art.
retrogametech Thanks! Im going to try and up the capture footage for next time.
retrogametech Lilo and Stitch was my first GBA game, when it was new. Fiendishly difficult when youre about 67! (as a side note my first PS2 game was Dark Chronicle: my parents seemed to like buying me obscure games).
retrogametech You mentioned that your WIi is softmodded, but not your PS2 (I assume). If you have a fat PS2, you really should install an IDE hard drive and get it softmodded. Its very easy, and shouldnt even take 15 minutes.
retrogametech I could hear the CRT before you showed it. Drives me crazy!
retrogametech Great set up! But Im sure theres space to add a wonderful Wii U 32GB. Just the black gamepad in its stand would look awesome in your setup )
retrogametech love the channel... what media player is that ... looks tiny would go great in my man cave
retrogametech Ive been holding out on one of those for a little while now. Id like to wait for the hardware and software to develop just a little further before jumping in. They look pretty sweet though! You got any recommendations?
retrogametech that sega genesis (?)  mega drive is a bulky beast! I remember seeing the tv infomercials here in the states trying to promote the elaborate, cumbersome setup and sell it to gamers. You might have the only one in the UK, mate! Great setup although i have to ask, do you ever get grief from old school nintendo fans? No retro setup is complete without an old SNES according to most US gamers. Alas, i only kept my gamecube.
retrogametech quick question mate.. how much did your unit cost you in total? its ikea yes?
retrogametech Haha, good to know. Thanks :)
retrogametech Haha, repurposing. :P
retrogametech You should make a response too! :) Im sure you have some weird and interesting stuff in your collection, haha
retrogametech alright martin, i just posted my videoresponse yesterday )
retrogametech Its a cool little device. Ill try and make a vid about it soon :)
retrogametech lol at the third item, you should wall mount it... :D
retrogametech Something youve ever considered picking up? Its would work perfectly with your supergun setup.
retrogametech I dont own any cabs. Lack of space is the biggest factor :P
retrogametech Awesome video, really interesting to learn about this as i had never heard of it before
retrogametech What games do you have gor it? I know their wernt many
retrogametech These have been selling for peanuts for years! I remember picking a NOS board with 2 NOS games (In boxes) for around 30 around 5 years ago! Must me 1000s left! :D I no longer have a kit but I think the games dont look to bad and for the price definitely worth investigating in the kit! Even if it is massive!
retrogametech seen these on ebay was going to get one but didnt for some reason, cool system but not many games available for them, cool none the less
retrogametech I cant hear anything...
retrogametech Yeah definitely. Shoot me a PM dude.
retrogametech Haha, just as well you did! Within about 6hrs of me posting this vid I noticed all his remaining stock was sold.
retrogametech Thanks, I appreciate the nice comment!
retrogametech What bit did you need? Id like to open one I got for free.
retrogametech Looked really nice and clean in the end. I have the light blue Halo 4 controllers that came with the Halo 4 custom shell console. Really nice, but it can be a little distracting when the batteries start to run out and the LEDs start flashing, due to the clear material. But Im nitpicking really, they are really nice. Have you been playing GTA 5? Ive been loving it so far, just a shame you cant install the 2nd disc without texture issues (ifwhen I get a spare 16GB USB Ill install to that).
retrogametech can you fix my gba sp screen please
retrogametech I wish you could fix my control. Id pay to have it fix.
retrogametech Excellent repair. YouTube has buggered the comments so I cant read what other people have written. I can see there are 33 comments here when I write mine. A nice feature :P
retrogametech Haha, maybe Ill take the camera with me next time I go out to the shed.
retrogametech You used motor oil on what?
retrogametech With all the recent horrible YouTube updates, I can reassuringly say that it isnt a bug anymore, Larry. Theyve gone and screwed everything up again, like usual.
retrogametech That sucks but its also really interesting to me. I love seeing all the weird clone variations people came up with.
retrogametech Yup, its Russian import
retrogametech Lets put pokemon on it.. because... video games!
retrogametech Sega CD addon definitely doesnt work with it :(
retrogametech Have you ever seen a decent NES clone with similar 60hz, region switches. I love my NES  original pal games but they play super slow? Makes me sad.
retrogametech Can it run Sega CD, or 32x?
retrogametech I did wonder about this clone, glad you investigated before I did!!
retrogametech Yes, I have collection of clones. The video about NES clones is in montage now. A short teaser about it is in my channel)
retrogametech I found a 2tb one in a tv recorder plus it is now used for my desktop that i built
retrogametech how many DS games do you have? there are over 1700 north american releases!
retrogametech Thanks for the update. I love your channel.
retrogametech Can you do a video review on your multimedia box usb
retrogametech I wish nintendo would add a second analog stick and upgrade the resolution on both screens. Also they should increase the battery to 2000 mAh :D
retrogametech Yes but Im not sure how the best way to do it would be. Ideally Id like to show a little gameplay of each game as I show them but that seems like a lot of work. Suggestions are welcome :)
retrogametech i found a jail broken ps3 in a gamestop dumpster the ps3 start fucking up after a few weeks so i just took that hdd out and put it in my other ps3
retrogametech Have you seen like american dumpster dives at gamestops? Have you ever tried doing it like Game or something?
retrogametech Are you bored of gaming???? Maybe time to get rid of it all like i did :(
retrogametech This may sound creepy, but I love your voice.
retrogametech you can adjust the strap on the guitar hero grip. fits my ginormous hands, so shouldnt be a problem for you as well.
retrogametech Woah good job on the gameboy
retrogametech My brother has a gameboy, Its blue, has duct tape all around the back because he lost the battery thing and the screen protector fell off XD Still works completely fin though.
retrogametech Surprisingly Guitar Hero: On Tour Decades is a good game.
retrogametech Alright thanks man! Ive been watching, just not commenting. I was thinking of getting all the variants for my collection but didnt have money at that time.
retrogametech The bigger cases for PAL games (PS1,Dreamcast,DS) is usually down to them needing to fit the big European multilingual manuals inside.
retrogametech Thanks! Hope you like the vids :)
retrogametech I do but no reason to bust it open at the moment. Ill keep an eye out for some faulty units to repair though :)
retrogametech I literally found my ags 101 when I was 7(5 years ago) in a clothing shop under a stack of blue jeans. It had a few scratches at the time and it was lucky I even found myself a free sp.
retrogametech doubt it was the blacklit model...
retrogametech If you keep away from eBay as a seller, where do you sell things?
retrogametech i already know this they sold them in nz also
retrogametech I remember my cousin having one too ) (Im Canadian as well P)
retrogametech So your saying these were quite rare? i had two when i was 7 and i live in the uk
retrogametech great job martin, i would have done the same thing, that first neogeo just didnt seems like it was worth repairing so using it for parts seems like a good idea )
retrogametech Haha, thanks dude. It fit surprisingly well!
retrogametech I actually used to do a lot of modsrepairs for other people. But theres really no money in it. You have to factor in the time spent on each job. Forget about repairs, just diagnosing a fault can take hours! And even seemingly simple jobs canwill eat up the hours. Then of course theres the cost of parts, materials and shipping etc. In most cases just to earn the equivalent to the UKs legal hourly minimum wage, Id have to charge people far more than theyd be willing to pay. Not worth it IMO
retrogametech Your videos rock! I think the powerswitch modification should add to the value as now it has parts from the mighty Mega Drive! bows before his 4 Megadrives
retrogametech Thanks, Ed. I think the damaged corner and ghetto power switch probably killed the value :P. I would have expected a little more for it too but the market seems really dead right now. Especially on expensive nonessential items like an AES. Considering what I paid for it I was kinda tempted just to keep it for myself. But need the cash and space more than a Neo Geo right now, haha. And I have a bad habit of buying stuff to sell then keeping it for my own collection! :P
retrogametech Thanks! Its always really cool to hear when someone enjoys the content and discovers something new because of it. :) Yes, mostly selftaught through trial and error and Googling anything I dont understand. Fixing the old consoles isnt very difficult :) Thanks for watching and taking the time to comment!
retrogametech Its a brilliant game and probably one of the best 8bit platformers every made. The original is extremely rare and highly sought after so commands crazy prices )
retrogametech I... have no clue really.
retrogametech Time to support WayForward with their Kickstarter for Shantae: HalfGenie Hero!!
retrogametech Im guessing youre a big fan of WayForward. I dont blame, I love their games!
retrogametech Thats awesome thanks man.
retrogametech Cheers! Glad you like them :)
retrogametech please can u do a 3ds review video because Im thinking of getting one
retrogametech Haha, the biggest! I have most of their releases. Some of the best games Ive ever played.
retrogametech this video has a really high ringing sound permeating it. its quite offputting.
retrogametech No, I dont know what that is.
retrogametech awesome video, Ive wanted a scorpion ever since I seen one on a video game Television program years and years ago, Youre a ninja with the tech stuff, I always learn a ton from your videos!
retrogametech Great video, well you did get further than bad influnce ever did :) are you aware that here is also an 8 bit scorpion
retrogametech You cant make Sonic run too fast.. Dont be silly...
retrogametech Im impressed you got the 32X working at all on a clone machine. The 32X is EXTREMELY picky when it comes to signal quality from the MD. I had to modify my VA4 PAL MD to give cleaner data signals to the 32X from the MD, otherwise the 32X wouldnt run reliably.
retrogametech Well, its the 32X so nothing of value has been lost lol.
retrogametech i am a guy and dont understand that stuff so relax
retrogametech hi good day the red steel game . have you had a chance to use the motion plus controller compared to the old one .. and if you have is they any difference to the game play .
retrogametech Also check out Metal Jesus Rocks. I think he has 3 Wii hidden gems vids that helped me out alot. Also the guys cool as fuck.
retrogametech no more heros is really good
retrogametech Neo geo collection a must have mate....
retrogametech Wii party, muramasa, and definitively super smash brothers brawl!!
retrogametech Yeah, Ive heard a few people say its good. Does it use the Wiimotes motion sensor to control the car?
retrogametech the first is so much better
retrogametech Never came out over here, Excite trucks almost as good though I guess (also really cheap)
retrogametech Smash Bros. Brawl using a Gamecube controller is great fun.
retrogametech any chance to use this as a flash cart?
retrogametech 3:57 far cry 3 blood dragon soundtrack
retrogametech Best soundtrack ever! Power Glove are awesome.
retrogametech Sweet little add on  they go for 1525 on eBay!
retrogametech I would of grabbed it for 98p, i have never heard of these before. Very random, but worth having.
retrogametech its a good find ive thrown more change away
retrogametech Not bad for 98p, eh? :)
retrogametech I forgot that the 3DS could play music.
retrogametech That looks awesome! Ive never seen anything like that over here in the US, though. Id buy one if they sold em in stores here...
retrogametech Andy crane...blast from the past
retrogametech The worst thing you can do is play the Wing Fortress level of Sonic 2, its just so bad.
retrogametech I know your called RetroGameTech but are you going to be buying the android gaming console OUYA?
retrogametech Ideally you need to get a scope and logic analyser onto the job and compare signals to working MD and 32x. Could be a noisy  different sync signal or something. Also possible timing difference somewhere else on the scorp  maybe that jumper on its own for 60hz isnt enough? Presumably youve tried 50hz with 32x? Great vids btw!
retrogametech Made in Taiwan!. All those Megadrive clones was made in Taiwan!!!!
retrogametech I doubt there really was a Magic 1. I think they were just trying to make it look more like a Model 2 Mega Drive by calling it a Magic 2 and using the same font :P.
retrogametech Please use a mic... could barely understand you!
retrogametech Without looking  cheating the on web, i think that was called Midnight Pumpkin. Certainly good timescarefree.I used to race my pal who had a Grasshopper (i think it was called).Mine wast good around cornershis was! : Keep up the good work on the vids, its all good stuff.
retrogametech That thing is rather cool looking. Great video!
retrogametech Wow. Thats got to be the deal of the decade. You almost never see NeoGeo AESs on ebay or heck, anywhere. Awesome stuff, and I hope you fixed them. :)
retrogametech Cheers! :) The prices for some AES games is obscene! Very cool console but prohibitively expensive :( MVS FTW! :)
retrogametech Hey Martin, I always enjoy your vids about more exotic (at least here in europe) consoles. What happened to your TurboGrafx? Even a short vid about your experience with it and your opinion would be really appreciated!
retrogametech Thanks dude. Pretty happy with the outcome :)
retrogametech tried to PM and failed. Hi I just want to ask you something technical... I have got an extra NES console... And I want to convert it to a famicom. I disabled the NEs10 chip. Other than soldering a 60 pin connector to main board, do I need to do any thing else? Because I have seen some converters from old NES carts and they all have a chip on it. And I dont know if a direct solderin would work?
retrogametech Nice buys there, I was going to ask, if you would consider selling the big on button and the slider (I found an AES at a car boot sales a few years ago, it was in pieces but as I found out it worked but was missing the two switches), no problem if you want to keep them, I also have a few ngage goodies I could trade if you prefer. Anyway, keep up the good work.
retrogametech Wow man. Nice surprise video.
retrogametech Awesome fix, Martin! I might be able to buy one of those consoles off of you.
retrogametech Why do you have the scan lines
retrogametech Where did you get these? Ebay?
retrogametech I really need to pick up some component cables for my Wii, Ive made use of composite as Ive really not played it all that much over the last few years. But I imagine something like Wind Waker would look amazing through component, especially in comparison to the woeful composite... And theres really no excuse, considering how cheap the cables are. Its not like trying to source Gamecube component cables O0
retrogametech Haha, and that wasnt a slip of the tongue. Ive always called it either Xbox 1 or teh original Xbox. What were Microsoft thinking when they came up with that stupid new name. What a great way to confuse customers.
retrogametech Thanks. I think stuff like this is pretty niche. I doubt many people want to listen to me talk about whats behind my TV :P
retrogametech I think its probably one of the best :)
retrogametech It gives better detail in older games. On HDTV 16 bit games look really blocky and colors blend together. With scan lines it gives better separation to make them look really sharp.
retrogametech no warranty, ms i loathe ms custmer support and i dont wanna pay over 100 to fix it
retrogametech Ah. I see. Also, how do you hook up so many systems without causing electrical hazards? And why do you use those SCART switchers?
retrogametech Wii has some of the best games Ive ever played (DKCR being my favourite). Such a great system.
retrogametech Got to love the WII lightgun games.
retrogametech I like how you store your game boy color games. I have started a collection of the GB cartridges and I got some good deals from uk online store gamerascal. Check out my video if you wish.
retrogametech great video! dead or alive has to be the only series of fighting games i cant get into : ive been trying to play it on the vita but i just cant figure it out for some reason, maybe its because im so used to capcom fighters like umvc3, and the main 3D game i play is tekken. i might get doa5 on the ps3 so i can play on my stick and maybe thatll help but its kinda hard to get used to the counter system...you should do a beginners guide video!
retrogametech gameboy multicarts! I wantz :(
retrogametech with what are you recording?
retrogametech We all love your videos dude ! we can all send martin some red bull to give you energy to keep them up ! great pick ups love the wii shooters too ! your right now is a great time for some wii bargains !! pick up epic mickey despite a few flaws its a great platformer ! )
retrogametech you should try and find Metroid Prime Trilogy, you should be able to get it for 10 to 20 pounds, its 3 games in one and if you NEVER played the first 2, its the bast way to play
retrogametech Totally addicted to your videos Martin, had a look around for more channels like this but cant seem to find any with quite the same quality. Keep up the good work mate )
retrogametech have you done a video replacing the battery on a gameboy cart?
retrogametech wow well done wish was gifted at repairs like you man
retrogametech Not only is it awesome that youre able to fix these but youre showing other people its possible to save some of these so dont throw them away so hastily!
retrogametech After the nuclear fallout there the world will be populated by cockroaches and Mega Drives
retrogametech I think it shows how determined he was in fixing it more than how resilient the console was. :p
retrogametech Same here bro, i moved from uk to morrinsville, nz, a couple years back and the market is non existent here. Where I use to live I was 10 minutes away from two shops which specialised in nother but retro games. eBay and trademe are my options now. When i can i also look for car boot sales in the hope theres some things there aswell.
retrogametech Your skills are amazing...I watch all your videos and you help me improving my fixing skills...Keep on the good job...
retrogametech think wire glue (or any conductive glue) placed over the traces would have fixed it? Minus the capacitor that will obviously need a little work.
retrogametech Do u JTAG consoles locally?
retrogametech this is a great video, thanks man
retrogametech Thanks Luke. I couldnt find that tut you mentioned. Where abouts on the site is it and Ill throw a link into the description along with the others. Love these controllers! They have a really satisfying click to them and are perfectly shaped.
retrogametech i swear i find the the dpad from neo geo Cd controllers the best dpad ever made, shame it breaks a lot :(
retrogametech Just regular cleaning items, nothing fancy. I normally just mix some shampoo into very hot water. Throw all the parts in and leave them to sit for 5min. After that I use an old tooth brush to scrub all the dirtgrim off. Works great! :)
retrogametech Glad you like them :)
retrogametech Thanks! Sometimes I wonder if making these vids will actually just bore the crap outta people, haha. Its really nice to hear when someone says they enjoyed watching. Cheers!
retrogametech Nothing, it just needed cleaned and reseated. Sticky buttons, a common issue with all controllers if theyre not kept clean. :)
retrogametech Cheers for watching and taking the time to comment! :)
retrogametech Looks much better now, at the start it looked like it would be safer to handle with rubber gloves.
retrogametech Thanks, looking forward to having a physical version
retrogametech LOL, you make bootleggers(that do it as a business) look like amateurs.
retrogametech It would be pretty awesome to modify the case of a Sega Megadrive and put new hardware inside. Then make a cardridge with some USB stick inside which contains the actual installed game :P Then you basicly have your own next gen retro console for which you can make these bootlegs XD Atleast it would do more than sit at your shelf. Ive seen people do that with a NES so it should be doable with a Megadrive though its kinda small and tricky to get everything fitting. New project idea for you? :)
retrogametech A nice idea. Executed well. Good stuff Martin
retrogametech Looks awesome, adding a cart would be nice touch. Have you thought about doing any others?
retrogametech Mint mate, looks cracking :)
retrogametech I need to finish this game!
retrogametech if you look on YouTube some guys got the rom for this and rebuild the server so you can play like it is 1994 , i think emu only :( , Snes has this to it did games shows sat radio and more , you could even get Zelda link to the past 2 , 3ds one is not 2
retrogametech Hey Martin sorry to bother you but I have been watching your videos for some time now, and you seem fairly knowledgeable about video game consoles, So if you wouldnt mind answer a question for me. I have a sega master system first gen. that has been sitting up for some time now almost 2 years, Recently I hooked it up and it works its just when i play games the colors change on every game. I have cleaned them and everything so if you have an idea please help.
retrogametech Thanks! I appreciate that. Thanks for watching the vids! :)
retrogametech Nice i see you have the official wireless controller box on your model one thats nice i should get a modem and try it out.
retrogametech Haha, Technically we still can. xD Just need to gather a community of people with modems and copies of CyberBall organised. :P But it would be cool if the SEGA servers were still up and you could download the games etc )
retrogametech I remember seeing a advert for in the mean machines magazine back in the 90s. Pretty cool you tracked one down today. Awesome vid.
retrogametech What a neat piece of hardware. Its amazing how many things Japan got that we never did. Even if it didnt succeed, it would have been nice to have a chance at it. Its like the Nintendos FDS never seeing light in America. Its a shame they didnt give it a chance.
retrogametech How much have you paid for your boxed set?
retrogametech So the internets has been lying to me? i feel violated.
retrogametech Soooo.... how do you access that hidden service menu? Would love to fix my Trinitron screen!
retrogametech wasnt me. sorry i dont like or dislike videos usually. rgb and component can do 1080p? dont really think there is much different between them.
retrogametech Im pretty sure all Trinitrons have RGB input.
retrogametech imo same as this generations... last gen xbox vs ps2 xbox still had halo forza etc and some others but hes right on the saturn its the perfect 2d console overall its just it was wedged between past gen and next gen i think it would be 45th gen systems so it didnt work out so well and a pain to make games for it
retrogametech You make a valid argument for modern televisions, but I still think youre crazy )
retrogametech For a complete Sony CRT of this quality and condition with the remote? 15 is less than the cost of most video games! Are you mad? :P You should see the pixel perfect picture quality this thing produces now I have it fully optimised. Id put money on you drooling.
retrogametech The point of SCART is that it would have replaced all those other formats (SVideo, Composite, etc), and is much better quality to boot. Its not just those other types of cables in 1 wire, its an entirely different format. Kamen is wishing wed started with that from the beginning, so we wouldnt have Component or any of that other stuff, as there is literally no reason to use it over SCART. Its like how we should have switched to Metric, instead of Imperial. :)
retrogametech That looks like a TV...... only smaller! :D :D The THREE dots on the SCART socket means its RGB (for your future reference). Each dot mean the R, G  B lines. I could see the scanlines when you zoomed in.... the size of the screen will make them less visible. If you turn the contrast down, they should become more prominant.
retrogametech I found on of these in my apartments bin. Was in good working condition.
retrogametech This was very interesting and I do agree that it looks better with scanlines, thanks for the video.
retrogametech The dreamcast port of SFA3 looks pretty good.
retrogametech Nice video, would this work between a vga box to a vga2hdmi scaler box or would the hdmi scaler get rid of the scanlines. ?? Thanks
retrogametech Thats maybe got more to do with my cameras white balance compensating for the switching. If it looks too dark with scalines then you can just adjust your TVs backlight, contrast and brightness settings.
retrogametech I always play retro games on a small 14 inch crt tv, so i dont really see the scanline spaces, the beam is too thick to leave gaps. on a bigger tv on the other hand, like 20 inches or if you stand really close to the action like with an arcade cabinet its more distinct. i have never seen scanlines as the biggest difference between crt and lcd tvs, its something else. for me maybe its more about the colors, lack of lag, that theres no native resolutions and the analog feel of it.
retrogametech lol, I search SLG 3000 on Ebay and Amazon, and all I get is fire trucks..
retrogametech I am trying to get rid of those scanlines on my crt . With 60Hz rgb you get those on a pal TV.
retrogametech Just fired up my Dreamcast through RGB with a scanline generator for the first time a few minutes ago.. bloody hell, lol. Very pretty.
retrogametech Looks great. If my Trinitron ever kicks the bucket, Im picking one up.
retrogametech So what happens if you answer the phone?
retrogametech HAHA that is awesome.
retrogametech Sega was ahead of its time. They brought the technology to our living rooms to enjoy the worlds first 16Bit Technology
retrogametech NGage it an excellent console. You should check it out.
retrogametech Nice :) But you might want to block out the number at 1:37
retrogametech Nice, I wonder if you could get the saturn modem working over here in the UK? Ive always wanted to try Duke Nukem  Sega Rally online with the saturn.
retrogametech call Microsoft support then just let the magic happen
retrogametech it look like your sega is getting gang raped
retrogametech Nice vid, very effective :) What car are you driving?
retrogametech What a great video. I love all these videos showing off the beauty of Scotland.
retrogametech Its beautiful out there, also nice driving.
retrogametech I could do it ) Martins Outrun 2013.....
retrogametech Eyup, its March and I cant always get to Dundee because of the roads :(
retrogametech Its a lot of fun to drive out there. Even better in the snow :)
retrogametech The snow was hellish bad up here in Stonehaven also, nice vid
retrogametech My in Scotland thats bad try Montana )
retrogametech Hah you fixed it then traded it in at GAME!
retrogametech The ebay seller was from doncaster near me :) great vids
retrogametech It might be where you are. Around here(still in the USA), all the game stores will offer cash. Of course, the trade in value they offer is higher since they arent exactly handing you real money.
retrogametech the backlight of my touch screen is not working on my 3ds, it works perfectly fine if you apply pressure to the bottom left of the screen. any suggestions?
retrogametech can i buy one of the ds lites?
retrogametech Which cable was it actually?
retrogametech Oh god, the gymnastics required to handle the two in the DSi XL was enough to drive me nuts. I have a few DS Lite repairs coming up and I was relieved to find that they also have one ribbon and a bit more room to route it.
retrogametech Wow! You have a pretty great monitor!
retrogametech You money is worth a lot more than here in the US
retrogametech i loved you videos so much i bought an ngage qd on ebay. now im waiting for it to arrive, can you please do a top 10 or top 5 (whatever you like) games so i know what to get in time for the consoles arrival. also, is there any accesories you have that would go with it well.
retrogametech Would love to see some gameplay on what you would consider the best game graphically, really interested in what the NGage could do!
retrogametech the collection is cool! do you still have it?
retrogametech could you tell us how much you gave for civilization and sega rally and maybe tell us a bit about how you got them, maybe some in the past that you almost got or were outbid? the part of collecting that i like is the stories that go along with it. the stories are quite possibly as good as the item itself! thanks for posting. im pleased to see that you found all of them. when you made the video looking for civilization, i looked on the web periodically to help but no avail.
retrogametech Collin mcrea rally 2005
retrogametech Ive never played an NGage but to see a complete collection is really cool. A few questions: could you still get an NGage activated on a wireless plan and use it as a phone? Are you planning on getting all the games sealed too? Can you do some gameplay footage of Sonic N? I love Sonic games but Ive never seen that one...
retrogametech I wanna see ngage gameplay
retrogametech Im curious to know, how much was your entire collection?
retrogametech Id like to see gameplay for the rifts game. I hear its based on the old pen and paper game.
retrogametech OMG I HAVE THAT CONTROLler my thumbsticks are a bit broke from my fps Greeks but there ok
retrogametech Hey Cool video, I have the same halo 4 controllers and limited edition 360 on my channel. I show a video of me putting my modsticks into it. Plz check it out btw I subbed your channel!
retrogametech great video nice looking controller.
retrogametech I thought you were about to play a tune on the battery terminals.
retrogametech Can I have you joysticks mine are wearing out
retrogametech Man those 360 controllers are a bit more busy inside than the MegaDrive and SNES ones Im used to :D
retrogametech I was playing the 3DS version last night, it definitely seems very similar to this. I made a 3DS from parts of broken ones I bought on eBay after being inspired by your lets repair videos :)
retrogametech Brilliant game thats for sure :)
retrogametech Thanks dude! Glad you enjoyed it. I know you have some high standards for LP vids. Happy to have gained your approval :P
retrogametech Whats your opinion on Dead or Alive 2 Ultimate for Xbox? What do you think of the modern Ninja Gaiden games, since they share a connection?
retrogametech I still have this game, but the disc doesnt work anymore. Well, not this exact version, I have the NA release. My friend had (probably still has) DOA2: Hardcore for PS2, and whenever we got together, wed challenge each other. I preferred HayateEin, while he went with Ayane.The bonus features that the PS2 version had were image galleries with the same images as the Dreamcast version had when you put the disc in a PC. I dont know if it maybe had more outfits. I unlocked them all on my game.
retrogametech Not so much high standards, more just genuine effort and thought ) I dont even like the DoA games but you made this entertaining to watch so that makes it a success to me!
retrogametech The SLG does appear to give the illusion of adding extra definition to almost all Dreamcast games. For example JSR, DoA, MSR and Daytona all look better despite not being typical 2D sprite based games. They look amazing over VGA anyway but the SLG just gives a little extra definition. But, I think its all down to personal preferencesetups. I didnt like the results of SLG  SaturnMega Drive. I prefer a clean, sharp and unaltered image on those. Ive still to test some SEGA emus on the DC..
retrogametech Thank you. Im glad you enjoyed it :)
retrogametech Thanks for putting this up what was  is the camera ?
retrogametech Thanks, glad you liked it.
retrogametech Not sure which ones youre referring to but if theyre near a pedestrian crossing it means no stoppingparking.
retrogametech Thanks for posting my hometown, you drove past my folks house too !! :) Im a bit more out in the stix now mind you ! Not far from your good self. Keep up the great work.
retrogametech The guy in the corsa in front for a while looks dodgy
retrogametech Love the vid and music, you may also like Wavestar  John Dyson
retrogametech No, you can only frontlight those unfortunately.
retrogametech Those are 2 of the easiest points youll find.
retrogametech Certainly beats strapping a clumsy light to the system
retrogametech I remember plugging in a tiny angler fish lamp into my game boy so I could play Super Mario Land 2 at night! Good times! I need to get myself a gameboy! Because after I watched this video I found my old gameboy games! haha
retrogametech where did you get the clear gameboy shells?
retrogametech I mean, a discreet front lighting or some kind.
retrogametech Thank you very much! )
retrogametech Thats an awesome mod to an original Gameboy (it makes it look better than without a backlight. Could you do a video on how to make a backlight for the Gameboy Pocket?
retrogametech Is it possible to do a backlight mod on the Neogeo pocket?
retrogametech I might consider selling it if it didnt have all my saves from the last couple of years stores on it :P
retrogametech oh lol, well then I have a video to watch later
retrogametech Ah, I remember you compared the two side by side at some point, I suppose that sports edition was a loaner.
retrogametech Man, thats so awesome, the VMUs had such a cut design, I wish theyd sold MP3 players in the shape of VMU, Id sooo much buy that shit D:
retrogametech You should make a vid :)
retrogametech cool mod mate, never really thawt about doing this 2 my vmus, i have an old backlit casio watch wonder if i can take it apart maybe tricky on something that small
retrogametech Very cool, I never had a VMU in the Dreamcast days. Funny how the WiiU essentially has the 2013 version of the idea.
retrogametech Lol, happens to me too. I just dont make vids when it goes badly wrong :P
retrogametech DraculaX is SuperCD only on PCE
retrogametech Why cant I get deals like this!?!?
retrogametech Hey! Love your videos, really fun to watch and your voice is so calm and relaxing! Great work! :) Random question, what kind of watch do you have? Really random but Im looking after a new watch and I liked the one you got, haha :) Keep up the good work, Im a fan!
retrogametech Good job. Hey even if you couldnt get it working it would have been worth if for the box and the housing of that TG16
retrogametech Thanks! Luckily it was a pretty simple fix :)
retrogametech The UK version does composite out as standard. Thats about its only advantage over the US version, though. :P
retrogametech So what was wrong with it? Was it EPROM?
retrogametech If apple made the NES, they would DEFINATELY have a lawsuit for this console
retrogametech Ebay Junk??? WTF!!! EBAY GOLD!!! sweet score!
retrogametech No Wise fom oor gwaaaaaavvv
retrogametech Depends on the game but nowadays MVS carts are worth a fraction of what theyd have originally cost an arcade operator. You can easily pick up some titles for under 2030. The reverse is now the case for the AES home console carts. Look and see how much the same copy of Metal Slug will cost you on the AES! :P
retrogametech StrykerEG Check out Bomb Factory  How Do You Feel? Exciter...basically, the whole album lol :)
retrogametech seems like it would be more work than its worth. Ive seen MVS boards, many rom chips. would have to be desoldered and then all that
retrogametech Nope, I keep finding more interesting projects to work on. Its sitting half complete in the shed :P
retrogametech U need more Saturn games dude!
retrogametech BK3 is excellent! Id love to get a copy of the directors cut sometime. That clone MD couldnt be fixed unfortunately. Its still in my collection though :)
retrogametech Space Harriers looks like Kid Icarus: Uprising on 3DS :)
retrogametech You dont have to use that programmer, do you? Im pretty sure you can take the cartridge itself, with the cartridge to computer things, and then upload the game onto it. It makes sense, because in your cuter videos, you have thoose.
retrogametech Can you make a tutorial about this
retrogametech Sick project!!! Keep up the good work
retrogametech The clue is in its title screen :P
retrogametech man you are getting a sub from me because when i found your channel recently before i was always searching for stuff like you to on youtube and it is in one big bundle :3
retrogametech Where did u get that 64MB flash card?
retrogametech Are you going to be doing any more videos on this? Its very cool and Im rally interested in it and would love to see more videos.
retrogametech could you make a gameboy game cartridge that reads games off a SD card?
retrogametech I wanted to put some ROMs on cartridges, but I want the thing to look authentic, and not be a regular sd flashcart. I was wondering where the chips and flasher could be purchased so that I could try to flash a chip, and install it in a cartridge
retrogametech If you are interested in making GB Flashcarts for homebrew, let me know. I have worked on it in the past (have a video somewhere) and am working on an updated kit.
retrogametech I love these videos, nostalgic times.
retrogametech What temperature is the soldering iron set to? Im guessing its not too hot. Thanks
retrogametech Ice got an original Gameboy Color if anybody wants to buy it?
retrogametech fixing a dead machine isnt free either
retrogametech I knew immediately when you said that it had the horizontal black bar, that you had no game inserted. No, it has nothing for you to do without a game. I dont know of any cartridge consoles that had any form of an interactive OS without the game cartridge. Also, youll never see game save datetime on this thing. Good luck kind sir!
retrogametech Id advice just buying a new one off ebay. Probably about 5 to 8 bucks and it will make it look a lot newer.
retrogametech I have a new game boy green, can anyone want?
retrogametech Im watching this and dont even have a Game Boy. So interesting!
retrogametech Lots of mystery Christmas packages going around, love it. Great stuff guys! )
retrogametech Iron Bru is the best drink EVER! :D
retrogametech Interesting stuff there man. yeah, ill give it a shot for sure with the game and maybe it will cause some kind of trippy effect lol.
retrogametech Im from Scotland , obviously or I wouldnt be wasting my time. But I dont drink so I couldnt care less about whisky, For someone your age to be concerned with something as trivial as deep fried mars bars is pretty feeble, what about the game of golf which we also invented, do your homework pal. I doubt very much you have gotten any wiser since you were my age
retrogametech If only they had taco bells in Scotland lol
retrogametech much love from europe xD
retrogametech Now at walmart, not sure if they have them where you are, but they have these hardshell security boxes. So now you have to get it out of the box, then out of the wrapping, then 3 big ass stickers before you can open it. Dreamcast had the best game cases... i dont even know why we need dvd cases anymore for games. Just throw it in a jewel case.
retrogametech for sure bro. the amount of sugar in the one bar alone had me spinning for 30min. Insane how much sugar was actually in it...wait, it was ALL sugar :
retrogametech bro, you have no idea. The amount of sugar in that one bar was about a weeks intake. Supper buzzing now lol.
retrogametech I just tried it and I can watch Bayonetta 2 fine.Its 1pm, odd
retrogametech I guess this is how Nintendo plans on pushing the hardcore games they promised with the WiiU. Good job Nintendo. Perhaps parents should have the responsibility of monitoring their children instead of Nintendo trying to do it for us.
retrogametech Nintendo has always been heavy on censorship, their arcade ports in the 90s were almost always the censorship versions, and more so thanks to the current fad about complainingprotesting about gender identity.
retrogametech Ohhhhh this annoys me so much. Absolutely ridiculous. I swear Nintendo are in their own little bubble. Where is the logic in this decision? Theyre shooting themselves in the foot here.
retrogametech Just another example of why I just cant take Nintendo seriously as an adult gamer. If they want buyers to believe they arent just catering to kids, theyre going entirely the wrong way about it.
retrogametech Youre right, they should have set the restrictions in line with the parental controls, and not do a server wide ban.Theyll no doubt reverse it though.
retrogametech I cant be bothered to write much about this as it would turn into and essay so I will sum it up in one word STUPID !!!
retrogametech Everytime i was gonna watch Nintendo 3D Show,it asks me for my age.I already set it already and it still asks me to put my fing age
retrogametech I think if the parental options are off then people can view all the mature things they want!
retrogametech Oh I didnt realise, excellent :D
retrogametech How difficult is it to install a backlight in a GBA SP? I have bits of fluff in the screen and need to take it apart anyway
retrogametech If you like GB.GBC,GBA games i reccomend you Gamerascal.co.uk, they have really great games and reasonable prices (for the most part). P.S. Sorry for my bad english
retrogametech Enjoying Mass Effect series eh? I just finished a 13 run of the games today, female Shepard this time. I had traded in my 360 against the Halo 4 360 pack, I got 20 GAME credit back for buying the console. So got 2X 1200points and along with some spare points bought the ME2 Overlord DLC, and the ME3 DLCs Leviathan  Omega. I have all the main DLCs apart from ME1Pinnacle Station, read it was bit meh Great series, its worth doing all the side quests and reading all the codex entries etc.
retrogametech Brilliant games! GBA library just keeps amazing me with such quality hidden gems!
retrogametech i dont really hate you :P
retrogametech Hey...nice pick up video.like them gba games.peace an more money..
retrogametech Hi, Im from the UK and am after one of those 10mhz oscillator crystals for my model 1 MegaDrive. where do you get yours and have you got a part number or anything? Any help would be appreciated.
retrogametech Love the idea of removing the RF out and adding the extra 3.5mm jack, much better than having a wire sticking out at the front.
retrogametech hey yeah that would be awsome :P
retrogametech I love those rocker switches. Would the ones with the led status look better for the over lock one? :)
retrogametech I still have my original SNES, but its finicky, and I could make it work like new, but I already replaced the cartridge slot in a better looking, minimally yellowed SNES I bought at a thrift store, so Im just holding onto my SNES for nostalgias sake, I suppose.
retrogametech That is a good idea to use stereo at the back, i actually broke my headphone jack when i was hoovering around and i hit the audio cable at the front, i had to solder a new 3.5mm jack in place. I have a bunch of toggle switches but those kind look a lot neater, how did you cut out the slot for the switches as with the toggles ones its just a simple drill through and use the nut to secure it. I have a game Zero Tolerance that you can use the EXT port to hook up 2 Megadrives for multiplayer.
retrogametech How come you dont just use the LR audio outputs from the MegaCD? figured those cables were just for people running 32X without the CD
retrogametech They might but Ive never seen any small enough that have that feature.
retrogametech If I was to mod a console, Id mod one that is in bad condition (gouges, scrapes, dents, etc..). I wouldnt like to ruin a nice one. My yellowed SNES with a cracked shell would be fine for modding.
retrogametech I appreciate the feedback but my videos are, for the most part, unscripted low production on the fly vlogs about my hobbies and interests. What you see is what you get and this is how I am in real life. If youre looking for high production content with a paid presenter wholl clearly enunciate every word, you might want to look somewhere else.
retrogametech Excellent update! Cant wait to see more updates as the project progresses.
retrogametech Thanks. I hope it all comes together nicely :)
retrogametech I really like the size of that version MVS board man. Very interested to see how the controller ports and final product looks. Cool stuff man :)
retrogametech thanks for the mention man:) looks like its coming together nicely. Cant wait to see how it turns out. nice work on the sketches too they look awesome!
retrogametech Ah, yeah, that makes sense.
retrogametech haha nice pirate cart there, 161 in 1, lol.
retrogametech HDMI is common and standard for all modern digital devices nowadays. Scart is what was common and standard for older devices before HDMI that output an analogue signal. Scart can carry different types of video and audio signal and is extremely versatile.
retrogametech Thanks dude. Haha, I noticed you had one of these same carts sitting in your cab in a recent video. Theyre awesome! But some of those ROM hacks are pretty explicit! ( . Y . ) lol. Yeah, going to keep it simple and clean. No point in extra outputs when its custom built for my personal needs :) .
retrogametech Gigabyte Disc. It has a small inner section that is like a normal CD (Where the audio cd warning tracks and sometimes bonus art materials hide), surrounded by a larger, higher density section where the games are. All those people that ripped their Dreamcast discs to ISOs? They had to use a Dreamcast itself to do that, over network or serial port, nothing else will read the entire disc.
retrogametech Taking apart the dreamcast?
retrogametech Its a plastic piece of plastic!!!!!! yayyy!!!!!
retrogametech It is really important to keep your screws organized, even moreso for the Dreamcast. Its easy to say, mount the GDROM with a screw that appears to be the same size, but is really a millimeter or two longer. It will bore down into the pcb where theres a densely packed area of traces going into the GPU and just cut through a bunch of them. I remember seeing a few people do this years ago, and the gore photos were displeasant to say the least.
retrogametech sweat band for added suspense
retrogametech i can tell that is a version 0 too because of the heat pipes. i have a 0 and a 1. i dont know how you use ice trey like that. seems harder to know where each ones goes like that.
retrogametech smash shift for a few seconds to turn off sticky keys that shit is fucking annoying to read on youtube
retrogametech Bad Habit, I Can Never Remember Which Words I Should Be Capitalizing, So I Just Capitalize Them All.
retrogametech According to the stats at current You could be making from 6,100  15,100 US per year. but keep it mind it fluctuates. Go for it !
retrogametech Haha, I find it difficult not to laugh everytime I hear it :P
retrogametech Ever Think Of Trying To Integrate The Wireless Receiver Like You Did With Your Xbox? In My Opinion It Would Certainly Look Nicer.
retrogametech Thanks for the nice comment! XD
retrogametech Thanks, thats cool to know :)
retrogametech you should monetize your vids. even a few extra quid here and there could beef up your collection. well as long as gits like me arent using adblock
retrogametech congrats on the 10k subs! keep it up your videos are the best!!
retrogametech Shadow Dancer was released in the US. I have a Sega Classics copy of it.
retrogametech love the space harrier music in this version!! my fav version of the game by far!! subscriber aswell, got that game myself
retrogametech Im going to try this after I clean the connectors on the game cartridges. They, and the pins on the consoles are corroded, so I hope thats the only thing I have to do. Ive got 2 different DSs to work on. Fun, Fun!
retrogametech The cutting board? You can pick those up in most 1 shops. I cant remember the exact name, other than cutting board :P
retrogametech Great video thanks for takeing time out to do this for everyone :)
retrogametech game is broken, or spark or worst, a big kaboom
retrogametech Thank you, Ill try to make more of these.
retrogametech Best video yet. Awesome job mate.
retrogametech at 15:05 it sounds like your pulling a sword out lol
retrogametech Thanks. Yeah it started out as and still is just a hobby :) .
retrogametech Yeah its a shame that the older games are impossible to find or expensive, and then our game stores are often littered with shovelware, well it is in Perth at least. And good luck with the collection, its always good to see other people with nice collections out there.
retrogametech Playstation 3 BluRay playback isnt region free. My BluRay player is.
retrogametech Do you have time to play those things? Other question i have is do you fix those and sell for profit?
retrogametech I would love to have all of my 20 systems hooked up at once like you guys but unless I can come up with a good way of making it clutter free looking I dont think its going to happen.... My wife would most certainly throw a shit fit.
retrogametech Lets be honest here: Your Neo Geo MVS Cabs own all these Consols. Everyone can have those but not the Cabs which are truly amazing.
retrogametech Great setup Luke  kind of makes me regret selling my AES and DuoR now... lol
retrogametech I just bought a Japanese Sega Saturn and i wonder if i can play Pal games on it with the Action Replay 4M cartridge
retrogametech NES??? SNES?? GameGear? Loool
retrogametech I just added a response video to show my current setup (WIP). :)
retrogametech We have the same TV cabinet thing :D
retrogametech Thanks dude! No updated tour with your new consoles?
retrogametech Besides I might loose power, I only have a SNES now, on the floor, and a CMVS, also on the floor in a box. I show both individually anyway. I dont want to do that again until I fix this mess, that is unless in the next few days a car doesnt fly through the roof destroying anything. But its on my todo list )
retrogametech Looks awesome man. I love my CDX.
retrogametech you totally need a turbografxpc engine! thatd be the one extra console to get
retrogametech id love to upload mine, but its all boxed up and in 3 different houses. all i currently have hooked up is my 360 :(
retrogametech Common as in you can walk into any electronic store and find a set This way you wont have to order them online.
retrogametech The point of it is is to be able to use universal cables (RCAComponentSvideo etc...), I know there are component ports and things like that out there but universal cords are more common, From what I can tell you can use pretty much any connector on it if you know what points to solder it was a bit hard for me to tell with the diagram. I could send you some photos of people that have done it, thought I included them in.
retrogametech I believe in emulating games but it is illeagal to rip a game from its hardware and uploading it to the internet.
retrogametech You dont have to add all of them you could just take some RCA jacks and solder them on from what I know. It would be a hard project. I had an idea of adding a audio 3.5mm jack but not sure if it was possible. Its kinda of like the Sega AV mod you did. I think it was the 16 bit?
retrogametech uhh prety sure officil ones have the bump they even have wifi too i doubt you could download the kernal if it was fake
retrogametech I bought an original NDS from Gamestation when they first came out and it came with a flash cart that used micro USB. I think that was the first cart ever
retrogametech i got the same wifi r4 ,that works for you :)) bought it for 18 before this website got shut down
retrogametech retrogametech Where did you pick up these r4s from? Cant seem to find em anywhere :(
retrogametech i would love to get that game!
retrogametech Forget it now, its really an horrible pirate game.
retrogametech Can you play Game Boy games on the GBA?
retrogametech Rememver these from china
retrogametech YOU. HAVE. BEEN. WARNED.
retrogametech I have the exact same cartridge. :) watch?vubX0a8Ngct3m40s
retrogametech You are right... the music is indeed horrible
retrogametech Sure, just look at Final Fantasy! I made the joke a long time ago, I think they are going to keep it limping on long enough to get into the 70s with it...
retrogametech I actually checked that out after you posted this comment and you totally right!! lol The Game Com version is way worse than this! AND its an officially licensed Sega game!! That crazy!
retrogametech its called mega drive in japan.
retrogametech Hey man can u help me I have a ds lite that doesnt work, the probelms is that when I turn it on the power light is on (green) but theres no sound or picture.
retrogametech Just messing around with and modding old consoles over the years. You pick up and learn as you go. None of what I do is overly complicated or difficult :) . Most of the time things just need a full strip down and clean.
retrogametech I hope this isnt some sort of dodgy euphemism! Either way, have fun! :P
retrogametech You can get them on eBay really cheap for about 34. But I really dont recommend composite for the Dreamcast at all! Youll be missing out on so much of the Dreamcasts awesome, vibrant arcade style visuals. Invest in either a proper RGB Scart or if you really want to see what the Dreamcast can do then get a VGA box! :) . Both are well worth the extra money.
retrogametech do they have the ags101 SPs in your area?
retrogametech I would have liked to have seen you perform the fuse repair on the DS. That would have been interesting.
retrogametech I dread to think what that stain is on the back of the 3DS...
retrogametech Is the GBA SP NES version still availible?
retrogametech Im sure, the AVGN would love to own one of these multi adapters.
retrogametech Me too! Is it worth it to mod the og box though
retrogametech Every time I get a retro system I completely dismantle it then wash it in the sink with hot soapy water and a toothbrush. Let it fully dry then wipe it using a microfibre cloth sprayed with a small amount of WD40. Makes old systems look like new! I did a howto vid a while back. Should be on my channel somewhere :)
retrogametech Great mod Martin! What about the MVS? Do you have any news on this project? Im really looking forward to see it working again!
retrogametech Do you connect the cables in series or just all together? also if i get a 9v 2a can i just run 2 units off of that instead of getting the 9v 4a to run 4 ?
retrogametech Haha, thanks dude. Those oversized power adapters have always bugged me and Ive been after a way to get rid of them for a while! Im sure people have done this before although I dont think anyone has ever released a commercial product. Is that the cable that gives you stereo sound over RGB scart with both mk1s? Ive got me one of those too! Awesome!
retrogametech I see that remote on your TV Stand. Is that for the SumiVision Cyclone 2 ? If so, High bloody 5!
retrogametech Just noticed that you have a Genesis CDX, would like to know if this console have any problems like loading problems, and the overall lifespam of the console is the same than using a mega drive and a sega cd?
retrogametech Very nice although definitely reserved for people that know what they are doing. Would be nothing worse than plugging it in and just seeing a puff of smoke from them all
retrogametech I would love a tutorial on how to make one of these
retrogametech Thanks, I still need to decide on a nice compact PSU to use with it. Any suggestions?
retrogametech Wow, that is a small MVS :) I really like how small it is, should be great for the console. Nice you finally got the UniBios. Looking foward to the progress. Btw, what materials are you thinking about using for the housingshell?
retrogametech awesome stuff! cant wait to see it consolized!
retrogametech So when youre done consolizing the MVS are you going to keep it? If so, where are you going to put it? Your setup has no room. Well, unless you take out the CDX.
retrogametech hey mate do you sell these consolised? i seen a few on ebay, but cant seem to find them again
retrogametech Itll probably be too bulky to sit on the entertainment unit so I plan to design it in a way where it wont look out of place sitting on its own, freestanding on the the floor. Even though the MV1B is tiny in comparison to the other boards its still very big compared to a regular console. The CDXMultiMega is not hooked up. Its just for show since its way too cool to keep in storage P
retrogametech Why do the rings make the sound of the cursor moving in a menu in the old pokemon!?
retrogametech Hey I sent you a PM the other day, did you get it? I needed you advice on something I bought.
retrogametech Another great video mate. Fantastic quality aswell. Its quite remarkable how clear you can capture the image on the GBA. Normally you see a lot of glare. Looking forward to the next vid
retrogametech That is absolutely amazing! Where did you get it?
retrogametech When you get a ring,the pokemon selection sound could heard
retrogametech I would totally pick that game up
retrogametech The sound that plays when you collect a ring is from Pokemon :I why ripoff Pokemon?
retrogametech So did Sonic! xD Looked like he was jamming to the beat with his idle animation in this one.
retrogametech Thanks, dude! Like others have mentioned its a backlit GBA Im using. It makes it a little easier but Ive found even with those, filming the screen without glare can be tricky. So Ive now rigged up a special system for filming shiny LCD screens :) . Its very basic but seems to do the job. Might do a short vid on it in future :)
retrogametech thats the 6v micro controller, i think the best bet is to leave it as it is, those little feckers are a pain in the balls to take off and replace, all this does is acts as a relay switch which has a on and off controller, just like 12 relays in a car, it senses the voltage and turns on or off according to power, bridging it would probably just shorten the life of the unit by a non substantial amount due to being on all the time, ive had all the tritons but the new pro plus are really good :)
retrogametech I know this sounds cheesy but I figured Id chime in anyway. You might be able to do some sort of contest, I dont know what it would be exactly but considering you didnt spend a boat load of money on the headset it might be an interesting way of getting more subscribers(if you care about that sort of thing). Again I would understand if you didnt want to stoop to that level of promotion just figured Id share my thoughts. Keep on being awesome as usual :D
retrogametech Your best bet is ebay, or if youre in the US you can also find things on Freecycle and Craigslist. Garage and yard sales are also common places to find these things cheap. When on ebay, you can search for broken or for partsrepair in the descriptions to narrow the field. Its a little time consuming, but you can find great deals.
retrogametech He does have a point though. Why would you write like that? It takes longer and just looks odd.
retrogametech I Was Kinda Annoyed About The Wireless On Mine At First Because My Old Headphones Had Volume Adjusters. But When I Have A 360 Controller Play And Charge Kit, Possibly 360 Headphones, Samsung Galaxy Tab Charger All Around Me, I Dont Miss Having An Extra Cord.
retrogametech The seller said the game was fine and I have no real reason to doubt him. Ideally Id have another system to test it on but I suppose I just have to take his word. It does look in very good condition and it partially loaded that one time so I dont think its the issue. The garbled BIOS text on screen is my main concern for now.
retrogametech Im in the same boat, got video issues with a PC Motherboard, but as you said signs of life and thats enough for me to keep troubleshooting...
retrogametech how do you avoid getting electricuted ? i know you have to unplug stuff but i heard that devices hide some electricity
retrogametech You maybe right. Maybe it is caused by one of the lines that was soldered, one of them might be unnescessary and might have been left unused for a reason, so you have to break each one of the lines you made and test the system each time.
retrogametech Oh and the date is 3775 SUN. So your battery is completely flat . That date being that far off might lock the cart up also.
retrogametech Very nice tip! Thanks for sharing Im going to try this out for sure.
retrogametech Just stick a rechargeable lithium with a series resistor going to the  on the card to keep it topped up in use. Easier than reopening it constantly!
retrogametech i have a pokemon gold that needs battery changing... TO EBAY I GO!
retrogametech Great tip. Thank you for sharing.
retrogametech Hey RetroGameTech! Love your videos. I hate to annoy you, but I was inspired by this video to do this mod to my Gameboy Pokmon Gold cart, I also did an indepth tutorial on how to do this mod. I would be honored for you to check it out: watch?vCKU6hDHgnNQ
retrogametech Might not, because the top plastic is different  it goes down, while the GBC plastic goes up.
retrogametech When the battery dies you lose you lose your save data. Well when you switch the battery, will you lose it again?
retrogametech Careful, not all batteries are 3V. Some are 1.5V.
retrogametech For your xbox with the blue LED how did you get a clear xbox logo cap (the middle thing on the top with a blue light)? Please reply
retrogametech You think the LCD is expensive?That is a 20x4 HD44780 screen you can pick up a basic one for 2, or the BlueWhite for 46.
retrogametech Are you selling this unit?  Ill happily pay for this!
retrogametech DaveSimonH Have you PS3 re pasted with new Thermal paste and your good for another 23 yrs depend on useage.. Happy gaming
retrogametech or actually just has to be connected to internet maybe idk?
retrogametech I just wish it would die altogether, I would have just bought a slim but it clinging to life makes me want to keep going with it. It can be pretty ridiculous though the amount of YLOD I have to go through to get it running, the record is 12 attempts, yes twelve..... lol It gave me a reason to pick up a standalone bluray player though, got a Toshiba BDX3200 which when you install the Aussie firmware (USB or CD) makes it region free for DVDs  blurays. Can now get region A locked US blurays :)
retrogametech nice pick up dude...yeah the sticky dvd rom dive can be easley over come bye a tapping the top of the console up the just ubove the rom drive b because there was no dvd lock keys for the xbox ones you can just drop in anothere new drive that works
retrogametech Martin, for your sticky dvd drive. Sometimes they arent sticky, but just dont close properly, thus wont open again until closed properly. So just try using the close tray in unleashx, you should hear the drive close, from then onwards it should openclose until switched off again.... Beats the thumbing!
retrogametech Modding XBoxes. Its so fun soldering wire to vias while trying to make sense of crap quality photos that may or may not relate to either your XBox or the modchip you bought. I used XBMC on mine for about 3 years and it was great. Now I run XBMC on a jailbroken Apple TV 2 and its equally great  but can decode H.264 video.
retrogametech Ive been subscribed to both of Jeris channels for a while now :) . She properly knows her stuff! I watch her vids and try to followunderstand but a lot of what she does is WAY beyond my level of understanding. I clearly have a lot to learn, haha :P. Its still always really interesting to follow her projects.
retrogametech i cant believe i watched the whole thing.. lol pretty interestin this was.. guys who actually try and bring retro stuff back to life are absolute legends, a service to the history of gaming.. its definitely somethin i wanna get into, have to knick me dads solderer and get crackin on that dead jap MD of mine. :)
retrogametech I have no idea what youre talking about but I still watch your videos ).
retrogametech I think, if you both dont already know of her, you would both gain a lot of info about electronics and games computers like amigas etc if you were to look at the videos made by (and made about) the very popular youtuber Jeri Ellsworth watch?veFzsyQOTXbM watch?vcLy0mVkoLio
retrogametech Is the PSU giving enough power to the entire board? I repair old MSDOS computers and sometimes the seller added a card to the motherboard and it exceeded the power supply.
retrogametech Does it have to Port on the back of it for the MegaDrive MODEM?
retrogametech your channel is amazing!
retrogametech Is that a fire extinguisher in your room? Lol
retrogametech lol that is awesome, Id love to have a mini Dreamcast for my collection
retrogametech Just check a lot and frequently :P
retrogametech Risky Ride is my fave Outrun song!
retrogametech I can feel the SEGA love.
retrogametech I bet if you took todays best hardware tech, you could probably make real working consoles that size! lol
retrogametech awesome...love how it all fits together, wow, that cartirdge is cool as hell, so detailed
retrogametech What do the prices go for on those 40 in 1 carts
retrogametech Looking good! Nearly bought a neo geo console myself the other week, this may ignite more interest lol
retrogametech Thanks! fingers crossed I can revive it :)
retrogametech Awesome video as always!!! Cool project you got on your hands. These types of video are the best!!! Thanks!!!
retrogametech Great vid man, looking forward to seeing it in action which Im sure you will, you sound determined lol. Its cool that you have fans willing enough to help you that are in the know with these types of things also cool that you gave the guy credit i bet he feels awesome right about now!. I am in need of some help I feel you might be the one to go to....you up for it?
retrogametech Well, the Famicom and SMS glasses work on eachother, so it should work. The reason I just said Almost definately is because I havent actually tried it myself.
retrogametech See, I thought I remembered you mentioning this, haha. Thanks for the idea! :)
retrogametech Nicely done! Yeah, the official glasses can be really expensive! Its interesting that the Japanese Master Systems dont need that 3D adapter unit. I want to get one, partly because you can play Sega SG1000 games on it, and thats a REALLY expensive retro console!
retrogametech Thought I got away with it )
retrogametech Ive got three pairs of the glasses, my main issue is theyre made for kids, so youll need to have a small head or the arms that are brittle as all hell will easily snap off. But do these glasses have a model name at all? They should also work on famicom 3D games.
retrogametech neat videos. does it get hot or stinky?
retrogametech What a lovely oversized night light!
retrogametech Fantastic job Martin ! Looks awesome. I love how it illuminates that playstation insert, The flash from Dukes guns looks amazing ! Top stuff dude :)
retrogametech Lol, I had to take the front screen off again! hahaha. Wont be doing that again :P
retrogametech Or people will argue that the store like gamespot will lose money, even though they pretty much screw the developers and customers when it comes to selling used games, and trading in games lol.
retrogametech You have the coolest shit Man...Bravo on a great new tech I had no idea that it existed!thanks Bro. :)
retrogametech How did you get one of these? I heard that its illegal to buy, sell, or advertise them in the UK and Ireland.
retrogametech is the super card gba good?
retrogametech I buyed one one year ago.Very nice...
retrogametech does that software work on mac os x? Or only windows eh?
retrogametech N0 I am sorry my fellow mac user ,but you will have to set up boot camp or run it threw wine.
retrogametech He shows in the video that it does!!
GameSack Only people id wanna see is you guys. Wish Happy Console Gamer was gonna be there. Granted I live in texas so ill probably go.
GameSack Dang live nowhere near there.....
GameSack If money wasnt an issue, Id love to see you guys at Classic Gaming Expo. Its the week prior in Vegas.
GameSack Shirt is trippin me out
GameSack I wish I could go that sounds pretty cool to meet you guys. Too bad Im on the east coast :(
GameSack Seriously, you guys a just middleaged men who are over obsessed with video games......hell ya I subscribed!
GameSack Bring your own sacks.
GameSack I didnt know the Neo Geo CD was developed as a costeffective alternative to the original Neo Geo system. I always just figured it was a response to the illconceived CD system boom of the early 90s, but I guess a costreduced version makes more sense for the Neo Geo.
GameSack Crossed Swords always made me think about the Phantasy Star game battles, imagining both of those mixed together would be damn amazing 00
GameSack That was one hell of an episode! I own a Japanese Neo Geo CD but always wanted to get a CDZ. I hear that the system heats up quickly though and may lead to some hardware failure. Did you encounter such a thing while recording the footage for this awesome episode?
GameSack Had a Neo Geo CD that I had to sell on ebay before college, broke my heart. My collection consisted of Real Bout Fatal Fury 1,2 and special, KOFs 9498, and Samurai Showdowns 14. The load times are so long you become immune to load times in general... sigh, I dont know if Ill ever love again.
GameSack Wow, wow... No Art Of Fighting?! There are some of the 3 best games in the system, plus the third one has animations in the level od Street Fighter 3...! I missed the King of Fighters series and also some nice sports games, like Super Sidekicks, Windjammers and that golf game, Neo Turf Masters, but you guys already covered this one.Nice vdeo, I love the Neo Geo CD, the games are very collectible, nice artworks in the manuals and cds. Treasures!
GameSack sweet Golden Axe shirt Dave!
GameSack Nice episode. To restart a game hold down all four buttons and startselect, it will take you back to the CD Audio menu.
GameSack Wow, their acting actually improved. I remember playing Samurai Spirits 2 at a supermarket while my parents were shopping. And also when the store simply pulled it away because of the increasing number of children going there only to play for free.
GameSack I love Samurai Shodown 4. I used to play it so much in the arcade. The first time when I beat it I felt like I was gonna crap myself because it was the first game I ever beat, also I was about 7 and I used an exploit on the last boss to beat him.. yea I wasnt really that good. :P
GameSack dude...the guy on the left is like a weird hybrid of ron perlman and jim gaffigan loloh you...you irishbad ass video nonetheless, dat golden axe shirt!
GameSack Amazing episode ! You guys are the best ! Keep doing the amazing work! I almost bought the 1x cd read version back in 1995 here in Brazil, but I ended buying the Sega Saturn and didnt regret, as the Sega console also had lots of SNKs classics. And the loading times on the 1x cd rom version are really really annoying...
GameSack Cant say I would ever buy one, but very cool nonetheless.
GameSack Greetings from Boulder. Your stopmotion hardware teardowns are the best.
GameSack KOF for another episode? SCHWEET! Its sad that its the only ongoing SNK series, though....
GameSack Pahahahaha Paul mate this video is class. Best one uve edited in ages. Enjoyed being a part of the making it and being the evil old witch...but yeah class clips there. Oh and I realise my phone mic sucks so badly...Cldnt stop laughing the whole way through, keep em coming.
GameSack VERY TENNISY HUH? hahah another great episode.
GameSack if you guys plan on doing another left in japan, may i suggest seiken densetsu 3 on the SNES, the sequel to secret of mana? it improves pretty much everything (in my opinion anyway), from game play, character development, and the story is much grander. the only things that hinder it are a lack of customisation, because each character can only equip 1 type of weapon, and there are a couple of glitches that make certain items useless (im looking at you shields), and critical hits are nowhere to be seen. but still, if you liked secret of mana, you will almost surely like (or prefer if your really into it) Seiken Densetsu 3.
GameSack you guys should dedicate an episode to cave shooters :) lots of great region free japanese imports on the xbox 360 :) cave shooters are the best :) also 5pb made a really good region free shooter called bullet soul :)
GameSack Awesome as usual. Thanks guys.
GameSack Tobal No. 2 on the Play Station X or one. its a really good Fighter and there is a Eng Patch for this game.
GameSack That macross game was rereleased for the ps3 and came bundled with the bluray version of the same movie it was based on.
GameSack To answer your question on Xanadu II, yes, an English patch is in the works, and yes, the cutscenes are being translated to. Im actually one of the voice actors in the project. Sadly, I think the project hit a brick wall a few years ago, and I havent heard from the project head since then. :
GameSack The song that plays over the credits, is that from Granada? Where can I find that arrangement? Thanks!
GameSack have you played bara yarou gourmet sentai on the famicom? the graphics are excellent and its a funny surreal cyber punk japan as fuck take on the side scrolling beat em up.you get to make a recipe with all the strange food you tend to find usually for energy in that style of game at the end of each level hehe.
GameSack Who preorderd the beta!
GameSack Good vid as always coop
GameSack Anyone got a base gold jay ratliff DT for the cowboys on xbox 360? Could someone please trade me him. Really need him for a collection but hes nowhere to be seen :( if your willing to trade message me on xbox gt : A7X Predatorz. Thanks
GameSack I wonder how their wives reacted when they were making this.
GameSack So this is why ya havent made a video in a while? Need ideas or something? smh
GameSack Wow, this came out really good. I bet a lot of time and effort went in to playstation and SNES having sex! But its kinda awkward seeing that 64 watch
GameSack what did I just watch?
GameSack damn Joe, I mean I know your the man but that was some excellent stop motion.
GameSack Well this was.....interesting?
GameSack lol console pornography
GameSack PlayStation vs Super Nintendo !
GameSack so youhave other two other chanells and you choose to like your videos to get more views your so dumb be a independent youtuber for once
GameSack abes odyssey is one of my favorite games of ALL FUCKING TIME MOTHERFUCKER.this game blew my mind and still does... cant wait for the remake!
GameSack 2:07 hhahah I did notice that if I keep my playstation like that or standing up like new consoles it worked better, I didnt have any idea why it just worked, but now I know it was over heating.
GameSack I gladly retired my Original PS console upon buying my PS2 Fat console model.Besides playing these games today without the PS2 Texture Smoothing feature turned on is a nono in my book.
GameSack Harry and the original cheryl ftw
GameSack you can make the screen follow spyro you know its a setting in the game all three for the playstation have that
GameSack You should both kill your self and try get a life
GameSack you guys should review the original Xbox
GameSack y u no mention Metal Gear Solid?
GameSack How would you know to turn you Playstation upside down with out internet?
GameSack Wenn ich diese verkakte jim fotzenkopf werbung noch einmal sehen muss raste ich aus...skfkjwbefinejfbvwulvbhijbiw .
GameSack At least each of these Sonic wannabes seemed different as opposed to now where every new game character is the same scruffy, unshaven white guy wandering through some ruined city. Who was the last new original platforming star who had a colorful world? Sackboy?
GameSack a friend sold me a Croc for GBC back in the day, but I dont remember which one, it was decent.
GameSack I played Vectorman on Sonics Ultimate Genesis Collection on PS3.
GameSack I actually played punky skunk. It wasnt bad for its time, though those roller skate missions can go to hell.
GameSack snatcher Tshirt.....!? awesome.
GameSack Can anyone tell me what game the song came from during the credits. The fact that I cant pinpoint it is eating me up. And I dont think its from the list in the credits
GameSack sonic isnt in any way shape or form a failed mascot...
GameSack Another that springs to mind is Plok on the SNES... from what I remember it was a nice enough game, but I never felt any love for it whatsoever. Maybe it was the beeswasps... I cant handle those in games :(
GameSack Ha ha this is AWESOME!!!
GameSack I never understood how people generally prefer Revenge of Shinobi to Shinobi III, I just dont.
GameSack Great vlog, I like the content. 16bit is my fav era and fully agree that SCIV is number one! Love that game!
GameSack I wish I was equipped with blast processing :(
GameSack I feel all those games are worthy of awards and being up on those top 10 lists. Like Castlevania IV. Can play that even to this day and still not get bored with it.
GameSack Congrats on 100 episodes!!! I think Gaiares looks more like a Thunder Force II upgrade,and also why wasnt any of the Sonic games on the list?
GameSack Cool list. Ive never heard of that shooter game, but Ill have to give it a try. I would have added Demons Crest and Actraiser 2 to the list.I really enjoyed Castlevania 4, but... I found the final battle a bit disappointing  Dracula doesnt turn into a demon! As I recall, his face just changes a bit or something.
GameSack Had a good laugh. Nice top ten and congrats on your 100th episode.
GameSack Your list is different than mine ... therefore I hate you dumb dummies.
GameSack Congrats on 100... Ill be waiting for 200 :)
GameSack If your not gonna do video game reviews, just review the franchise.
GameSack Gundam Wing: Endless Duel is one of the best fighting games for that era IMO. Such a shame they didnt bother releasing it here.Good fighting system, graphics, music, and awesome super moves.
GameSack Snk fighters are way better than capcom fighters. And the neo get was a 16th it console as well so why no fighters from them? Oh wait now I get if you included them in this video the video would have been named neogeo fighting games because they would have taken the spot from these shitty fighting games you showed.
GameSack jajaja about the Dragon ball z game, if you see the anime you will understand whast going on there... anyway.... good video boys!! :)
GameSack havent watch ranma 12 and havent watch dragon ball z??
GameSack Shaq Fu, Power Rangers, Fatal Fury, and Final Fight are pretty glaring omissions for better or worse.
GameSack Fatal fury and world heroes
GameSack I remember back in the day I would try to play every single fighting game that came out because I thought they were ALL awesome...but after watching this video I see that most of the fighting games that werent made by capcom or snk were garbage. I was so jealous of eternal champions since I didnt have a sega. Not so much now....
GameSack I remmember eternal champions dat game is f king hard I couldnt beat my 1st opponet also yu yu hakusho final is a good fighting game for snes itz only in jap tho
GameSack non SF2MK 16 bit games you didnt mention,Godzilla destroy all monsters: you mightve heard of Godzilla destroy all monsters melee, Godzilla unleashed, and Godzilla save the earth on the original Xbox and ps2 but Godzilla destroy all monsters on the super famicom is the Godzilla game we deserved as kids! Its one you should check this one out, its really good, and its a lot better that those cruddy GodzillaGodzilla 2 super Godzilla games by Toho (btw i like toho as a movie company but not a video game company) But its ok that you didnt show it because its very obscure and was only released in japan. Its something that you should add to your licensed fighting game collection. (now thinking of it, licensed fighting games are pretty good. TMNT tournament fighters (SNES version), dragon ball z butoden 2, and Godzilla 2v2 fighting games (destroy all monsters, destroy all monster melee, Godzilla unleashed, Godzilla save the earth)
GameSack battletoads for the arcades uses the same sound chip found in most pinball machines of the time.
GameSack Thanks for the video, really enjoyed seeing DJ Boy again!
GameSack Ive got some more arcade titles for you guys to try. Theyre all beatemups except for the first one(because I love that genre).The 2 Atomic Punk(Bomberman) games. Im pretty sure they were never ported to any console.Mug Smashers. I wouldnt say its great, but its pretty decent. Its kind of humorous too.Crime Fighters. It plays a bit slow when your beating up on people, but is a pretty good game.Mutation Nation. This one is very good, although Im not sure what all the letters do that you can pick up. Im also not sure what buttons 3 and 4 do.The Legend of Silkroad. Not sure if youd want to include this. It depends on what you guys think if it. I think its an okay game, but definitely not that great. In my opinion, its not a big loss that it never got ported.Knuckle Bash is a neat and very strange little beatemup.Ninja Clowns. In my opinion this game is pretty terrible. The only reason Im listing it is that everyone has different tastes and opinions, so its possible one of you guys might actually like it.Legionnaire. This one doesnt work on my version of MAME, so I have no idea if its good of not, but it looked like it might be.Dungeon Magic. This is an excellent game! It even has RPG elements and an isometric view that Im sure Dave will love, lol.
GameSack guy you should look up blue journey it pretty fun and for the neo geo
GameSack Cant wait for the new episode today! Game Sack is favorite show online or on TV. You guys rock. Let me get a wazzzzuuuupppppp from Dave!
GameSack Any thoughts on The First Funky Fighter?
GameSack I wouldve love to hear your thoughts on Metamorphic Force
GameSack I really enjoy Game Sack. I appreciate to what both of you do. Did you play The Punisher (arcade game) or battel circuit? I really like both of them.
GameSack Hippodrome, Red Earth, WWF WrestleFest, Warrior Blade: Rastan Saga Episode III, XMen, Best Bout Boxing and Metamoqester,
GameSack I love me some Game Sack I surely do.
GameSack Wheres for immortal sisters
GameSack Ill do the series thing, but is it alright if Raps and I are on a team? Hes q YouTuber, Im a semi competitive player, we hell each other out, we get burgers, he comes back to my place, we get it on for the rest of the night with H4
GameSack I wish that they would add multiple husky raid maps because I dislike this one.HATE IT
GameSack The background music is excellent.
GameSack Wanna see you guys do a episode on Tandy
GameSack This is the Best documentary Ive seen in like forever. I love it
GameSack Why thunder force 2 on the X68000 looks the same as on the genesis is because they both use the Motorola 68000 Video chip
GameSack You guy should do Amiga.
GameSack great episode guys. i always look foreword to what you will review next. i wish that you included the Fatal Fury games from this episode so i can compare them with the NeoGeo ones. that reminds me, when will you do an exclusive NeoGeo episode? you should think about doing something similar to that and review every system out there. it would make one hell of an episode. keep up the good work guys. and thanks for making YouTube more awesome.
GameSack The mecha in Mad Stalker totally looks like a Kampfer from Gundam: 0080.
GameSack Is You need some practice more or less annoying than Where did you learn to fly?. That Star Wars game looks awesome though.
GameSack No over 9000 joke? Okay.BTW episode 100 is coming do you have any plans or something like that.
GameSack So many shoot em ups!I wish gamers in the West loved shmups as much as the Japanese do.
GameSack Propeller Arena for the Dreamcast is very good.
GameSack I love your guys videos. Nice, clean and simple. No need for overthetop graphics, screaming, yelling or unneeded profanity. I love getting right down to the games and giving the info I want. Keep up the good work.
GameSack If I remember correctly, Major Damage was supposed to be a Contra parody, wasnt it?
GameSack Everyone who disliked this, be different!
GameSack Changing Market Conditions. Wait... What?! I smell bull.
GameSack RESQ was released in Amiga computers, and Fido Dido in Mega Drive (at least in Europe).By the way Mega Drive sound was not bad compared to SNES, the problem was the innability of the western composers to make good music for Mega Drive, you only have to play Sonic 3, Shinobi , or SOR 2 to shit bricks.
GameSack was fiddo dido not on sega channel once? I sware I played that pile of crud before
GameSack would love to see the Sonic SATAM game
GameSack does anyone know where I can find that version of Gradius 3 in the wind that plays in the background during the first section of the episode?
GameSack Fucking hashtags on youtube? Seriously?
GameSack Remember To Like!!! :3
GameSack U guys suck or I play gta too much. I think its both
GameSack omg i just realized that joven was on king of the nerds i love that show i wish joven won though.
GameSack Love all videos of grand theft auto 5
GameSack Does anyone notice than theyre in the same room
GameSack did you steal dbzwii09s tbag
GameSack sohinki should of been on franklins body and lasercorn should been on trevors body because of his face he made
GameSack I LIKE SMOSH GAMES WEN THEY PLAY GTA5
GameSack Third the nerd second the best first the worst
GameSack I want gta sooo bad...its still so freakin expensive!
GameSack Yo GameSack I would really love for you to answer this question because i may purcahse a retrogen for the snes. Does it capture that good genesis sound when you use it or no?
GameSack The pastel color scheme makes it seem cheap.
GameSack As far as I know the reason the GBA and Genesis adapters have their own AV outs is that all the actual guts is in the adapter. It doesnt use any of the SNES hardware to output the video. It merely draws power from it. I agree its clunky but probably the easiest way of doing emulation on a SNES, especially when you consider the SNES is 16bit and the GBA is 32bit.
GameSack I dont get it. Its emulation anyway so why not just use an android device...?
GameSack But does it run super mario rpg?
GameSack i will recommend the Supa Boy fro Hyperkin. it is almost the same.
GameSack Hi Guys! I have enjoyed watching your show, and I love video game. I have played a lot of games and I have now a PlayStation 2 and I think that I would switch to a Sega Saturn console or a Super Nintendo Entertainment System console. I take this opportunity to wish you a happy New year 2014, and see you in the next year.
GameSack Very very good thorough review unlike ALPHAOMEGASIN Sorry Bro.
GameSack Holding the balls of God LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!
GameSack Of all the game sacks in the world, youre the game sackiest.Not sure if you guys have mentioned it before, but have you ever played Sweet Home on the Famicom? Its totally awesome. I only ask because theres a repro cart available now.
GameSack Star Ocean: First Departure is far superior to the Super Famicom version. Its improved in every way.
GameSack 48 mega power? as in the star ocean cartridge has 48mb?
GameSack Really not mentioning the mother translations?
GameSack Hoping to talk about Street of Rage remake.
GameSack Nice to see a fully translated version of rondo of blood now if someone could do the same for the japanese saturn version of SotN.
GameSack I wish yall made videos more often (once a week)! This is one of my favorite channels!!
GameSack the music in the mario homebrew around 7:00 is the petalburg theme from paper mario the thousand year door, thats why it sounds authentic.
GameSack at least Angry Birds on the Genesis takes advantage of the Genesis sound chip
GameSack Wait... A Sega Fanboy who was never into Sonic?????? :P Jeez.
GameSack i laphed so hard at this
GameSack My brother wouldnt stop playing Knack when he got it
GameSack play pony pony cash dash
GameSack Dont hate on that movie grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! :)
GameSack play Hungry Games on Newgrounds.com!
GameSack Ian: I didnt know the touch screen button was a buttonMe: facepalm
GameSack Looks cool. Give it us for free, its christmas! :D
GameSack U deserve way more subs
GameSack I remember playing Hole In One Golf. I rented it all the time instead of a game called Secret of Mana at BlockBuster. If only I could put that game on my nostalgia list.
GameSack Id think it be a good idea to do a parody sports game episode using games Im surprised you didnt use like Mutant League Football, Ring King, and goofy games like that.
GameSack suggestion: what about puzzle games or platformers next?
GameSack Cool video!Suggestion: do NBA Jam next time. :)
GameSack For a long period, really the only video games I played were sports games (mostly football). After I played Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, I got back into other genres (always loved the arcade classics though!).
GameSack Madden 96 has the UFC music theme?
GameSack I really enjoyed the episode, despite the fact that Ive avoided sports games like the plague after the 16bit era. I had totally forgotten about the early sports games on the Genesis.
GameSack Best Game Sack ending ever. It had me in stitches.
GameSack LMAO I forgot about the Madden ambulance. So funny
GameSack Du benutzt doch ein DIV changier Mod oder cool ich auch
GameSack That is just too random, you might as well put them to play mario party.
GameSack Now we can get interesting YCS again
GameSack huehuehueheuheuheuehueheu
GameSack well i guess i wont be playing at ycs anymore
GameSack Also, azneyes is bad at Geography as well as mathget your shit together broski
GameSack since the banlist no longer matters...can i have stratos back? naw, i think that this is good in some way because those that top will have to actually play beyond the meta and we will see quickly who depends on broken cards to much and who dosent. on the other hand, you are playing with a deck that you put together out of random cards and cant really test instead of the deck you felt comfortable competing with. well see what happens though itll be interesting to say the least.
GameSack Its the Americas because mexico and Canada are America also we are the united states
GameSack If its like magic theyll make valid packs put in white paper and then mark each card with a stamp to make it a little more fair
GameSack All they have to do is stop printing Sacky cards.
GameSack I went to The Lord of the tachyon galaxy and pulled nothing but mecha phantom beasts and other garbage. The strategy I had to use was wait for 3 cards in my deck those were two abyss scale of the mizuchi and abyssocea. So yeah I see how this draft idea sucks.
GameSack I could not agree more about Dragons FuryDevils CrushDevil Crash. I never really enjoyed pinball games, but I still play this one to this day.
GameSack What about the Colony Wars series on PSX? There were three, I havent played the second but I prefer the third, Red Sun, over the first because in Red Sun you can choose your missions and gain money to upgrade your ship. You couldnt do that in the first one, although the first did have branching paths and multiple endings.Then theres the SSX series on PS2. That would be interesting to talk about.
GameSack OMFG DAT PHANTASY STAR 4
GameSack 10:07 Sega Saturn shirt?
GameSack Streets of rage 2Sonic 2Xmen 2 clone warsPokemon goldsilvercrystalGalagaStreet fighter 2Mortal kombat 2Batman arkham cityRed dead redemption Nba streets vol 2
GameSack Please play gotham city racing for the XBox.
GameSack Dark Cloud was a fantastic game. Dark Cloud 2 was a masterpiece
GameSack Sonic 2 and Streets of Rage 2 are couple of superior sequels. I also would also include World Heroes 2 for the Neo Geo and Paper Mario Thousand year door
GameSack have you played the inazuma eleven series on the dses 3 improved a lot on 2
GameSack Later Joe used his Neo Geo to make a grilled cheese sandwich.
GameSack The most legit of legit videos ever!
GameSack Be easy with that Turf Masters!!
GameSack I bet it cant handle zx spectrum games :p
GameSack Thats the Classic Gamesack Sounds that i wanna hear :)Joe the Editing in this Clip is awesome.
GameSack You can play Hucards on the neo geo??
GameSack Such a versatile console! lol
GameSack what is the card slot on the NeoGeo really for?
GameSack Diggin that BowserRage Against The Machine crossover shirt.
GameSack Come on Dave, Zelda 2 wasnt that hard. Enjoyed the video as always.
GameSack You guys suck, Spot Goes To HollyWood on the Genesis is classic. It sucked on the Playstation, you should have reviewed that one.
GameSack did you guys kiss and make up?
GameSack Strider and Strider Returns on the Genesis. Strider Returns takes everything cool about the first game and throws them out the window. The tight controls, brisk pace, cool stages and awesome music are replaced with garbage. On top of that, the plot of Strider Returns involves reducing your girlfriend, how hackey is that?
GameSack All hail Game Sack!! truly a great show. I hope you guys never lose your spark.
GameSack Hey, Joe, I like that shirt! Is it supposed to symbolize how Capcom has apparently killed Megaman off?P.S.: I like your shirt, too, Dave!
GameSack I actually prefer the sidescrolling and experience system of Zelda II over the first one (wich ofcourse isnt bad either), even though i seem to be pretty lonely with thinking that.
GameSack Baff disch feiger Hacker! BDFH
GameSack FEA!  Fickt Euch Activision!
GameSack UHOD Ultimate hipster of doom ))))
GameSack COMMANDERS initzative gg Hustenzuckerl(hacker) )
GameSack BUFU  BY US FUCK YOU !!
GameSack (FYGP) Fuck you google plus
GameSack AHS anti hacker squad HKS hacker killer squad
GameSack AhAg  All hackers are Gay
GameSack Whats the point of saying where the music came from if they dont give us the musics name, Im trying to find that last music that plays on the credits but I cant find it.
GameSack I never found Dracula X Chronicles unresponsive, like at all, maybe Im weird... XD
GameSack When you have a 12 hour work day just sitting behind a computer. A lot of Gamesacking is going down. Thanks guys!
GameSack Nintendo do an update for the 30th anniversary :)
GameSack No love for Klonoa?Why...
GameSack I own Ubisofts Turtles in Time game for the PS3. If you missed buying it, then you did yourself a favor.
GameSack love your vids! keep em comin!
GameSack Yay I have zero mission, it was fun!
GameSack The remake of Cave Story was okay at best.
GameSack Sag mal, Fred, du hast es im Moment auch mit deinem Ton, oder? Oder hast du direkt nach 7 Days to Die aufgenommen und deswegen fehlt der Ton?
GameSack I met someone online that tried this with me. They got me the first few times, but then I ate them alive with screens and quick passes.
GameSack D was originality on the 3DO in 1994
GameSack So that Master System Card game is like the size of a large Word Document?
GameSack I used to have ghost house on cartridge, i loved it! hunting vampires was so fun :D
GameSack Majyoouo or something like that. If you search for King of Demons Super Famicom youll find the proper spelling.
GameSack One of my favorite horror games is Shivers by Sierra, which was released on the PC in 1995. Youre locked inside a haunted museum on a dare and in order to escape, you have to capture all the ghosts. Some of the puzzles are insanely tough and the atmosphere is genuinely creepy. Its definitely an underrated classic and its too bad it was never rereleased. A DS port would have been great. Im hoping it will show up on Steam, but someone has to remember it exists first.
GameSack I swear I need to come over and hold you guys up at gun point forcing you to make more videos! Forget all this vacations and working and all that crazy crap! Just videos now!
GameSack I use Game Collector 5.2 Pro. Great program. :)
GameSack Found it!! It is Kurosus Theme from Persona 2, specifically the PSP remaster.
GameSack NO!!!! DONT UPDATE!!!!! KEEP IT!!!!! I love it. Its like a ski lodge in there.
GameSack Not done watching but epic so fare :D
GameSack This one is a parody of those old Silent eras of Horror Movies. :D
GameSack Cool vid! How long did it take to make?
GameSack Thanks! There always fun to make. Although I cant speak for Joe as he has the hard part.
GameSack WOW! nice! Thanks for putting this up!
GameSack Thats awesome! I had a feeling lol. me too :)
GameSack Hmmm...this movie could have used a chic with bug tits walking around naked...like having antenna s coming out and shit
GameSack Dave forgot to wipe and wash his hands! I remember this from a year ago when people complained. Great skit!
GameSack AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Brilliant video. Happy Halloween Joe and Dave!
GameSack I love Shadow Squadron and Space Harrier. The rest of the 32x library can go suck it.
GameSack Nice vid guys!! Good times, I only got the 32x a few years ago and I love it for its qwerkiness lol, check out my channel if you get the chance, Ive made a few vids about my trials and tribulations with the nightmare that is the 32x
GameSack Its good to see someone not praising Mortal Kombat for a change. Usually I hear that its the king of the fighting genre. Its a good game, easy to play and fun in multiplayer... but really, Street Fighter is waaay better.
GameSack 32X Space Harrier and AfterBurner with the Genistick controller is arcade heaven for me, and reason enough to never sell my 32X
GameSack I gave knuckles chaotix a chance and i am so glad i did. I find there isnt much wrong with it. I think its a solid game and its worth a remake
GameSack 31:15 I have one of those PCs
GameSack Fahrenheit? Wow, I thought that theres only one Farhenheit (or Indino Prophecy somewhere else)
GameSack The guy in the left looks hi as hell!
GameSack Yes, better graphics, but v.r. deluxe doesnt have visual damage like the original v.r.!
GameSack I loved Ristar back then and was so hoping for a sequel. The voice samples never bothered me.
GameSack They did an amazing job with the graphics on Ristar. For the Genesis having a limited color pallet, the game gives you the illusion that the Genesis has a color pallet comparable to the SNES and the PC Engine unless with later Genesis games they put extra chips in the cartridges to give the games more colors. I dont know but later Genesis games look awesome.
GameSack I enjoyed Ristar on my Game Gear. The game is the same, just the graphics are dialed back a bit and the music has that 8 bit tone. Definitely one of the top games to own on the Game Gear.
GameSack Since the PS3, 360, and Wii are now considered retro consoles, can you please review more hidden gems and games that time forgot for the games on these systems?
GameSack Crash Team Racing sortve had 2 sequels. Crash Nitro Kart on the Ps2, and Crash Tag Team Racing on the Ps2, Xbox, Gamecube, and PSP. Oh, and whatever happened to the bonanza bros.?
GameSack Stunt Race FX owned so much. Hearing the sound effects is so nostalgic.Thanks for another great episode Game Sack dudes
GameSack Where the heck do you guys get all your awesome shirts? Are they custom made?
GameSack Mark of Kri was an awesome game.
GameSack One of my favourite consoles is the Original Xbox because its a lot of fun collecting the really good games that Microsoft just through away because Halo happened to be a smash hit. Microsoft you suck, bring back Stubs The Zombie, Voodoo Vince, Otogi, Phantom Dust, Brute Force and many more.
GameSack at least Bravoman have a cool webcomic from Shiftylook
GameSack I like the old mic better. This one you hear alot of wind blowing
GameSack I love pot roast!!! 94
GameSack Dolphins fan Tell my coffin slams
GameSack Lewis can u plz do splinter cell blacklist multiplayer
GameSack Lewis I have minecraft so we can play YAAAAY
GameSack Might be too inebriated for logic. Haha, Van Persie with a history of injuries now gets injured by the fitness regiment? Genius. Everton players didnt bitch and moan about a intense fitness program. How come cleverly wasnt let go a season or two seasons ago? I also remember getting beat 61 at home by Man City, a result which wouldve gotten moyes fired most likely. We also beat Liverpool at home this season as well... Give him the players he wants, spend a convincing amount of smart money in this season and the next and if he cant deliver champions league football next year hes done. Stopping pinning all the past failures of Fergie and the board on Moyes. The tactics need to change but there is more than one person to blame chaps.
GameSack I love Mancunians. I travelled with some for Holiday, just listening them to argue is hilarious.
GameSack look there are only two managers at the moment that i would want because of their style and strength of football and that jurgen Klop and roberto martinez, neither of which will happen
GameSack Hes not gonna get sacked. But even if he does get sacked. Get KLOPP KLOPP KLOPP KLOPP KLOPP KLOPP!! Klopp has 48 winning avg and 245 goal difference from just 244 games. thats pretty good for a coach of his age. Hes gonna bring back the winning mentality.
GameSack Bttner was outstanding during that game, he was by far the best player on the pitch. He showed so much passion and he was the only player for United who wanted to win that game
GameSack moyes changed backroom staff that were loved by the players and brings in phil neville!? that is a fuck up of impressive magnitude....souness did same thing at pool in 90s... it fucked them up for 20 odd years
GameSack Moyes doesnt seem to care that the champions are seventh. We desperately need signings and moyes comes out with what a lot of us expected and said players arent available when they clearly are like coentrao, sneijder etc. clubs like chelsea and man city continue to strengthen while moyes says we arent buying anyone. Almost seems like the glazers are refusing to allow money to be spent on players and are just bleeding united dry. They dont know anything about football and dont care about the club
GameSack LOL this guys a legend.
GameSack Is Gary Neville a possibility? Id love Klopp to leave germany!
GameSack LSWHO LSWHO LSWHO LSWHO. Rolllllll tide!
GameSack Mettenberger was a drama queen. Anyone else notice him trotting off after the clock ran out? It looked like the Oline was punishing him. He better gain their respect again lmao
GameSack Ive been looking for this great quality video. Thanks for posting.
GameSack This should go down as the Quad Sacks. I love LOVE LOVE how Mettenberger looks like a slug after the fourth sack. The dude can barely stand!!! The perfect way to end the game.
GameSack Les running a pass play on 4th in 28 down by more then 2 tds at the 2 minute mark in the 4th qtr. Then his qb gets hurt. What a ass hole.
GameSack Shades of the Sack Game against Alabama in 2005
GameSack Better than 2010? Better than 2827? Better than HeisCam? Not possible.
GameSack oh,,it would have been cooler the other way
GameSack FUCk USC.. Love, Die hard Cal fan
