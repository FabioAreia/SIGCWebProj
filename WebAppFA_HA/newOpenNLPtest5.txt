TopGear Runs to the Lottery shop
TopGear I think its probably worth the money
TopGear As soon as I finished the video I look at the picture on my wall of this car
TopGear The smexiest car I have ever seen :P
TopGear Thats Like a Car of A Demon
TopGear Does it have scissor doors?
TopGear gets paid to drive a 2M car in a 6 minute video.. I want that job. I would like to see that stacked up against a new model Corvette Stingray, GTR, ... and Veyron. 2 mile drag race.
TopGear man that thing just looks evil :D
TopGear Supercars are just getting more and more ridiculous every year.
TopGear haha I never realised they used mirror sails on mays carboat

TopGear Hilarious! Those guys are idiots!
TopGear Shouldve been bailing at the front so there is more weight is the back so it puts the nose up
TopGear James shouldve had a set of oars.

TopGear One of these days the Brits really need to consult a Science book or a dictionary, there is only one I in the word Aluminum.
TopGear James, I find your verbiage poignant and elegant in juxtaposition with the oafish moaning of the philistine you call Clarkson
TopGear Hah! I have the same sweater.
TopGear James May is a true gentlemen.
TopGear sireis i dont even know how they got that wrong.
TopGear If only I had money...
TopGear That car is waaaay too nice.
TopGear What is the name of music in 0:35 please!!!!!!
TopGear did anyone notice that the orange car was a s13.5
TopGear So damn cool. Make them regular guests!
TopGear watching this makes me wana cry honestly the monaro is a holden, its australian made  built allways has been its made in elizabeth, south australia  rebadged to get sales up overseas, its sold as all kinds of car brands,
TopGear I think if you want to make a drifting video, use a Toyota Sprinter Trueno Apex GT AE86. Please excuse any errors in the first sentence, but its a true classic.
TopGear God donuts outside the car
TopGear In United States we call it the Pontiac GTO
TopGear This, is the Pontiac GTO...
TopGear GTO still looks better in America
TopGear .........................................thats it........................top gear us sucks....
TopGear If Mario Kart was real, I would use this.. I can just mow the bananas on the race track lol
TopGear Pshhh. You call that fast? Stigs great grandmother moves faster in her coffin.
TopGear Alvin Straight should have had that Mower..
TopGear Umm you have just seen a bunch of people with too much time on there hands and nothing to do.
TopGear No way its still a lawnmower. The blade would have turned it into a hovercraft. I assume there is a flywheel in place of the blade, and there is a Honda motorcycle engine in place of a lawnmower engine..... this record is complete b.s. this is not a lawnmower.
TopGear At what point does a lawnmower cease to be a lawnmower?
TopGear Meanwhile in the F1 world...
TopGear I didnt know Honda had a Formula 1 team in development.
TopGear awesome docta!!!! The p1 is shocking, saw it in person a few weeks back, beast of a car.
TopGear Hopefully its faster than the Porsche 918 for Jeremys sake.
TopGear I wonder if Chris is the new Stig?
TopGear Amazing Video! Amazing Car! Amazing Driver!

TopGear Funniest top gear episode Ive seen. Epic
TopGear Power and flower tetouani matador
TopGear the orang utan as captain? wrong...very wrong
TopGear people would rather see innocent lunch goers getting drenched then seeing staged actors?
TopGear Really not a fan of TopGear but this one looked like fun!Pity that bellend Clarkson fried the motor though, all in the name of entertainment I suppose.
TopGear How do you have an LFA video that doesnt have an LFA exhaust note? Bad form.
TopGear Again, its a bonnet. Cars havent got hoods.
TopGear Every time you show an LFA, dont you know u must at least make us hear that V10? The dashboard is mind blowing! With Toyota engine, this beast gives Germans and Italians a run for their money as its so reliable. But I dont own one and thats the sad part :(
TopGear Im addicted to this video i watch it like 10 times a day
TopGear And thank you...for designing me ol frs )
TopGear Gimme bck that 60sec of my life.49sec for this vid and 11sec for typing this cmmnt.damn you.
TopGear Its neat, but nothing special in my mind. Especially for that kind of cash.
TopGear Title of a video Under the Hood literally doesnt show under the hood.
TopGear The programs come in Japan! That s just too cool Lamborghini after all
TopGear May I help you?Yes!You got one of these?No...

TopGear i couldnt help but just drop my jaw at that car holy shit!
TopGear Also this is not the first electric supercar, there was one before this but it never got marketing and couldnt sale. You can youtube electric super car and youll see it.
TopGear What in the name of god is powering this thing? A thousand German souls.
TopGear Dear Top Gear, i reckon iMercedes owe me an old Black.I have sorted out the battery range dilemma.Firstly trailers can be towed BY any iMercedes.Trailers can be any size.Replacing consumer envy and anger for petrol with just an oversized car trailer.So the media and advertising executives will be happy.The trailer will carry,SOLAR PANELS, enough to supply a domestic house or recharge in continuity a iMercedes.With enough amperage charge to allow the iMercedes to work all night long.The extra sized trailer can also work as an advertising bill board.Paying for the car.The excess power when not needed i.e. when parked can be sold back to the power companies also paying for the nights meal or lease on the street parking.Ideally the engineered trailer when parked would double as a street or off street car garage etcAla batiman engineering.Yeah thats way to hard eh.Regards Peter.Nice change of pace.
TopGear Electric cars and nuclear power are the way of the future. People dont seem to understand how safe nuclear power is theres only been 1 nuclear accident with loss of life in history (Chernobyl). People are so scared of radiation, guess what, people receive more radiation from the sun, from xrays and CT scans, and probably are significantly more likely to get cancer from breathing in the crap thats in coal and other fossil fuels then they probably ever will from Nuclear power.Problems my ass, nuclear will last for a very long time, is several orders of magnitude better for you than burning gasoline, and electric cars will be there to use the single source of energy with the best safety record when they make it.
TopGear This doesnt feel like anything Ive ever driven before. It feels twichy and nervous. It feels like a ...Can anyone help me? I dont understand him in 6:10Thanks
TopGear Petroleum Companies would love to see those Electic Supercars Disappear

TopGear Sei un mito ma dove lo vedi te ? la seconda parte quando arriva
TopGear can you do reliant robin next?
TopGear People who say 195,000 GBP is too expensive dont really understand the reason why people buy Aston Martins. My dream car is the Vanquish Volante. Yes, they are not as strong as Ferraris or Lambos, Id buy it simply because its emotionally beautiful and powerful. Power, Beauty, Soul
TopGear telling us the name of the song would be great
TopGear Aston martin is a luxurious car.. but when it comes to power its the powerless between other cars
TopGear The ford Taurus looks like this of course this dime came way first.
TopGear Well thats enough porn for today.
TopGear Grazie per i video che carichi!
TopGear American cars and European cars are better than each other AT DIFFERENT THINGS.
TopGear I wonder if they retested this experiment against a new 5.0L stang. Something tells me it wouldnt end the same.
TopGear comparing with a 10 year old car  fail.
TopGear Mustangs are poorly engineered, plain and simple. Doesnt matter how much horses or how big the V8 is. Place a V8 engine in a couch. Add wheels, you have a couch with wheels!!!
TopGear Haha, Triumph of British engineering! Havent heard that in a 100 years...American crap vs. British crap
TopGear Cant really knock lotus for being unreliable, considering ford just dropped into the bottom 5 makes for unreliability. Lotus isnt even on the list. Also, this video is from 2006. Ford may have better versions of the stang now, but lotus has upgraded as well...
TopGear American cars are pretty nice now.
TopGear 3:42 is it me or did it look like when they showed the mustang behind the lotus the mustang was breaking a bit ?
TopGear grazie mille io non riesco pi vedere niente per colpa dellantenna e mi toccava guardarli in ing mi hai salvato GRAZIE :)

TopGear 4:21 WTF?!?!?! ASSASSINS CREED 3 SOUNDTRACK?!?! :O
TopGear Mclaren MP412c and Audi R8! Are truly magnificent cars Ferrari Has the looks!
TopGear Love the ending lol Ferrari is just king end of story
TopGear Am I the only one how noticed the Assassins Creed theme here?
TopGear The episode has so much win cause theyre using the music from Assassins Creed 3 lol
TopGear 3:06 where did those sunglasses disapeared?
TopGear Jajajaj I really like your program and its comedy thanks
TopGear My favourite Ferrari of them all.
TopGear Wait what its over again?? WTF. Jeremy didnt even change his name yet!
TopGear I honestly was a little disappointed witg the special. It was a really cool idea, but some of the pranks were obviously fake, and after seeing those it sorta ruined the rest of the episode.
TopGear i thought they said that the p1 and 918 would go around the track in this series but if that was the last studio episode then when are we going to see it??
TopGear Has anyone noticed how fat Jeremy Clarkson is getting?
TopGear We need more manly shows with 3 guys that have amazing synergy. A DiY show. A video gaming show. Etc.TopGear cant be the only one that gets it right...
TopGear Congratulations for another triumphant series. For twenty two when you race the P1 against the 918 how about inviting someone fast along as well?I was thinking Andy Frost and Red Victor III would show you just how fast you think those Hypercars really are(nt). All the best and break a leg for the next series. )
TopGear Spelt Mclaren wrong in description..
TopGear Make more behind the scenes videos! :D
TopGear When does season 22 start?
TopGear Sei grande ... Metti anche la 19x07 quando riesci :)

TopGear Hi Jennifer Now say you dont like Porsche again,
TopGear True blue Scott there. hoho That accent.
TopGear Audi R8 V10 engine vs C63 AMG MercedesWhat would you take?
TopGear love her accent above all
TopGear You people who cant understand her youve just got to listen carefully im an 11 year old from south Africa and I understood her perfectly.
TopGear I am in love with this woman! Her accent is brilliant. The Scottish accent is by far my favorite! Her car knowledge is on point. Her T.G. Episode is one of my favorites.
TopGear I love the way she speaks, and how she loves cars, damn, shes a keeper.
TopGear I was just waiting for him to say bitch.........
TopGear Some say... if theres ever a MetallicA biopic filmed without the actual members in it... Aaron Paul would totally play Lars.
TopGear My Bitch can only get better....Soon hell be Breaking Good(meaning less) and riding that apex like a doubleloaded crackpipe.....YeeHa!!!!
TopGear Aaron Paul star of Breaking, Bad.
TopGear Apparently his pronunciation for koenigsegg is spot on. I work with a few Swedes who say the first G is smoothed over, something like Konasegg.Same thing with Porsche..people call it PORSH, while most Germans dont drop the E. Should be porshuh.
TopGear I came to this video with grammarnazi mode fully engaged. There is no way top gear would make a mistake like that... Oh...
TopGear How much meth did he have? And why didnt he call u a bitch?
TopGear Ever notice how celebrities say everything is great.
TopGear Guys, now that youre old I think that the only thing I have to say to you is what an awesome life!
TopGear I thought it was going to be slot cars
TopGear You guys have the greatest job in the world!!!
TopGear This humour and selfirony is just such a spectacular and distinct feature of the British. Amusing video in every aspect :D
TopGear Because the ferraris roof can only go up if the car is stopped
TopGear At wich airport is this?
TopGear The big crash hit Spain Hard ! Those modern ghost cities are a Trip !! I want to move their ! I would never clean ! I would just move into a new house every week )
TopGear all black ..very nice the dark sideHowever changing the channel name or bbc makes complaint
TopGear Piu episodi perfavoreeee
TopGear Hmm smells like subway surfer with more ads that I did not think the bbc could do?
TopGear Funny little hot hachback
TopGear To be honest the app really isnt that good :(
TopGear Some say... he never stopped playing when he went for the hot lap.And, even at this very moment, hes broken the alltime high 50 times.
TopGear U guys should make a game thats not shit.
TopGear That looks exactly like Subway Surfer... Like, an uncanny replica actually
TopGear Some say.. He live only to speeding the track, all we know he is THE STIG!!LOVED STIG... 3
TopGear Chyba zapomnieliscie podpisac tytul i opis filmu :)
TopGear I was so close to comment or of the week :( lol
TopGear FLDQfromMe: When are we going to see an Erica Torque super cut?
TopGear I seen a veyron go down my street but i got a Camaro rs which one is faster
TopGear its clear that my scrotum is
TopGear fast and furios is based on need for speed (the game) so why not havin a movie related straight to the game?!but the thing is that vin dieselpaul walker combination was pretty strong! so we have to wait and see the NFS movie, it must have a huge impact so it could go further!! cause we all gonna go and watch it but without the strong first impression were not gonna do it next time...
TopGear Hey just curious since I dont care enough to find out on my own. Is top gear America still running, or did it get canned? Cause it sucks compared to bbcs
TopGear ONE OF, THE BEST, FLDs EEEVVVVEEERRRRRR!!!!! 12,000 thumbs up !!!!
TopGear flqoftgeD that movie looks cheesy as fuck and lame straight to DVD after a week
TopGear For the GTR Nismo, the price is cheap for what it does. A 2013 GTR is way better and faster than a Audi R8 and its half the cost.
TopGear Ciekawe jak ten Golf r wypadby w porwnaniu z BMW serii 1
TopGear Jeremy, you asshole ... MORE! MORE MORE MORE!! :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
TopGear 620aaRRRRRR! for racing
TopGear the original footage from that camera must be amazing
TopGear Either buy a windscreen from the lesser Caterhams or put on a full face helmet. James is an avid motorcyclist and shouldnt really be adverse to wearing one in a car.I do however agree with him on the 160. That looks like fun!!
TopGear Why didnt they record the lap on the day when they reviewed the car? It was dry then.
TopGear Schumacher was the STIG only Once , when they tested the FXX, because no one else was allowed to drive itSo he HAD to be the STIG for THAT episode.The usual stig is a British F3 Guy with some ex F1 drivers filling in when they get something really hot.
TopGear One of my favourite cars in NFS:Shift 2!
TopGear Just great! NOT ! what was the time for the 620R, how did it stack up?Seems you video was a bit clipped at the end. Am i right???
TopGear Ive never been so disappointed in Top Gear. I want to see a dry lap and see where it ends up. How is 5 seconds slower than the R500 acceptable? The R500 got its YouTube fame partially because its so damn cheap. Give the underdog a fair fight!!
TopGear Im sure hes smiling behind that visor  impossible not to be!
TopGear Grandissimo! Continua a caricare video!! Era ora che qualcuno lo facesse.....sei un grande :D :D
TopGear Butbutbut ... what does it all MEAN?!? chuckle!
TopGear This TopGear Live looks awful.
TopGear i love how they upload these videos when im high :
TopGear You guys seriously need to play the live sound... were into car sounds, lol not just slow mo
TopGear never had the chance to see rhis :
TopGear are you all ever going to come to the U.S. and do top gear live
TopGear Come to singapore and do top gear live! Id definitely go :)
TopGear Bring to USA please. South Florida to be precise. Thanks
TopGear wet and wild.......sounds like a bad porno
TopGear Around 1:08 Stig brings up a very good point
TopGear That weather must get so depressing after a while...
TopGear 19 americans saw this !
TopGear Seria 2 to nie tylko nowa nazwa maego coupe na bazie jedynki. To take nawizanie do sportowych skojarze marki i przywrcenie jej troch porzuconego wizerunku producenta samochodw dla kierowcy.
TopGear TopGear has been dubbed in pretty much every language around the world.
TopGear Dubbing is the Work of Satan.
TopGear There are several translations into Castellano... two dubbers for each in Spain, as well as the Spanish American version...
TopGear Scandinavia, probably the only place where we do not dub shows or movies... in the woooorld.
TopGear The spanish of jammond is best xD
TopGear Common point: All translations are awful.
TopGear Original voices are the best...in Mexico we love this show...jajajaja....no hard feelings
TopGear hahahahaha Spanish was like real hamster :D
TopGear The song when Jeremy first drives the Mono is First Warning by The Prodigy.PROTIP Google search Top Gear songs and click on the link to the FinalGear forums, they have a complete listing of each episodes soundtrack.
TopGear Just sayin Gforce has very little to do with whats happening to Jezzas face in this clip.
TopGear Why dont the people who engineer these cars think Hey, why dont we put a cockpit type windshield on the car? Kind of like a fighter jet?Surely they can make one that doesnt weigh that much...
TopGear Driving without a helmet and then making an issue of his face going south. I suppose he has to cater for the wider audience. A well prepared professional wouldnt do it.
TopGear Check out this video on YouTube:
TopGear the future of FORMULA 1
TopGear Question: for a fun racing car with a decent engine and open world experience, why should i pay 100k for the Mono when i can buy an Ariel for less than half?Im kinda missing the comparison between both here.
TopGear How fast have all these tracked at
TopGear I shat myself laughing at Shanes face when Richard started talking Spanish!
TopGear Spanish is my favorite
TopGear The german translation of Top Gear is crap and thats so I watch the original version
TopGear Spanish (Spain) sucks!!!!! definitely prefer the original version
TopGear Spanish sounds like Argentinian and Spaniard! LOL!
TopGear Greetings from Mxico. Spanish dubbing is rubbish.
TopGear You didnt hear Estonian.. because we like see and hear the real thing ! So no stupid voiceovers, only a simple subs on the bottom! xD so cheers English language! xD
TopGear Actually I thought a little bit more about it and I think Jeremy Clarkson should be dubbed over with car sounds, and James May should be dubbed over with farm animals.
TopGear Voiceover is the indicator that a country is stupid and can not read subtitles!
TopGear So far Ive watched it in french and watched Top Gear USA. Top Gear UK is still the Best.
TopGear I meant Dubai is a city in UAE
TopGear in the Netherlands they just use subtitles
TopGear is this car faster then the Atom 500?
TopGear When can I try it in France?!!
TopGear You dont need one. But you need one because it is such a lovely thing. Well told
TopGear I will get the Atom first
TopGear A drag race between the ariel and the mono would be nice to watch
TopGear Hah Im watching on an iPad
TopGear the ultimate track toy, but if you do the math, it has a power to weight ratio 2 times lower than the Agera one:1. i think that with the mono you get much more than what you pay, considering the price of the agera one:1 and considering that the mono is not much slower on a track
TopGear They should testdrive the new Radical RCX Turbo coming out soon :D That would be awesome :D
TopGear I would like to see a behind the scenes clip of what you guys did to the zenvo ?? But i guess that would make you guys look like morons...
TopGear disgusting war propaganda.
TopGear and the guy below me is a total idiot
TopGear With all the taxes taken to build all the equipment to go to war in other countries nothing should be left behind it should all come back to its country of orgin to be reused sold to collectors or scraped to build something else theres no sense in leaving it behind for the country we were at war with to profit off of it when the citizens that pay taxes payed for it to begin with
TopGear For every: you know drink a shot :D
TopGear Top Gear should do a road trip where the presenter each pick a military Armorued fighting vehicle and they have to go from point A to point B.Dont tell me this cant be done in say Russia !
TopGear I remember Top Gear Live 2009 in Hong Kong. I had no idea it was taking place there but I happened to be on holiday in Hong Kong at the time (in February), and was in the shopping centre whose upstairs floor had been booked out for the show. At a later or earlier point (I cant remember), I saw Clarkson and his (now ex) wife queuing for a traincarriage ride back down a hill of some sort. No idea why Im telling you this.
TopGear Post the top gear live video!
TopGear wait a minute...ford...???FORD ????AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
TopGear Grandeeeee, continua cos ()
TopGear Vishwa narasimman The only two countries I know that goes rightsided is Japan and Great Britain
TopGear May as well bring in all the Avengers for a Reasonably Priced CarOff.

TopGear Tommy... I love you, but please! I love sleeping too! Its 2:35! Lemme sleep!
TopGear When is the next season of USA top gear coming !
TopGear I thought hed be driving a Jaguar
TopGear The cutie who did the introduction though.... !
TopGear lol, do Thor vs Loki to race each other :Di hope Loki wins :P
TopGear This is called 90 mile beach, because it is exactly 55 miles long. Made my day! :D
TopGear 90 mile beach, because its 55 miles long. LOL
TopGear It was blue JamesA trater hit it
TopGear For a car program, it kinda weird that cars hardly win these races!
TopGear 5:29 the door is blue again O.o 5:39 red hahahaha
TopGear the reason you dont like sailing is because you wernt getting stuck in.
TopGear I thought James liked sailing? Hahahaha.
TopGear If The stig is norwegian Im gonna guess its Tommy Rustad. He was the driver on the norwegian version of fifth gear a few years back and hes pretty damn good.

TopGear Ma la seconda parte ?
TopGear Well heck Top Gear, if youve got spare Porsche 911s to set fire to, you could alternatively give them to me?
TopGear Why use a 911 when you can use a nonmodified Gallardo? HAHA WINKWINKNUDGENUDGESMILE
TopGear I brought some brats!
TopGear pointless waste,i used to like top gear,now all i see is ego fueled presenters who get paid for thrashing,destroying cars people in the REAL world could only dream of owning,its gone from being a fantastic show which was informative to this show of meaningless excuse of entertainment
TopGear Kind of ironic how the GT3 has been delayed because it keeps bursting into flames
TopGear this is more slowed down than I expected. Look at the monitor in the background  you can see the individual frames, running 2hz. Assuming that theyre standard 60hz monitors, that means that in real time, these cars would appear to be going about 30x faster. Even if theyre 30hz thats pretty damn impressive.
TopGear i could watch this for hours ... all the small things look so amazing ... the slowly updating screen, the stage lights, the tyres spinning, the way the engine sucked in the flames in the end ... amazing. oh and the music is perfect for it too  btw anyone knows what it was?
TopGear hope you bring it Out the south Africa this year
TopGear CoolBeautiful.Nice Art.Thanks.
TopGear Here is a idea. Put a shoot out of home built super cars to the test!!! then put them up against the big boys of the industry. I know that at least 2 kit cars that can do this. the RCR superlite and the Ultima GTR. I think the Factory 5 company could do it as well.
TopGear Paul Walker or too soon?
TopGear Im sorry, cyclists of London, but Top Gear really did get this spot on.
TopGear I think this is the funniest thing Ive ever seen.
TopGear Cars drivers, this: (    ) is not 1,5m
TopGear I dont get it. Were not bomb experts.
TopGear As a cyclist, spot on. Too many people run red lights. Numpties.
TopGear haha this should be run as a safety ad in Vancouver
TopGear Hey Zog, we continue to watch your progress in the media with fond memories of the little guy you were when we first met. Your Dad would have been so proud!
TopGear I am a van driver, a car driver and a cyclist and would love to see Clarkson, May and most smug drivers, attempt to cycle though the London traffic.Like most people who bully others, they belittle cyclist because they are too frighted of doing it themselves. They moan about the very problem lazy buggers like them create. If you dont like traffic get up 10 minutes earlier walk, cycle or take the bus or train and leave the cars for those who really need to get around in one. I use other forms of transport and only drive when it is absolutely necessary, so I can appreciate what a luxury driving is.If you do drive pay attention to the road and use your indicators, instead of listening to the radio, texting, drinking coffee or adjusting your heated seats. Pay attention and you WILL see cyclists and pedestrians, who are the heros who dont create traffic, pot holes or take up parking spaces etc .If you find that you keep moaning about other drivers, you are most probably the problem.If you dont understand why cyclists do what they do try bursting your lungs out in the cold and rain instead of depressing your big toe on the accelerator of a nice warm car, and you too will also learn the difference.Road Bullies or Road Heros
TopGear Unless youre redgreen colourblind  then youre fcked.
TopGear PPPPPPOOOOOOWWWWWWEEEEEERRRRRRRRRR !!!
TopGear I just watch this on TV just now an decide to look it on TV. Disney never put any adds saying these people were even going to be on this show.
TopGear Oh this ought to be good! Has the episode come out yet? Thanks for sharing this with us and Jesus loves you! For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16

TopGear all marketing analysis... ) 25 of TopGear readers own a Rolex is their reasoning. So looking at it from a albeit nasty marketing POV  perhaps it will make som cheap watches flog
TopGear great vid archi keep em coming knowledable And comedy genious fuk thr haters
TopGear Are you aware that people can only afford watches in the magazine? It doesnt claim to be a watch guru magazine. Snobbery. Cheap doesnt mean shit. And by the way, 200 pounds isnt cheap for some people to spend on a watch.
TopGear I hope top gear get you on star in a reasonably priced car :D
TopGear The good thing about Clarkson is that he punched Piers Morgan in the face. ANYONE that punches Piers Morgan in the face gets a lifetime pass for ANYTHING. I would pay a years salary to box Piers Morgan

TopGear Jeremy, what on earth are you doing, ...Sigh... looks so wrong... 4:33 i know hes applying the cream to his bum but still LOL
TopGear Great special but doesnt feel as special as previous ones, shame that they have to script most of it makes it look very cheap. Like the scene where hammond is showering with james and jeremys piss and you expect us to believe that really was for real??? People arent that stupid
TopGear is it just me seeing them dressed like michael,trevor and franklin from GTA 5?
TopGear Wow! Those lorries are from Thailand! (The plate ids were Thai ids)
TopGear I wanna see more, where are the rest of this, awesome piece of film
TopGear I bet 90 of the things that go wrong on Top Gear are staged.

TopGear Top Gear Festival 2014!!! When I met Clarkson and got burnt...and other things
TopGear In Austria, we have AMG, and SClass Taxis. :D
TopGear Why havent Thailand Taxi?
TopGear Ive driven the manual for two weeks as a demo but glad I plumped for the auto. I use the paddles on the twisty stuff as I like to engine brake a bit and be in the best gear for pulling out of the corners. Love the car as most other road users just assume its a 120d or something then you pull away when they are doing 70 like they are stationary
TopGear U know what i always wondered. They mentioned that bump on the corner next to the tires before.. said every car has to hit it in order to take the corner perfectly... Why dont they just put tarmac in the space so the cars shock absorber doesnt have to take that unnecessary hit...
TopGear Its Burma, not India !!!!!!
TopGear cheers, couldnt make it this year!
TopGear I was really hoping for a corvette and gt3 test (among others but those namly)
TopGear If you cannot read the description then is it fair to abuse the uploader for your own lack of ability to read the description?
TopGear I was waiting for the engine to blow. Jeez, thats like 5k miles they put on just in that short stretch.
TopGear Hummer H1  towing a Boeing 777  1 mile per tank!
TopGear Top Gear extended thier play yeard to Eastern Europe!! now try that in Syria lol
TopGear They are crazy! Ukraine is almost under a brink of war with Russia. Driving towards a ghost town that is filled with radiation. I will tell the producers that they are fired. Putting their lives in danger and the possibility of getting cancer from radiation poisoning. The correct expression to say for this episode since they are from England. HAVE YOU GONE MAD??? Cheers, Flood!
TopGear Wheres the rest of it!!!!
TopGear I have the same Ford Fiesta, only in silver. :)
TopGear Is it just me, or does a visit by Top Gear increase a nations likelihood to experience domestic unrest? They went through Syria in 2010, civil war broke out in 2011. They visit Ukraine in 2013, and...
TopGear Turn on the air con. 15.. 25 right there.
TopGear 2:53 OMG i never thought that song would be here,I heard it in GT6 so this is a super surprise!

TopGear Love Top Gear,This one looks amazing
TopGear i see the showgod and jesus
TopGear Driving this car around can spell more doom than Hercule Poirot visiting Midsomer.
TopGear FINALLY a StigCam with corners!
TopGear The design and styling of this car is amazing but the drivability and control are terrible .
TopGear como sopla el turbooo
TopGear The car was offthrottle most of the time even on the followthrough Stig had to use the brakes.The way I see it is this  all the power in the world is useless unless you can control it and put it into good use.
TopGear He never went any higher than 3rd gear! Get that car on a dry track, I absolutely love it! (even if it spontaneously catches fire!)
TopGear you have to test it in the dry you stupid idiots! you would not be satisfied if this was a bugatti veyrons lap because everyone wants to know a dry time and not a wet!
TopGear Anyone know the song they used at the end of the review for this car?
TopGear Annoying review. He describes the car as Striking, intelligent, and unusual. Well Ill give him the last one. Though strikingly offensively hideous, pompous, and unusual looking are probably more fitting of this particular... Thing. It more closely resembles a lugi, or some sea creature youd expect to see only at great depths where the dark of the ocean would conceal is misshapen nose.Really dont like his offensive references to Jesus either. Great show, bad review.
TopGear When you look at this astonishing piece of art in form of a car and the music makes this more important than it is then you understand that this game was not just the best of all time but an emotional landmark for most of us!
TopGear Im Commander Shepard, and this is now my favourite car on the Citadel.
TopGear I would kill someone just so they could haul me over to jail in one of these :)
TopGear Im so happy Im Emarati
TopGear It will be interesting to see what will happen to Arabs economy when the oil runs out.....

TopGear Around 5:43 is hilarious, lol
TopGear hold on a sec...... I just noticed something I didnt earlier. At around 3:14or so, passing by the Alfa, is a red Ferrari.
TopGear What is the name of music at the beginning with the awesome beat?
TopGear quentyn73 are you stupid .. this is the best show on tv .. and if you dont agree youre an idiot

TopGear Hummer H3? A supercar? Hah!
TopGear Brilliant. Im laughing as hard as Matt Damon and Bill Murray!
TopGear Im pretty sure all Alfa Romeo 4Cs are dual clutch automatic transmissions. I dont think it would have been possible for the Stig to miss a gear.
TopGear If is real 1:24:8 is amazing for a 4 cylinder car!
TopGear Lovely. Ill take one, please.
TopGear And another good new...Alfa is preparing a hotter version with 2.0 liters engine and about 320 hp.

TopGear Come on so basically 1 new car again
TopGear Call of Duty has more original DLC than Forza Motorsport 5. Dammit Turn10 get it together. Whose grand idea was it to bring the H1 Alpha back? Like seriously?..... Thats just giving people a massive roadblock for drifting lobbies. This DLC should be free.
TopGear Just my personal list of cars I hope to see Turn10Studios : C7 Stingray, Jaguar FType, Ayrton Sennas McLaren MP44, any Porsche, 2015 Z28 Camaro, MB SLS AMG Black Series, some of the Tudor USCC racecars, Shumachers Ferrari F2002, 91 MB 500E, 55 Chrysler 300, 57 Jaguar DType, Lotus25, and the Williams FW14,

TopGear They need to add the chrysler pt cruiser and the range rover sport
TopGear Wheres my hovercraftvan?!?

TopGear My dad has a white C63 sedan (4 door)
TopGear Woooooooooo first comment.
TopGear PLZ make a caterham r500 circuit build!!!!
TopGear You should do a challenge like that with old muscle cars
TopGear hey dude we upload the same content and i almost have 1,000 subs maybe we could play together it would be an opportunity for both of us :)
TopGear I remember not knowing how to unlock stripminetook foreverwhich made me love the game even more

TopGear Heres an idea, get 3 people, meet up at the airport. 2 people get in a plane and the other gets in any car of their choosing. Race to mount chillad but the plane users have to land at sandy shores airfield and take a car to the top of mount chillad. Hope you havefun!

TopGear DO MORE GTA RACING ON CUSTOM MAPS
TopGear We should buy a fiat I have one (second of silence)
TopGear Where is the livestram?
TopGear So need to play forza with you guys
TopGear Hold on, Did I hear you say drifting with 200bhp is hard? Really? Well, I think you need to work on your techniques, using momentum and such, because if an 86 with 200bhp is hard to drift then either you arent running the right difficulty setting or you arent shifting the weight in the car correctly. You should be able to shift the weight with a feint or braking drift in an 86 easily.
TopGear i used to play this round my mates house was fun. My fave ever top gear episode is vietnam
TopGear the thing I hate about this game is the instant explosion when you bump against a wall or something, it feels so riduculous. fun game though, but not a great racinggame
TopGear Top Gear Overdrive totally beats Gran Turismo! (I really hate that game!)Anyways i dont know why but i really like the floaty controls of the Top Gear games ... it kinda gives the games a really unique feeling.
TopGear yeah.  I think Im gonna pass on this one.  I dont like to brag, but Im really good at racing games.  I can breeze through everything from Burnout to Fzero GX within a few hours.  With the way you built this game up, Id probably finish it in one sitting.
TopGear Hi I wud like to play with you guys
TopGear Come ti invidio quella pelle luminosissimaaa!svelami il tuo segreto:)ahahah un bacio!
GameSack Just use listenonrepeat.

GameSack Best song in League of Legends!!!
GameSack I play my league games with this song
GameSack the other guy is so fucking annoying
GameSack Its a way for RiotGamesInc to make money without taking it from us directly. If people want skins, we buy them and RiotGames gets money, this is just another port to please the people and earn money. Pretty sure Tobuscus has a similar tendency to giveaway. I do enjoy your usual sassyness to large companies though, Will :)
GameSack jacie87 I feel like the monies made off of the videos are like their royalties for their work on the production and therefore they are entitled to keep those profits. And honestly, some of it is likely going to go back into their future production budgets just like most content creators do, so as I said, I think theyre entitled to keep that money and use part of it toward future projects. :D
GameSack TheWillofDC Will, when you get the skin, you have to connect through googleyoutube to confirm and get the skin. Youtube obviously monitors its transactions with other companies and decided its ok and in their best interests.
GameSack Youtube ISNT a government body. What Riot did WASNT ILLEGAL. The way its established is verified by Youtube itself so that you CAN UNDER YOUR OWN FREE WILL, SUBSCRIBE. Youtube ISNT POLITICS, God.
GameSack TheWillofDC the thing here is the diference about a big company and ppl in their room making videos and making money, ofc they gonna get more subs there4 more money, and i play the game i enjoy it the new update is fairly ok, and i wanna see more ppl subbed to riot cause if u go there and watch the videos, they talk about the champions on the game and about fan art, updates and stuff, but most important is a normal channel and the content is equal to machinima or ign youtube cant do much
GameSack FreddieW should just make the movie better with that extra money. Steve, your evil laugh is coming along. Have you chosen your evil villain name?
GameSack Steve is like Wills personal troll XD
GameSack TheWillofDC Thats right. No virtual crap. I want a real one.
GameSack TheWillofDC, I have good news for RiotgameINC as well, as of this morning they won Best Free to play Online game On the Golden Joystick Awards. Also I will be making a post with a link on the Riot forums to this video (I apologize if some homophobic pricks show up however)
GameSack Next episode, smosh will be loser.  Fucking machinima passed them again.
GameSack Theres a frame of an old episode in the end of the video :D
GameSack switzerland says hello as well! watch you since like a year :)
GameSack yeaaahh!! werevertumorro!!
GameSack sprbadguy He is more of a man than you.
GameSack coughs evar heard of trollbaiting?
GameSack 1w4nn4 I agree, its ridiculous that she is climbing so quickly, shes almost overtaken Tobuscus!
GameSack VICTORY! thumbs up if you get it
TopGear Top gear usa lo mximo,el mejor programa de autos :D

TopGear Lmao that drag race was awesome
TopGear Tanner is horrible with girls XD Im pretty sure he is just acting :p Top Gear UK is so such much better though!
TopGear Ive bitched and moaned about the voices so much, but ya know something?... I love this show so much, Ive discovered I no longer really care. The only part that still gets me is how the camera sort of shows the sky and not the action a dozen or so times per video.. that part still sucks. lol
TopGear am i the only one who would want the Toyota over the rest maybe the dodge for a laugh
TopGear if adams axle did not snap he shoudt of won
TopGear Bring Concorde out of retirement for Jeremy
TopGear THIS IS GONNA BE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear Jennifer and May. My two favourite people in the world
TopGear its got nothing to do with how obsolete tv stations are becoming. The problem is that certain TV shows in certain countries are not paying enough money to get the shows on air. Peer to peer acts as an avenue to advertise the show people that do not have a huge budget normally use peer to peer to advertise their products, and it is proven that they still make a lot of money using peer to peer as an advertising tool. Making back money with DVDs etc etc. Game of Thrones is one of the most pirated TV shows ever but they still make over double the amount of money that they put in the show
TopGear FFFFF HES HERE IN TORONTO AND I HAVENT EVEN GOT A CHANCE TO MEET HIM YET
TopGear The speakers are cool but how the hell do you not get distrackted by them?
TopGear Lol how about you show the good people whole race. After 3 laps Erebus got their arse handed to them by the Super bike, Red Bull F1, and the Time Attack Mitsubishi Evo. The bike came first, Evo and F1 equal second and the Merc 3rd by a long shot followed by the GT3 Merc and WRC Corolla.
TopGear How could heshe dislike this video??
ZONEofTECH Has anyone told you, you look like captain sparklez?
ZONEofTECH (Rote this before watching the entire video.) If apple makes one, they can try and make a better one than the ones that are already out. lmao They can look at the current ones and make theirs better.
ZONEofTECH Um lol they have already released a smart watch. Go on the website and see for yourself.
ZONEofTECH This should solve Americas obesity problem!!!!
ZONEofTECH Dude, you should get a lav mic. Itll really help the quality of your videos.
ZONEofTECH poorboy in a fueter video, so maybe in the past to?
ZONEofTECH The same stuff he is saying is the same stuff people are guessing on the web... Ask yourself how does he know all of this again???
ZONEofTECH Smart watches are useless, why not do things the old fashioned way? Its really not necessary to have a smart watch..
ZONEofTECH I have one nano 6 with a wrist band :D
ZONEofTECH One because two is going to a long time
ZONEofTECH Number 2 is the Best!
ZONEofTECH I like the first and second one
ZONEofTECH We wanna hear from u more often!!!
ZONEofTECH i like number 1 concept,,,
ZONEofTECH 1  2 iPhone 6 CONCEPT
ZONEofTECH number 1 is so sick!!
ZONEofTECH Of course apple is probably going to blow everyone away like they always do and only one of these ideas will be right... Like it usually is. I sure apple has some surprises in store.
ZONEofTECH that guy holding the iphone as virtual guitar is Babak Ferdosi the guy working for NASA , he was a part of curiosity mission to Mars :D
ZONEofTECH Sorry but all of the iPhone 6 videos are a complete lie an when you reply I will tell you why
ZONEofTECH Almost 200.000 views and 2243 LIKES!!I simply have no words for this!Youre all amazing! A thank you simply isnt enough..So Ill go with a bolded THANK YOU!:)
ZONEofTECH Iphone 6 will be an iphone5 just renamed.I find it funny how people always believe the leak pictures of iphones how they are made of glass or about 4mm thick.Steve jobs said they will never make a smaller ipad, yet they did because they wanted to compete with the 7 tabs.Same thing here, they will go 400ppi if they must to compete.
ZONEofTECH Yesssss apple made another shitty simple ass I phone I bet all the simple ass people bye this simple ass shitty phone sounds about right way to go apple another year waste of bullshit . . .
ZONEofTECH I expect to see apple doing a lot to try and compete with the Samsung note 3. I do see the possibility of it being water proof and having a solar panel on the back, thats a lot of unused real estate thats perfect for a solar panel. I think it can be water proof if it solar charges or pad charges and has wireless headphones and touch sensitive buttons (no pressure). I think they really need to increase the internal speaker though. Im hoping to see 128 as a standard capacity and enough power to run mac software cross platform. The ability to run mac software would definitely dominate the competitions offerings for software on the go.We need desktops on the go that can go to the beach swimming with us lol. I would also like to see the nanos radio put into the phone for dataless radio on the go.
ZONEofTECH wake me up when apple make a full HD screenfaster processer.
ZONEofTECH dude u look like the guy from the amazing spiderman
ZONEofTECH Your videos are too long.
ZONEofTECH Apple is stupid, they could have released a bigger screen with the same resolution years ago, the PS Vita has slightly lower res but is quite a bit larger (5) and still looks great.
ZONEofTECH Whats the price of the Samsung galaxy s5?
ZONEofTECH so does the gear have a cam?
ZONEofTECH SAME SONG AGAIN AND AGAIN...
ZONEofTECH Just remembered that I forgot to add transition effects!! DANG IT! I did the final touches at 6 a.m (spent the entire night working on this  again) and apparently completely forgot to add those :(
ZONEofTECH apple is going to have a 5.5 inch screen for the iphone 6 ,but thats when the note 4 comes in with way better features than iphone 6 and s 5 .the note 4 will have 5.9 inch screen
ZONEofTECH I feel so outdated I just got the s3 last june
ZONEofTECH Keep up the good work..Excellent presentation....
ZONEofTECH actually some people are saying that it will be unveiling touch wiz 5
ZONEofTECH If the back is full aluminum, then Ill be pretty impressed if Apple somehow pulls of phone calling, and any signals in general.
ZONEofTECH It looked very similar to the galaxy did anyone notice that
ZONEofTECH If this is the real iPhone 6 I dont really like it as it has a bigger screen and they are copying Samsung and they dont want to do that!
ZONEofTECH The iPhone 6 you shared Kind of looks like a Samsung phone
ZONEofTECH It was a fake I just now bought my I phone 4, waiting to get the I phone 6 when it comes out.
ZONEofTECH it is called CONCEPT...!
ZONEofTECH when will this iphone 6 out?
ZONEofTECH So...completely off topic, but anyone else notice this guy looks like David Tennant and Andrew Garfield had a baby?
ZONEofTECH Santas A Jerk ! He didnt give anything ! NOT EVEN AN IPHONE 5C IN PINK !
ZONEofTECH I got a penny board and some iTunes gift cards
ZONEofTECH I didnt get anything haha .....
ZONEofTECH I didnt really get anything :(Instead I jailbroke my iPad Mini on iOS 7.0.4
ZONEofTECH Sphero,ahhhhh,in my hand,playing,Im not to Old for this,at 46.I never have This kind Of toy since childhood,we only enjoy in trumpo,holen, at tumbang preso.
ZONEofTECH I got money lol...Plz pm me if I won
ZONEofTECH Santa gave me time to spend with my family.
ZONEofTECH I would love to get this device in complementary to my iPhone 5. Your video is amazing very detailed and indepth. Love it!
ZONEofTECH Nice videos!, i found it really helpful
ZONEofTECH NEW VIDEO!Batman Arkham Origins on the NEW 15 Retina MacBook Pro!Performance test

ZONEofTECH Yall should stop hatin he is trying his best to entertain us with these nice fones he takes his time to show us
ZONEofTECH dude,why dont you compare Nokia 3310 and iPhone 5S? this video is pointless.
ZONEofTECH Yeah ok so firstt the iPhone 4S is actually made for iOS 6.1.3 but is COMPATIBLE for iOS 7 while the 5C is actually MADE and OPTIMISED for iOS 7 so it would be more fair making the same tests with the 4S on iOS 6.1.3 and the 5C on iOS 7 !!
ZONEofTECH I still have the iPhone 4 O.O
ZONEofTECH The 4s has the mail up while the 5c doesnt.
ZONEofTECH Are you from Czech Republic?
ZONEofTECH Im just saying its fast
ZONEofTECH isnt a fair test! put ios 6 on iphone 4s, and test again! ios 7 is rubish!
ZONEofTECH iPhone 5s Space GreyiPhone 5c Yellow
ZONEofTECH Gold iPhone 5s, Green or Blue 5c. Those are the ones Id pick.
ZONEofTECH the white one looks best
ZONEofTECH ya know the sleek design makes me think of the early 1900s cars and their colors
ZONEofTECH I got iPhone 5S and i like the space gray color.

ZONEofTECH Who cares about the box just get on with it
ZONEofTECH Im always a fan of Nokia phones. Well, quality is awesome. Phones are designed to have distinctive features among others. Windows OS is not the  most famous os among others BUT this is how nokia impressed their consumers. Quality phones and cool OS: that is how Nokia works. I will buy this phone soon. I just hope that 32gb will be available in Ph. Nice review. Good job.

ZONEofTECH Hello All, I am getting both, the 5C  5S. I gave away my S3. Oh.......I have both the S4 and Xperia Z and also getting a Note III. Just buy what you like. Dont hear too much of reviews and others. You like it, buy it.....simple. Life is simple. Dont make it hard on yourself. Apple, Samsung, Sony and others are all great technological entities. Take care. Merry Christmas All.
ZONEofTECH Its 40X the original iPhone
ZONEofTECH Thank you for doing a quick overview of the 2013 Apple event. Good to see some product innovation again and a cheaper version as well that still has good product features. I am still interested to see if a 6 inch version comes out.
ZONEofTECH Hey great video man but those figures that say 40X and 56X are the improvements it has had since the original iPhone .. Just a heads up!
ZONEofTECH Whats the ending song?
ZONEofTECH Go back to the 1950s old man! Any nonparinoid person would buy one.
ZONEofTECH Number one again. I love Samsung :)
ZONEofTECH what about apple ! anything soon .
ZONEofTECH I wasnt taking to you, I was talking to Mr Android is Poopoo over there.
ZONEofTECH The phone isnt even out and youre already hating. Well thats quite pathetic.
ZONEofTECH i think you need severe medical help, you have several mental disorders including neurological deficit(reducing your ability to complete simple tasks such as spell words) and Histrionic Personality Disorder (causing you to overreact). i apologise for my delay in replying as i had to study for several weeks the symptoms you portrayed in you comments to figure out your physical illnesses. Get well soon my friend!!!
ZONEofTECH Android is poopoo, get it through your head.
ZONEofTECH When do you think apple will confirm this?
ZONEofTECH I use an lg optimus l9. Android for life!
ZONEofTECH I have an iphone 4 and I love these new windows phone commercials
ZONEofTECH Dont really care about iPhones
ZONEofTECH in my country this cell phone cost 1100 dolars
ZONEofTECH Currently: PS3. Im sticking with it instead of paying an annual online fee for PS4 or Xbox One.
ZONEofTECH Thus guy looks gay at the very beginnings
ZONEofTECH You mean Ouya station 4.
ZONEofTECH Actually, I believe I was the 1st one to see the video )) Cheers Vakaris and congrats!
ZONEofTECH When I take a picture with a highlight out the sun, it turns everything dark to try to reduce light. Is there a way to stop that.
ZONEofTECH Its all legit because I have a iPad Air and its all the same...
ZONEofTECH The iPhone 5C isnt made of cheap plastic its made of polycarbonate which is not cheap.
ZONEofTECH What about the note 3...? Any cool features on this phone.
ZONEofTECH I think they should come out with a new nexus 4, or possible a nexus 5. I would love the big screen. It would basically be a cheaper google play edition galaxy s4
ZONEofTECH Great video. Definitely subscribed!
ZONEofTECH Anything with an HDMI port is going to work.
ZONEofTECH It works for me but the audio doesnt any suggestions
ZONEofTECH Hey its me again and sup
ZONEofTECH I like your videos but OMG 600D
ZONEofTECH Little bit too long! But i enjoy it!
ZONEofTECH Wei wer wie der Song heit?
ZONEofTECH I know that. The S3 Mini had it as well but Samsung removed it in a software update. Anyway, did I say in the video that only the S4 has this feature?
ZONEofTECH They should stay with the metallic features the plastic and translucent iPhone make it look cheap and too fragile
ZONEofTECH Theres gonna be a regular 5s, the successor to the 5, and maybe the plastic version if apple is actually working on one.
ZONEofTECH How far away is Romania from Belarus I live in NY now but good videos
ZONEofTECH Dude thats cool, 2nd to watch thisXD
ZONEofTECH seems to me like your getting real bothered by how good iphones are but dont worry if you stop being stupid on the internet and get a job oyull be able to aford one of these jewels like all the other rich people

ZONEofTECH Please make a video how to get Siri on IOS 7.
ZONEofTECH How do you get it on ios 7?
ZONEofTECH Does your iPad have a pixel distortion... Or is that mine???
ZONEofTECH Ive tried Beta 1, 2 and 3, And i still cant get incoming calls. Tried many different downloads, and they still dont work. Why am I not getting incoming calls, i can make calls, and i can text etc.
ZONEofTECH I hve a baggage tag on the settings icon but it says its up to date? What do I do?!
ZONEofTECH Chuck Ihekwaba i need your help bro can you help me install IOS 7 to my iPhone 5, i do not get nothing everybody says. PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME!!!
ZONEofTECH i have the beta 1 installed on my 4s but there are no software update what should i do?
ZONEofTECH Hey Jonathan, I did a video on how to fix this infinite loop issue. here it is: FIX infinite boot loop (bricked iOS device): watch?vLSTZHtdXyoI
ZONEofTECH try it now guys! This .kappleos7.om is amazing! Get your iOS 7 Beta 3 !
ZONEofTECH Hey, I did a video on how to fix this infinite loop issue. here it is: FIX infinite boot loop (bricked iOS device): watch?vLSTZHtdXyoI
ZONEofTECH i advice people to just wait until full version, but its your phone so do whatever.
ZONEofTECH what if the first 2 betas wouldnt install on iphone 4s. Like I shiftUpdate and it verifies with apple server but then during the preparing iphone for software update it reboots to recovery mode and reboots yet again to a blank screen?
ZONEofTECH Yeah I know.... Anyway, my iPhone usually restarts like every 2h or so. Besides the restart, apps crash extremely often (although for some reason, I wasnt able to show that in the video). This is indeed, just the BETA. The finally version should be buttery smooth.
ZONEofTECH ios 7 beta 6 is now available.
ZONEofTECH Why didnt he compare Safari with Internet Explorer?
ZONEofTECH well..... thats one good point lol
ZONEofTECH I am really impressed with the way you handled this video. It is filled with a lot of information about the product. I just would like to know if the OS X Mavericks is equipped with a better antivirus? Come on, everybody loves the way it fights bugs and other threats but there is not always enough.
ZONEofTECH 1st view and 1st comment
ZONEofTECH Great video, productions was very well done I thought. Glad I came across the video, its always nice to find a channel that puts in some effort for their audience. You seem to know what you are doing, congrats you have a new active subscriber.

ZONEofTECH How do u download because it says dmg isnt working
ZONEofTECH ZONEofTECH do i have to restore first before installing ios 7?
ZONEofTECH Still saying firmware isnt compatible .
ZONEofTECH it doesnt work tho forreal
ZONEofTECH Thank you! Thank you! Even though I didnt use this exact fix, you gave me an idea of something to try to get my phone working again. After a week of not restoring, I thought it was bricked. You saved my digital life!
ZONEofTECH This is so retarted. The point is it says firmware isnt compatible, so how are your instructions any fucking different. Downvote this shit.
ZONEofTECH Viewers! YOU MUST READ! you do not need recboot what you really need to do is hold power and home buttons for 15 seconds until itunes recognizes your iphone in recovery mode then choose your ipsw then your done
ZONEofTECH When you said Just throw it in the trash can its usless. I nearly shit my pants.
ZONEofTECH the link says not to use it on a 64x what to do i still downloaded it and its not working
ZONEofTECH recboot for x64 systems does exist?
ZONEofTECH iOS 7 beta 1 and 5 cannot update on my iPhone 5 GSM now I still using ios 7 beta 4
ZONEofTECH will it erase my photosdata..?
ZONEofTECH thank you so much i thought i would never be able to fix it :)
ZONEofTECH Hey there. Im getting error 3194. How do I fix this?
ZONEofTECH Can I do it on and iPod touch 4g by using the iPhone 4 beta version???
ZONEofTECH BTW how do I know which link is for my iphone 4 as there are 3 links
ZONEofTECH how do you know what model iphone 5 you have?
ZONEofTECH hey this will not work i opened the MEGA link and it is not ipsw file it was a dmg file PLEASE ANSWER!!!!!
ZONEofTECH you were meant to back up
ZONEofTECH WHAT LINK DO I GO TO FOR THE IOS 7 BETA
ZONEofTECH When i download it off of MEGA it isnt like a file like i cant extract it with winrar or anything its like a white little folder and i try to put it on notepad and it says file to big.....
ZONEofTECH please tell me da reason i did evrything like he said above but when i clicked on software update after finishing evrything it shows that your software is up to date i am disappointed sir pls give a method to make it success
ZONEofTECH Yeah, 469 ppi. Sorry about that :)
ZONEofTECH I have the Iphone 4 running ios7.... worst mistake... Media player Stops all the time!!!  this is the worst update they have made so far.  Their best selling point of their stupid iphones is now a piece of shit. Shame apple... Shame
ZONEofTECH so the music player is going to be FUCKING PINK!?? i hope i can change that, otherwise im not gonna update.
ZONEofTECH ALL WHITE AND PINK???? Are you fucking kidding me Apple.... fuck piss shit ass ARGHHHHHHH!
ZONEofTECH nothing a little VPN wont fix )
ZONEofTECH PINK!? Theyve clearly recruited a female lead designer where pink has been her colour preference! Women, pffff...
ZONEofTECH heheheheh 101 dislikes ! asshole !
ZONEofTECH I feel like Im taking crazy pills.
ZONEofTECH iOS has proven that they are the best. AGAIN
ZONEofTECH Hey fandroids do what your heart tells you and get an iphone
ZONEofTECH The Android fan boys are so butthurt over Apple. Get a life. Bump your phones to your faces.
ZONEofTECH LOL 0:51 He owned Samsung.
ZONEofTECH Its called all share cast.
ZONEofTECH It not so interesting...(my opinion)..
ZONEofTECH bump each other phone android got fucked !!!
ZONEofTECH This guy knows what he is talking about
ZONEofTECH Yes !! I got iOS 7 Problem is when will the beta expire i just wanted to know ........
ZONEofTECH NO ONE CARES... No Offense.. Im only telling you this because iPhone has always been better at actually working correctly with ease
ZONEofTECH The card multitasking is borrowed from webos. Such a shame webos didnt make it.
ZONEofTECH BECUASE its not google
ZONEofTECH Weve integrated live search results from Bing... silence
ZONEofTECH I love the silence when they mention Bing search results lol
ZONEofTECH For all you android users here bashing apple, why are you watching the video on apples new os? Why dont you go use the most advanced os?
ZONEofTECH Please leave a comment about it
ZONEofTECH And it might come out later coz Im in Australia
ZONEofTECH I LIKED NOW WERES MY IPOD TOUCH XD
ZONEofTECH Yes, it is. Check Apples website.
ZONEofTECH I downloaded the one for Oceania and then 12 it stopped at 99 and every minute the countdown goes up by 1 second :( Updates at 33 and not moving a millimetre
ZONEofTECH Dont waste time on other websites !!!It is the only way to get free Riot RP codes Really working: FreeRpCodeGenerator. com.All gift codes are checked, they really work
ZONEofTECH i cant fucking play my game cause i turned off the mac and it went away!!!!!
ZONEofTECH add me my name is...... is....... IDK XP
ZONEofTECH Maybe I will get my hands on updated Xbox 360 firstx
ZONEofTECH It has the same face plate because it was a demo not the real Xbox
ZONEofTECH no they already said it wont
ZONEofTECH crisisish?! interesting choice of words.. So the battery will degrade eventually forcing a new purchase in controller?
ZONEofTECH Your mothers bush guys
ZONEofTECH Lol not really i was not hooked by the conference at all and Ive been gaming on xbox for almost as long as I have been for playstation.
ZONEofTECH Kind of bummed how they decided to still use a disk drive.would have preferred games to be sure stored in memory cards of some sort
ZONEofTECH You seem like an amazing honest great guy! I hope to win the iPod 5th gen because Ive always wanted it! If I win, please contact me katie.heartz.j.beiberhotmail.com and please subscribe to my channel :)
ZONEofTECH New name for video Cydia Tweaks 2013
ZONEofTECH r u fucking kidding me?!
ZONEofTECH Concept 5  Thumbs down Concept 4  Thumbs down Concept 3  Thumbs down Concept 2  Thumbs down Concept 1  Thumbs up
ZONEofTECH Number 1 because some people want a new layout for the homescreen and Im one of those people.
ZONEofTECH The first and fith were the best
ZONEofTECH I like the last one the most.
ZONEofTECH Thats very awesome! I am very excited for iOS 7 this fall.
ZONEofTECH I might not get it. The rumours of never shutting off and no disk drive kills it for me. But, I love Microsoft and their games so maybe, in a couple of years, I will get it. :)
ZONEofTECH S3 Mini. But I honestly suggest waiting for the S4 Mini to be released (should be released in JuneJuly). By the way, have you seen my S3 Mini vs iPhone 4S EPIC BATTLE? if not, check it out here: youtube.comwatch?vPghxzJE5eg It is basically the most detailed review of the S3 Mini, on YouTube, so please check it out. Cheers mitsostrianta30!
ZONEofTECH Probably geared towards the teenage market. Adults will stick to the original
ZONEofTECH I think that this is legit and yes I think the plastic is for me even though it could have been better
ZONEofTECH Its not 300 ! Its 99 for 16gb  200 for 32 gb on selected carriers apple said it ! Go kill yourself dumbass !
ZONEofTECH C probably stands for china as it probably will be manufactured there and it would be cheap as its Chinese... No offence... If its under 200 then I might consider...
ZONEofTECH 5mp camera i better keep my i4s
ZONEofTECH Thats a stupid rumor. Why would apple make a iPhone 5 mini with a 4 display if the iPhone 5 has the same screen size. If they make a 3.5.. Oh wait they already have one and its called the iPhone 2g,3g,3gs, 4 and 4s. Ive been watching a lot of your videos and half the rumor and specs you name and say they are definitely true, you get them wrong. The galaxy s4 specs for example.
ZONEofTECH :))) ppi means pixels per inch. The human eye is not a display, it is basically a video camera, so it does not have any ppi. You probably mean the ppi above which you cannot distinguish the pixels on a display. That number is 300. examples: The iPhone 4,4S and 5 has a ppi of 326, while the Galaxy S4 has 441 ppi. Everything above 300 means that you wont be able to see any pixels on the screen when viewed from up close. I hope you found this helpful!  please SUBSCRIBE, LIKE and SHARE :)
ZONEofTECH iphone sucks! good luck with that apple. androids the best and samsungs the best company.
ZONEofTECH iphone the best samsung galaxy sucks
ZONEofTECH Totally agree, if only it was supported by modders..
ZONEofTECH Its not going to be a huge upgrade over the S3 Mini. The design will suffer some minor changes, the camera will be upgraded to an 8MP one, but other than this an a minor speed bump, there will be no major changes.  some unique S4 features might be coming to the S4 Mini, such as Air Touch, dual cameras and so on My suggestion is to get the S3 Mini now and sell it when the S4 Mini comes out. Anyway, if you have any more questions, feel free to ask me! Cheers Hardrocker98!
ZONEofTECH should i wait the s4 mini ? ( i want a better cam thatn s3 mini and little better gaming ) btw i find s3 mini s size really good . so what should i do ?
ZONEofTECH I really want the s3 mini but Im not sure Id the camera is good
ZONEofTECH Just got the s3 mini It is great the thing that could be fixed is the camera thats it
ZONEofTECH You can get a micro SD card slot for 2.
ZONEofTECH Part 6 is up, as well as the Main video which includes part 8 and the results of the EPIC BATTLE! Cheers! julien
ZONEofTECH im sure that the s3 mini Has the noise cancelling mic
ZONEofTECH You can in Temple Run 2, and it looks way better on highest settings...
ZONEofTECH that was a fast reply :D
ZONEofTECH i watched this on my s3 minii
ZONEofTECH Windows Phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH IPhone 4 s has better mic voice sounds more sexy
ZONEofTECH Omg dude Samsung is better
ZONEofTECH 5 megapixel just okay for me.. hehe
ZONEofTECH S3 mini is the best!!!
ZONEofTECH Dan is there a bug with the new starcraft to get random?
ZONEofTECH in hardware I will go for s3 mini
ZONEofTECH The ones that come with the iPhone and iPods are not. In ear  headphones with a rubber thing so they are fixed inside your ear.
ZONEofTECH Does the s3 mini lags :(( ????
ZONEofTECH but its like a rubber
ZONEofTECH Ryan boros thank you so much
ZONEofTECH No oled display....shit!!!!
ZONEofTECH what if your hands are dirty, or wet, or you dont want fingerprints, etc.
ZONEofTECH You might be waiting a while.
ZONEofTECH good review but all your screen boxes are very annoying... would slowly drain my life away from me... cant subscribe or I would obviously die
ZONEofTECH Of course a track phone hooked up to a car battery would be better than a iPhone iphones cant do anything
ZONEofTECH Smart Scroll does not detect the location of your eyes. all it does is notice that you are looking at the screen, and it begins to scroll when you tilt the phone up or down while looking at the screen.
ZONEofTECH Smart Scroll does not detect the location of your eyes. all it does is notice that you are looking at the screen, and it begins to scroll when you tilt the phone up or down while looking at the screen.
ZONEofTECH good but toooooo costly
ZONEofTECH does the Samsung galaxy s4 has Arabic keyboard ?
ZONEofTECH That friggin eye scroll thing got me.
ZONEofTECH THIS VIDEO IS OLD!  PLEASE CHECK OUT MY NEW VIDEO! youtube.comwatch?vbWTx04Ojy6o 1) New Samsung Galaxy S4 video!! 2) LIVE Release EVENT images! 3) TOP 10 SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 FEATURES! 4) OFFICIAL Galaxy S4 specs revealed by Samsung!
ZONEofTECH This is so cool but I just used my contract on my SG3
ZONEofTECH this is not how the real galaxy s4 looks,this video is out dated.....
ZONEofTECH Is it just me, or was this video made in iMovie...jussayin
ZONEofTECH VIVA la I Phone forever !Apple Mac I OS is the Bettler vwry Bettler system.I have two, the SGS3 and the IPHONE but I must say that the the I Phone is realy the best and only one phone etc. With all his systems,look and specs and and and....etc.
ZONEofTECH How wrong could you get.... I mean really.
ZONEofTECH it looks like the s3 no big difference
ZONEofTECH Really Disappointed with ZONEofTECH Sharing Wrong Information.. A Faggot LIAR.! i Click Unsubscribe and Click Dislike...never gonna watch your Videos again... 3:
ZONEofTECH So Samsung takes their existing s3 does the metal, does the performance upgrade, does the slightly bigger screen  fuck yeah win! So iphone does the metal back, does the performance upgrade, does the bigger screen.  fucking gay. Youtubers logic. Priceless..
ZONEofTECH Wait till he opens the box and finds out someone sent him his dead pet.
ZONEofTECH i want it for android
ZONEofTECH I am excited for the PS4 but still i do hope the Games start taking advantage of the Power of the system. Not Necessarily Graphics. But the ability to be able to do more within the Gameplay. What im seeing of the PS4 is giving me this impression but i do hope it follows through :)
ZONEofTECH they have the console they are just designing how it looks because it just a dull box now
ZONEofTECH Honestly, not impressed. Yes, its rendering a ton of stuff at any given time, but something very close to this can already be achieved using current gen systems and skilled developers. The really breath taking graphics will come later on the PS4 life cycle.
ZONEofTECH oh sweet jesus i need this now
ZONEofTECH Apple on twitter just blogged that the iWatch WILL be waterproof! (Tyler Eckert) it will have a special screen but not retina display, because it would take forever to make a waterproof retina display it seems pretty easy but its not. Its considered as a techy Smartwatch. Also ZoneOfTech It wont be charged by it self, it has a cable to be put in, so read more about it on twitter, facebook instagram and iNews . And also this video was made 3 month ago the talk about it was made 1 month ago!!
ZONEofTECH thanks for your info.
ZONEofTECH it might be slim and curvy
ZONEofTECH I think the iWatch will be purplr and shoot lazerz! :O
ZONEofTECH What. iPod touchs cant get Siri but this piece of shit can
ZONEofTECH I wear a gold Rolex watch that does exactly what I want it to do...tell me the time and the date and it looks good on my arm...another thing a watch should do. This thing looks like it should be free in a box of Cracker Jacks. So the answer to your question What will the iwatch be.....a disaster for Apple. I think I may unload a portion of my shares this week just watching this video. This is not Thinking Different it is not thinking at all.
ZONEofTECH It is going to look the sme as every thing else and I bet it will com with keyboard
ZONEofTECH awesome thats what it will be
ZONEofTECH Haha i do! Im just really busy with school and everything that i dont have the time to watch alot lol but good video!
ZONEofTECH I couldnt find the link containing the recmode 2.0. Could you tell me how to get it please

ZONEofTECH Hi, i have a macbook pro 13 (mid 2012) with Boot Camp Assistant ver. 4.0.4,. Now what version of Windows exactly can i install on it?
ZONEofTECH I tried it, but it says that it cant download because it is currently unavailable from the software update server. What should I do?
ZONEofTECH Goooooooooooooooooooooooood
ZONEofTECH Can I switch it back yo
ZONEofTECH I have a new imac and i want to run pc games. In the video, it says there are some requirements, but, for exemple, if i use 2gb ram, after can i use them for my mac? or only on windows?
ZONEofTECH i need windows 8 for my new apple mac book pro
ZONEofTECH ?????????????????????????????????
ZONEofTECH I want to get windows 8 because I want to use an original copy of windows
ZONEofTECH I really need this because i have windows 98 :(
ZONEofTECH i want to win windows 8 for back to school
ZONEofTECH That would be incredible if i won windows 8! I have been using Windows XP for years now and it is starting to burden me. My computer is sluggish. Heck the computers at my school are better than this! It would be a great help for both my computer and my schooling! Im planning on being a graphic designer but XP isnt cutting it! I dont have the money to just go and buy Windows 8 when i need it. You have some amazing videos. Good luck to you and whoever wins this in the future!
ZONEofTECH I want to win because my computer is just slow and defective and I feel that if a get this new highly talked about operating system that it should speed up operations on my computer. I really dont have the money right now either so this would help me out a lot. I also think your videos are of great information and help to the public being that they are free and cool thanks a lot!
ZONEofTECH i want win because i never use original copy of windows..
ZONEofTECH how do i download the windows support i want
ZONEofTECH Using Mac OS X Mountain Lion
ZONEofTECH did you download the iso file (windows 8) from torrent?
ZONEofTECH I am using Mac OSX Lion 10.7.5.
ZONEofTECH I have the ipad 5 ( air ) . So some of the informations are very wrong.
ZONEofTECH you mean iphone5. get your facts straight.
ZONEofTECH Is my time wrong or is that 7 months ago?
ZONEofTECH yea but apple hasnt even said anything 8
ZONEofTECH That month passes ssooo... Ya......
ZONEofTECH An expensive piece of junk.
ZONEofTECH um hey lets remember its april 2013. No iPad 5. dont belive the internet all the time
ZONEofTECH the ps4 is out in 2014 with the next xbox is out next year i dont think they will be released at the same time like the last gen the xbox 360 was released in 2005 wile ps3 was released a year later or two years if you lived i europe the one i dont want is another red or yellow light of death.
ZONEofTECH Soooool.... its the end of June now hahaha WRONG
ZONEofTECH They need to make the iPhone 5s a lil bigger like 4.5 or 4.7 inches
ZONEofTECH Clock is ticking dude, only 18 days left...
ZONEofTECH most likely 128 GB will be available for the iphone 5S
ZONEofTECH I think the iPhone 5S is gonna be the same sht as the iPhone 5
ZONEofTECH Shut up Jorge. Dont say that to another person. Dan is only speaking his opinion. What if he will do it? YOU will be held responsible. Damn people these days are fucking crazy. I cant believe no one else said this to you, but 17 other people liked what you said. You and all those are people are SICK.
ZONEofTECH So far, only iOS 7 has been revealed at the WWDC. I think maybe, theyre either gonna wait for next year for the 5s or release it at a sooner date of September
ZONEofTECH There is nothing to support the theory that iPhone 5S will be released at WWDC in June. In recent years WWDC has been a forum to introduce IOS upgrades and secondary consumer products. Following this trend it is more likely that they will keep to their Fall release format, especially considering we have a new body design that has been in the market for less than a year.
ZONEofTECH The icon is my favorite feature!
ZONEofTECH Ops, I forgot to mention this feature :( When you connect your iPhone to iTunes 11, an iPhone icon will appear in the TOP RIGHT CORNER. And by clicking that icon, you will be able to sync or iPhone as before.
ZONEofTECH How do you view album art, view your entire library of music, and see all of your play lists at once? the Previous iTunes could do that, this one looks like making playlists is tedious.
ZONEofTECH haha no problem, thanks! but in the last itunes i could just drag my music into my phone now i need to sync?
ZONEofTECH how do I pass the music yo my iPhone
ZONEofTECH Which MacBook Air are you planning to buy? Which configuration?
ZONEofTECH the thinness is very important for me but your suggestion is reasonable ill think over it.thank you very much
ZONEofTECH OSX 10.7 is amazing! I am quite happy with it.
ZONEofTECH I Have Mac OS X 10.8.2 On A Mid 2012 Mac Book Air Come on Apple Release Lynx!!!
ZONEofTECH im using mac osx 10.8.3 and would love to see Lynx when its out
ZONEofTECH even if the specs are far from what a pc today has doesnt mean it will be less powerful. consoles are static platforms and developers can precision tune their games to fully use what the consoles have, unlike the pc which forces developers to account for the trillions of hardware configuations. hell, when the 360 launched it could do everything a pc at the same time could graphically and even more in some cases. same thing will happen with next gen consoles which will catch up and surpass the pc
ZONEofTECH A 250GB PS3 Super Slim is 260 with uncharted 3, thats almost half the price of that PC. 240 buys a lot of games today. The 500 PC wont be that much more powerful than the PS3. With next gen theyre going to be more powerful than 20056 consoles, even cheap dual cores are more powerful than cell  the 360s triple core processor put together so the cpu business isnt really an issue. GPGPU will probably play a big part, CPUs dont need to be crazy beasts, just a jump from current gen.
ZONEofTECH Ps4 will have gpu of Radeon hd 7670 and Xbox will use 6670 hd basically the next gen Xbox is an update for the 360 really next ooook
ZONEofTECH Ahhhg blu ray :O finally better drives.
ZONEofTECH Ahhhg blu ray :O finally better drives.
ZONEofTECH So...theyre copying nintendos gamepad?
ZONEofTECH Blueray drive! No way! Blueray is from sony i will be surprised if that happens
ZONEofTECH xbox will have a bigger market share because of the fantastic opportunities and functionalities offered bt kinect which is currently unparalleled on the market.
ZONEofTECH buy it . worth the money
ZONEofTECH i found this 2 days before seeing this video.I hoper i can choose which rase i wan to be, not just random.......
ZONEofTECH My sc2, The random is locked but the zerg or proton is unlocked in custom game, haha epic glitch
ZONEofTECH Hey are there any similar glitches like this for the new patch since there is no more vs AI?
ZONEofTECH what do we do now cause sc2 changed what now?
ZONEofTECH i olsow had faind dis randomm:)
ZONEofTECH i use cheat and play protos and zerg but play with host zerg and protos too difficult and it is for old version i use my cheat new version
ZONEofTECH I really hope you get that video up soon! D:
ZONEofTECH how long is the Please wait while your build is being processed exploiting with limera1n cuz its been 10 mins
ZONEofTECH Filming with my iPad 3, editing in Final Cut Pro X, exporting in 1080 Full HD :)
ZONEofTECH I dont know :))) but yeah it is called a TV Ad :D Funny, I know
ZONEofTECH whats new with the camera?
ZONEofTECH good bye 500GB, Hello 3TB!
ZONEofTECH Guys, please LIKE and SHARE this videos so more people can see it. Thank you :D
ZONEofTECH Swipe right (or left  its one of those).
ZONEofTECH Okay cheers mate cuz im doing am early upgrade tomorrow and im new to the ios phones so would there be any point of upgradin to the fine or shouldni get the 4s ? Also does the 4s run on ios 7???
ZONEofTECH its not that google didnt make a new app. its that apple had control over the api and didnt want google to design it. they only paid google to use their services (same goes with the youtube app... hence why the new app is completely different from the one on previous iOS) i would like to add that the google maps api by apple was actually rushed out 1 week before the iphone was released apple apologized for their new maps, so i see no logic in you defending it, if apple themselves arent.
ZONEofTECH Its a shame for you not to make good money  when these regular students do it so easily. Go and Google Morsch Money Secret to see how they do it.
ZONEofTECH hey dude can you message me with that site you used to see what ppl make on tubes thanks
ZONEofTECH You guys should check out this EXTRAORDINARY website called ZONEPA.COM . You can make money online and start working from home today as I am! I am making over 3,000 per month at ZONEPA.COM ! Visit Zonepa.com and check it out! The seat demonstrates the talented limit. Why does the side service the cruel pull? How does the servant catalog the careful copy?
ZONEofTECH I want a 16gig so it will cost 250
ZONEofTECH Now I have something to countdown for
ZONEofTECH Sorry. The Iphone 5 has more RAM and the next generation processor thats twice as fast. The Ipod touch 5 is just a thinner iphone 4s without the phone ability and it has IOS 6.
ZONEofTECH Yeah, most of the ipod fans want this because of siri..is a feature in the 5g
ZONEofTECH for fuck sake i have to wait till the 25th of december (christmas):(:(:(:(:(:(:(
ZONEofTECH SO CORRECT!!! i preordered it on the 14 of september
ZONEofTECH Thank you. I really want this now :) you just earned apple 300 more lol
ZONEofTECH pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaase tell me how your getting it in two days i cant get mine until october pleasseee help
ZONEofTECH can you listen to music without earbuds?
ZONEofTECH This video is not true, before the iPhone exist other smarthphones had the same style, so please tell me another design for touch smartphones? An triangular smartphone, or circular smartphone, this video has no sense, remember the palms we can say that the iPhone is a totally copy of a palm, and the same samsung conector its similar to the apples conector is because samsung has worked with apple in the past years. The nexus S is not a Samsung phone, dont be a fucking apple fanboy.
ZONEofTECH you cant invent the wheel twice
ZONEofTECH You seem uneducated. Are you?
ZONEofTECH Finally someone with a solid argument and well put together video. There is NO doubt that Samsung and others completely ripped Apple off for nothing more than financial gain. What happened to innovation? Microsoft is even innovating now. Good for them. No one wants to see a company have a monopoly on tech but if you just steal other ideas instead of doing your own Research and Development... sure youll save money... but then again... you might get embarrassed in court.
ZONEofTECH wird, i get a samsung sd card with it
ZONEofTECH your paying 200 more to not the a small pixel up very close
ZONEofTECH Im getting one on my birthday this February!!! Yay!!!!! Should I get black or white.. Give me good responds please!!!!!!!!!!!! Im despret!
ZONEofTECH Its just a phone... lol begining
ZONEofTECH With what did you record this video?
ZONEofTECH Tell me why Im watching this
ZONEofTECH I want the 3gs for mmy birrhday
ZONEofTECH wow he really loves the box doesnt he xD
ZONEofTECH Who Want the iPhone 3GS or iPhone 4G or even 4S this Smart Phones has Gone! I love to see people get the latest New Powerful SmartPhones because Camera, face camera Lovely, performance  New Apps New Programs!
ZONEofTECH Daniel would you mind making a video of mac vs windows or somethin like that please, i really wanna watch that!
ZONEofTECH Man I remember seeing this when it came out back then. I had a motorolla razor phone and really wanted this one but was stuck until I was due for an upgrade and I have the iphone 4 32gb now. I was so jealous that everyone had an iphone but me. But I am so happy I finally have one :)
ZONEofTECH He really loves the box so much :)
ZONEofTECH Hmm...its working for me, on 10.8.2. Just reboot after enabling it and you should be OK.
ZONEofTECH I thought that SSDs that have a SandForce controller dont need TRIM enabled on OS X, and that even it is a bad idea to enable it, is this wrong and why?
ZONEofTECH 1) move trim enabler to your desktop 2) open terminal and write the following: chmod x Trim Enabler 3)try it now, if it doesnt work contact me again if it does please SUBSCRIBE :)
ZONEofTECH hey guys this didnt work on a 21.5 mid 2010 iMac with Mountain Lion with an Intel 520 Series 240 gb SSD i dont know what to do, can you help me?
ZONEofTECH Hi, Im from Switerland and I have a Macbook Pro 13, mi2010, with MAC OS X 10.8.4, a Kingston 120GB SSD and it works fine !! Thanks a lot for your video, its very nice job and so easy to understand :) (sorry for my english )
ZONEofTECH Are you going to do a give away of your iPhone 3G I currently dont have a phone and Im 15
ZONEofTECH Have you got iPhone 5 I am getting one on my birthday
ZONEofTECH Yeah, my dog likes to fly it from time to time. Its pretty annoying to have just 1 plane for the entire family...A week ago he took his puppies to Australia and he wasnt back until 2 days ago...
ZONEofTECH Hello I am getting a iPhone 3g and my moms coworker is giving to me I need to know the specific details of how it works and how you can keep it for a really long time
ZONEofTECH This is going to be my first iPhone. XD My dad will get me a better one at the end of the year if I dont break it.
ZONEofTECH dat helt me a lot because the iphone so stupid wid itunes
ZONEofTECH Great video! Upgrading to an SSD was the best move I ever madeespecially because I dual boot.One strange thing: I back up to a 5400 RPM 1TB SeaGate GoFlex HDD over 2x faster than your internal hard drive, and thats via Firewire 800. It doesnt make sense.
ZONEofTECH This is soooooo old lol
ZONEofTECH what kind of problems do you have?
ZONEofTECH idk if you know but mcbooks are too weak to get the full power of the ssd haha bottleneck
ZONEofTECH Yes, definitely. Ditch that shit. The 2013 MacBook air is waaaaay more powerful than the 2011 Pro. Both in CPU and Graphics performance. Not to mention the thinner design and 18h battery.
ZONEofTECH The video really helped a lot. I installed new RAM and an SSD onto my MacbookPro 2011. I especially liked how you showed us how to update via wifi. Thanks
ZONEofTECH Thx :D Worked really hard on making his come true. !Just for you guys to know, this is actually my 2nd upgrade video. The 1st one was done without a tripod, had almost no lighting at all and was unprofessional. So yeah, I reinstalled my old HDD and RAM just to make this video. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH If I put this os on a computer that I sell that I use a pre purchased code, that I use on my computer, is their a way for them to hack into my computer? Thanks
ZONEofTECH The aaaa... SAME GOES FOR THE TOP!!!
ZONEofTECH Where can I get one brand new ?
ZONEofTECH I had this last year. It lasted 9 months, first the light went out, then the fan stopped working. But all in all it worked very well, plus I got it off eBay for 67 with bucks (Free shipping).
ZONEofTECH how loud is the noise in dB (decibel)?
ZONEofTECH uhhm, i have got a laptop (hp probook 4740s) and i have never played any games before, so i want this coolpad, does it keep my laptop cool if i play heavy games like gta5? because heating affects the performance of my laptop.
ZONEofTECH Do you have a website I could buy this from? I cant seem to find it anywhere?
ZONEofTECH Thx for your support :D I would really appreciate it if you subscribed to my channel for more awsome! videos :D Cheers Dashional!
TopGear AHHHHHHHH!!!!!! CANT WAIT
retrogametech GreenJanuary Yeah Im a big fan too, lol. It was a great show. I traveled all the way down from Scotland just to see them. The show is based on them doing community service. So instead of jail they have to travel around doing anti drug and alcohol shows. It was really funny.

screenjunkies thats one of the pet peeves i have of his videos... doing the voice over things when he cant change his voice.. but he does have great toys and reviews. and im prettyjealous he got on the toy review videos first cuz i would love to do what he does. also... his apartment looks way too crowded... he needs to get a bigger place for all his toys! happy birthday sean and loved this Jon!
screenjunkies The voice that never hit puberty
screenjunkies I liked him waayy back when Transformer reviews were really hot on the scene about 2008. Since then he has just gotten really annoying and repetittive. But I have to say, hes come a long way since then, so good for him!
screenjunkies Sean long does good reviews hes lol to
screenjunkies Hilarious, man! But one has to wonder why you didnt bring up buhtins and horrible singing...

screenjunkies Where do you most get on Vince Vaughns nerve? Right here, Vince Vaughn Googles Himself! where he is looking offscreen at his agentmanager trying to feel when how to get your ass yanked.
screenjunkies Something funny hey, Vince likes Mince
screenjunkies When you waved goodbye at the end you reminded me of the retarded policeman...
screenjunkies M night shamalanadingdong!!
screenjunkies Happy Birthday (belated) Joe. I had 2 miss the live broadcast 4 work but ill catch it on iTunes this wknd. I hope u had a good time. C U  the movies. L8r
screenjunkies Most of the action sequences in FF, for that matter other car chase movie, are filmed at lower speeds. Then they dub in more engine noise in post production. The opening scene of the first FF movie , where they were hijacking the truck is pure Hollywood.
screenjunkies Turns out I cant afford to be fast.. and that makes me FUURRIOUS!!! LMFAO
screenjunkies Find someone less annoying than this guy to do the videos. Honest trailers is a 9.610. This guys video is a 2.410
screenjunkies Hey Hal, I like to watch your mom
screenjunkies You are not funny which makes me wonder why your honest trailers are!
screenjunkies I thought this would be a group of physicists completely deconstructing the immense stupidity and absolute ignorance of the laws of physics displayed in the movie. If that is not a thing yet, that needs to be a thing. Somewhere.
screenjunkies Ok, those tshirts suck.
screenjunkies I cannot disagree with Hugh Jackman as Picard. Hes the only character who would have that warmth that Patrick Stewart brought to the role. Of the three, Hughs the only one I can see saying, Make it so, in a manner similar to Patricks
screenjunkies Question: Why would they reboot this? Why would anyone be interested in seeing a reboot, other than some douchie little trekkers?
screenjunkies firefly!!! Just bring it back!
screenjunkies Although I think its good that they give their own dream cast (which is basically just their opinion), I quite disagree with who theyre picking.Dont get me wrong, the actors they chose are good actors, but..To me, the cast or TNG was quite young.. I dont know the real ages of the actors who played Data or Geordi or anyone else when they were in TNG, but they all look around twenty to thirty years old. (Except Picard ofcourse) I hope that IF they reboot TNG, they pick young looking actors and put A LOT of effort into it. Go big or go home. You know that if you dont do it good, youll get hate from the fandoms :(I came across a good example of an actor who could play Data, Tom Hiddleston. If you look it up on Google youll find some photoshopped pictures of Tom as Data and they look quite good to me :)
screenjunkies In a few years perhaps they can do the original cast of this and any other remake of any kind, as utterly flawlessly realistic computer generated characters, so still Bil Shatner or Patrick Stewart, or even the late DeForest Kelley and (pardon my forgetfullness whoever played the original Scotty)
screenjunkies just recast the office as the cast of the next gen crew
screenjunkies worf doesnt need to be black
screenjunkies Please make this happen
screenjunkies i dont like jj abrams stuff id rather make it myself
screenjunkies Why must everything good be fucked up??? There already is a Star Trek The Next Generation, just leave it alone. They have already destroyed Star Wars and V, could you at least leave us TNG???
screenjunkies If its always to see anyone full retard, its just disheartening to see some of your favorite entertainers go FULL retard.
screenjunkies Now I HAVE to go donate to Zach whom I love as an actor and his last movie (even though it was hard to find), discouraging people to donate to anything they like is fucking stupid. Theres a reason in 10 days youve only made about 700, this is such a juvenile use of Kickstarter. I dont care how rich he is, this is more than asking for money, hes trying to establish an audience that is actually invested emotionally and monetarily in what hes doing.
screenjunkies ScreenJunkies has been at 656 for TEN DAYS!! Zach Braff made 1.5 million dollars in a few!
screenjunkies Looking at how the Dont back Zach campaign is going, it looks like people have already spoken. Sorry Screen junkies just because someone has a ton of money doesnt mean that they should use all their money before finding a backer for their next project.
screenjunkies Looking at how the Dont back Zach campaign is going, it looks like people have already spoken. Sorry Screen junkies just because someone has a ton of money doesnt mean that they should use all their money before finding a backer for their next project.
screenjunkies Ye, cos obviously people want to donate their money for a joke.... Mabey I should give my life savings to my mate, uno...for the lols
screenjunkies I dont get why people dont understand this. Just because he is worth 22 million, doesnt mean he has that much liquid cash in the bank! Net worth includes the value of his possessions, including a house, car, any stocks etc. Just because he has 22 mill net worth doesnt mean he can spare around 6 million for the movie. He already stated he is using a lot of his own cash for it. And clearly he felt that whatever his pocket could afford wasnt enough, so he is getting more cash from kickstarter
screenjunkies Hello Zach Braff on an alternate youtube account you made with a picture of some douche from a cheap wallet insert.
screenjunkies So let me get this straight, you are shamelessly collecting money from people to stop people from shamelessly collecting money from people? Wow.
screenjunkies CUDDLEFISH!! ( south park )
screenjunkies i want someone to make a reaction video to her reation.
screenjunkies The most awkward and disturbing film Ive ever watched with my parents is Happiness by Todd Solondz. The film deals with rape, murder, depression, suicide, domestic violence, paedophilia, masturbation, cumshots, a pervert making obscene phone calls to random women, and some of the most awkward and just plain wrong fatherson conversations imaginable, and it passes as a comedy, albeit extremely dark. It was an interesting experience watching it with my parents.
screenjunkies Youre blurring the best part
screenjunkies hahah! your mom is so cute! i love how she covers your eyes and says, dont watch that, i couldnt stop laughing.XD
screenjunkies i love shlinders list
screenjunkies She sounds like Carls mum from South Park
screenjunkies Its so weird to watch this with the benefit of hindsight. Not many of their predictions proved correct. It seems Summer 2013 was a pretty big surprise to them all.
screenjunkies PACIFIC RIM way underated
screenjunkies You cant call Lone Ranger a family movie  unless you have major money to pay for therapy! The movie opens with the villain punching a guy in the chest, pulling out his heart, and then eating it! Any sane parents would join the mass exodus from the theater immediately after the first scene and line up for a refund of the ticket price. Seriously, what was your childhood like if you believe THAT is a good family movie?! You have my pity.
screenjunkies Pacific Rim was the best. Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 tied at two for me.
screenjunkies despicable me 2 beat monsters university the lone ranger and it was the number 1 movie in the world but iron man was only 1 movie in America and I think man of steel beat 10 times better than iron man 3
screenjunkies Wow really?Man of Steel was Great and The Wolverine was emo.????
screenjunkies I hate all these people sometimes.Sometimes I dont mind them
screenjunkies Into darkness has made 430 million worldwide I dont think it struggled at all
screenjunkies Can we have a follow up of this video?
screenjunkies Mark Whalberg looks like he wants to punch him. Haha
screenjunkies So youre sending Nick to meet The Rock eh? Oh God! I can only imagine the length of the restraining order.
screenjunkies Yeah this was pretty fun when Farley did this 20 years ago.
screenjunkies Incredible experiencia with The Rock, so awesome!
screenjunkies i will flip my shit if i ever met Steven Spielberg, that guy made my favorite movies of all time
screenjunkies Poor mark wahlberg nick mundy completely dissed him...
screenjunkies with the like going out and in they make it seem like hours even though it might have been like a few minutes lol
screenjunkies Liam neeson. Just saw his last film NonStop and ive been a fan of him since phantom menace. QUI GON JINN IS MY HERO!!!
screenjunkies i was hoping this was going to be funny. I am dissapoint.
screenjunkies faz dos les miserables
screenjunkies hmmm, nao gosta de ser criticado... vc pode comentar o que vc quiser, a internet  livre, dessa forma tb posso te criticar qdo eu quiser.
screenjunkies as gemeas olsen, o nick fury com dois olhoskkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies Cara Jeff Goldblum pegou Laura Dern depois desse filme ! Ele tem meu respeito !
screenjunkies What is it about the good guys in T.V. shows being amongst the most excruciatingly boring, humourless, dull and dreary of all?...Watching (enduring) Rob Stark and John Snow is like succumbing to carbon monoxide poisoning  colourless, tasteless, odourless (well, 2 out of 3 aint bad) but anaesthetising to say the least. Then we have Sheriff Rick Grimes of The Walking Dead  boringno sense of humour whatsoever, followed by Dexter Morgan, the majority of superheroes  apart from perhaps Ironman, Hancock and that Green Lantern guy.

screenjunkies BrBa: UV Blue Raspberry vodka  with a little lemon seltzer to get the right crystal blue color  and not to be drinking straight vodka. Garnish with crystal blue rock candy. This was my BrBa night drink for many episodes.
screenjunkies i tried the big bang theory drinking game you drink for every laugh track had to get my stomach pumped after 5 mins
screenjunkies It should have been every time Jesse says bitch and everytime you see a boob on game of thrones
screenjunkies One show inspired its own: Supernatural: purple nurples! Not sure whats in it, but theres a drinking game too.
screenjunkies sorry but your wrong about the irish were terrible drivers not terrible drinkers

screenjunkies Watch Harry Potter and take a drink of a combination of cream soda and butterscotch shnops (butter beer) every time Ron makes a funnyweird face.
screenjunkies Everybody says that. Give me 3 reasons to start watching that show. Dont worry Ill wait......
screenjunkies I think Obama is to America what the prequels are to Star Wars. Unneeded, dumb, overrated, and complete bad decisions. Also his foreign policy is like jar jar binks...
screenjunkies Obama just wants to combine his favorite Scifi series, and create peace between them.
screenjunkies People that call themselves nerds are just people trying to be idiots in act like they know everything about comic books and everything to know about superheroes so if you are a nerd out there dont call your self one because that word is the word that is used by bullies Bullies call people nerdsBecause nowadays people that call themselves nerds wear shirts that say nerd on them they wear shirts that say geek on them I when I go and ask them questions about comic books they dont even know what a comic book isI love comic books and people act like they love comic books ruins everything they have never not once went to a super con or Comic Con so if you see somebody Thats says they are a nerd ask them a super hero question. People that call themselves nerds are not nerds Thank you and best regards
screenjunkies Im English and I still prefer the U.S. office :)
screenjunkies May the force ever be in you favor Mr Potter!  Gandlaf (The Chronicles of Narnia)
screenjunkies Why is everyone saying Beam me up, Skywalker. ITS SKYPOTTER GODAMMIT.
screenjunkies Thats exactly how he has this country on a mind melt Jedi trick for kids
screenjunkies The question: I like to call it comicon.
screenjunkies WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL.
screenjunkies I love how the Bellas father is totally oblivious to everything going on. Isnt she still a teenager? He must be the least engaged parent of all time.
screenjunkies I fucking lost it when he said Skeletor! XD
screenjunkies THANK GOD ITS OVER!!! srsly, shovel face is the shittiest actor ever.
screenjunkies Ghost can kick Jacobs ass
screenjunkies Taylor Swift so amazing hahaha
screenjunkies I saw this movie yeaterday, the part 2 and I cannot understand why this movies were  are so popular. I really dont get it : anand yes, during the movie I was thinking Shovelface... Shovelface....
screenjunkies Im the same way! Shovelface and mouth breather... I burst out laughing every time I hear it. Awesome.
screenjunkies OMG OMG OMG OMG, WOW, such GREAT ACTING. Such WELL THOUGHT OUT STARES. SO MUCH EMOTIONS I CAN TASTE IT. So fucking perfectly scripted and amazing I just wanna put a bullet in my head. Cause, ya know, its JUST THAT GOOD. SO GOOD I CANT EVEN HANDLE IT. BELLA SWAN IS THE MOST WELL THOUGHT OUT CHARACTER EVER CONCEIVED. Seriously. She has no personality of her own so her beautiful young fans can put themselves in her bland shoes satchels herself on SO LOVINGLY to any dude that returns her stares, is willing to date a 109 year old pedophile stalker BECAUSE SHES JUST SO LOVING, and is willing to carry a vampire demon spawn baby to full term.... BECAUSE LOVE. WHAT A DECENT HUMAN BEING. I HOPE I HAVE A DAUGHTER JUST LIKE HER.
screenjunkies OK I love the channel but I hope I never become bored enough to sit though this.Me bounce now.
screenjunkies Thousands of preteens and lonely mothers wasted 26 minutes of their lives watching people stare at each other.
screenjunkies wow, nearly 30 mins of just stares!!! why do some people like these movies?
screenjunkies Its funny how all the stare scenes mashed together is better then the actual movie.
screenjunkies 3 minutes was enough for me...
screenjunkies I got past the first movie onto the seocond . why am I doing this im so not going to be able to watch much longer :P lasted 02:15
screenjunkies I gave up at the 2 minute mark......
screenjunkies wut? a drinking game that requires you drink whenever the main character appears? dude you just want to drink the hell out, dontcha?
screenjunkies I want Matt Damon to host
screenjunkies Funny that Hal said We want more Ben Affleck, considering the controversy over Batfleck... just interesting.
screenjunkies My dream host would be Robert Downey jr as Kirk Lazarus from tropic thunder!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Andy Serkis as Golum and Caesar and whoever else.
screenjunkies Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman
screenjunkies I hate Seth macfarlane
screenjunkies SACHA BARON COHEN!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Ellen DeGeneres is actually hosting the 2014 Oscars :D Im so excited!!!
screenjunkies First class is the best Xmen by far
screenjunkies Id like to see Batman and Darkwing Duck battle together.
screenjunkies I agree, too many movies are based on Wolverine... we need a new set of characters. And fix Deadpool, because I LOVE Deadpool, and he looks worse then the Green Lanterns Movie SGI Suit
screenjunkies If Deadpool looked like Deadpool that would be nice
screenjunkies Avengers vs XMen. That was a great story and it could be its own trilogy. Imagine all the fight scenes and how the character from all the movies would interact.
screenjunkies I think it will be good
screenjunkies Whoa, back up, Fantastic Four reboot?
screenjunkies Alison!!! Welcome back! Miss you from g4!!!! Ah the good ol days.
screenjunkies They are gonna fuck this up.
screenjunkies And back to the future
screenjunkies The girl in the red dress what is here name  phone numberP.S I am not a weird or anything
screenjunkies I recognized terminator and Star Wars
screenjunkies How did she not know about Back to the future its one of my favoriot movies of all time and who cares about the creepy relationship between Marty and his mam its all about the time travel and awesomeness
screenjunkies whats up with Brenna and the Amish haystack hairdo?
screenjunkies They dont know Star Wars, Peter Gabriel and Back to the Future? The fuck.
screenjunkies it was still not a make out scene, I kiss my mom and sisters like that
screenjunkies Could you have picked up worse women than these?
screenjunkies the part where beyonce powered up beyond the level of super sayian
screenjunkies Chuck norris standing in the middle of the field
screenjunkies Tu pac hologram halftime show
screenjunkies Best Super Bowl halftime would be watching Adam Sandler dress up like ghost rider while the rock and Liam Neeson try and stop him.
screenjunkies Best show would be a live reinactment of dark knight rises with Tom hardy playing bane
screenjunkies please do an honest trailer for battleship. the only alien invasion movie I ever saw in which I rooted for the aliens to win
screenjunkies Best half time show? Obviously Morgan freeman reading random notes
screenjunkies Wow, these women are real tarts.
screenjunkies Now I want some chipotle! Thanks Hal. Bye Bye!
screenjunkies Lolololol! The blonde witch is simply saying in (modern) Greek, My Hermes, give me a parking spot, keep it empty for me. Lets not even go into the fact that Hermes was never seen as a deity which was in any way concerned with spaces (and I dont think the messenger of Zeus would give much of a fck), but why is there not even an effort to try to use some classical Greek in there...
screenjunkies at 3:40, she had to think about her answer and she looked away from him while answering. Conclusion: she eats children.
screenjunkies wait, your a fucking dick?
screenjunkies I was waiting for him to bring up Harry Potter.
screenjunkies come on! real witches? thats like saying real vampires, or real undead
screenjunkies ok wtf ? :P this chick just said give me a parking spot and keep it clear for me in greek ... :P :P hell of a witch :P
screenjunkies That fat one totally eats children.
screenjunkies DUPSTEP KILLS ZOMBIES
screenjunkies How can people question whether this is serious? Obviously its a joke .
screenjunkies id like to touch her boobs
screenjunkies I would struggle him with that ugly tshirt of screen junkies. I still like your show though
screenjunkies Why kill the zombie? Just give them a hug! :D
screenjunkies Spikes baseball bat (iron one)
screenjunkies Make them listen to every justin beiber song that ever came out over and over and over and over
screenjunkies Best way to kill a zombie is with a Dog
screenjunkies Have yas done twilight?
screenjunkies Whats offensive? I saw the movie and liked it, they didnt go after white guys, they were people with bounties on their heads whose deaths were permitted by the state (except for when Djangos professor friend whatshisname shoots so and so which causes the tete a tete towards the end). Its a movie about people in strange situations making a living, Django just happened to be a freed slave. All this is is pussification of the public. Kids used to play with cowboy toys, now were being told that anything that references vigilantism in the past is offensive. How about we just all act like adults and not ban any toys unless theyre meant for little kids and contain little parts they could swallow and stop caring about what is and isnt PC?Also, I am trying to come up with an answer but I think you nailed it with Human Centipede action figures.
screenjunkies I cracked up when that dude was like Good name
screenjunkies Woody Harrelson action figure from Natural Born Killers.
screenjunkies Dragon Tattoo Trilogy, Clockwork Orange, Silence of the Lambs, and The Shining...
screenjunkies anything with Anne Frank or Hellen Keller xD
screenjunkies Waynes World. No wait that would be pretty awesome.
screenjunkies Schindlers list action figures...... that would turn some heads!!
screenjunkies KKKKKKK testuda! Como de costume, tima legendagem.
screenjunkies Nick Mundy really annoys me. He always just takes a deep breath and starts shouting, Awesome. How about you calm down a little and say something meaningful?
screenjunkies Cloud Atlas was great. Just gotta look at it at more than face value. (Plus Bae Doona was awesome but totally overlooked cause no one knew her.)
screenjunkies thousand words was a great movie I loved that movie it made laugh cry
screenjunkies Santa is in charge of the razzies?
screenjunkies Too short. Felt like it could have been longer, or was and is the victim of the editing room floor.
screenjunkies anyone who thinks robert pattinson is a bad actor should watch how to deal.
screenjunkies shit in the ice cream hahahaaaa
screenjunkies Cloud Atlas was a terrible movie.
screenjunkies Id like to see less Super Hero movies. Seriously, EVERY SINGLE comic book character doesnt need a freaking reboot. Am I the only one here who thinks that Genre has been totally played out? It was a good run while it lasted but now its just tired and annoying. Lets take a step back and move on to something else.
screenjunkies Your Junk talks? OMG!
screenjunkies Grow your hair out!!!! XD
screenjunkies the new die hard is called die hardest
screenjunkies If they decide to make more Die Hard movies they should stick to basics as fatty boy here said, and quit putting John McClane in ridiculous situations. They should follow Die Hard ones storyline where at first McClane wasnt a happy triger, and they could start by following his carrer from patrolman to detective and romancing Holly Gennaro. Die Hard must not be turned into a crappy summer blockbuster attempt, holding a good plot will have us series fans happy and paying for movie tickets.
screenjunkies It should be called Die Hard of Natural Causes.
screenjunkies A love NICK MUNDY. He is pure entertainment.
screenjunkies Just fking Die Already You fking cts!!!!
screenjunkies Underneath all your yelling and rage and fuck, you forgot to add one of the best elements of Die Hard 1 and 2, make it Christmas time again! 1. Make it Christmas Eve again. 2. Make it R rated. 3. Have a great bad villain. 4. Confine John McClane to a particular spaced area, like a building or an airport. 5. Stop making Die Hard look like an ordinary modern action flick, take to back to its classic look and sound.
screenjunkies What the fuck??!! Is he peeing fire at 2:13?!
screenjunkies I was searching for the worst movies of 2012, but this is hilarious!
screenjunkies and it was pretty funny when data got his head ripped off
screenjunkies Aww they left out Russle Crowes credibility in the in memoriam
screenjunkies John Travoltas dignity . . . amen to that.
screenjunkies i want your Ghostbusters stuff !!!!!!
screenjunkies This guy reminds me of the comic book shop owner from big bang theory. I think his name is stuart.
screenjunkies travolta lost his dignity years ago hairspray.
screenjunkies I actually really enjoyed and liked john carter...
screenjunkies Game of Thrones super spoiler!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies pelo menos dos livros, dos filmes eu tenho um milho de coisas  dizer.
screenjunkies Uma aventura onde cada personagem principal enfrenta constantes perigos mortais, mas s o Sean Bean morre KKKKKKKKKKKKK
screenjunkies Please please please do Total Recall !!!!!
screenjunkies Aposto que quando chega um novo roteiro nas mos do Sean Bean, ele j pergunta: Do que meu personagem vai morrer dessa vez?. kkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies Lindsay Lohan... Huhauhauhauhauha
screenjunkies Bundiario de princesa.kkkk
screenjunkies Achei que tinha parado  boa traduo
screenjunkies Ah pelamor. Eu particularmente gosto mais do the Dark Knight do que do Titanic, mas o James Cameron desenvolveu seus personagens em Titanic em 195 min melhor do que o Nolan fez em uma trilogia. A mesma coisa Coppola e seu godfather. E estou falando isso como um f de Nolan. Meu filme preferido da trilogia do batman do Nolan  o The Dark Knight, mas o roteiro mais bem escrito e enxuto  sem sombra de dvidas o menos adorado: o de Batman Begins.
screenjunkies Walken is Data, no makeup or contacts.
screenjunkies Leslie Mann was way too exited this whole time.
screenjunkies I love how Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann both had very different reactions to the waxing.
screenjunkies Paul needs to up his waxing skillz, he waxed the wrong way!
screenjunkies i want a tee shirt maaaan
screenjunkies TNG Alex Borstein, using Lois Griffins voiv

screenjunkies how the Grinch stole hanukka
screenjunkies i think weve seen enough jews...
screenjunkies Good idea, terrible jokes, direction, acting. Sell the idea to Sacha Baron Cohen and he will make it as it should be
screenjunkies They arrested Superman for being an illegal alien
screenjunkies Too bad you couldnt get Jerry Lewis to play the dad. :)
screenjunkies I dont get why everyone is bitching about this, they were just having fun...its not like they actuely hate jews.
screenjunkies KKKKKKKKKKK sou f e levei numa boa, tem cada coisa tonta ai euri
screenjunkies Dat little Yoshi plushie strapped to the guy in the Mario costume. XDAlso I rofled when the Stormtroopers always miss. came up.
screenjunkies Darth Nihilus is somewhere over there.
screenjunkies black mario,twenty sided die? this is epic.
screenjunkies From now on, all sports should have the Power Play rule. Seriously.
screenjunkies I want to put babies in that Radical Edward cosplayer. Rawr!
screenjunkies Adding this to my bucket list.
screenjunkies I could NOT spend a whole day in the hostrs company. That fucking voice.
screenjunkies OMG this is soo epic!! O
screenjunkies I dont get it? Hal rudnick is Awesome!
screenjunkies Awww, this makes me want to spam you...with love!
screenjunkies No comments... only trailers and thats all. Any thing else you do sucks. Stick to trailers
screenjunkies These jokes really are Goering too far.
screenjunkies dude hal is the funniest guy ever!!!!
screenjunkies really? he does have a comical head thats for sure.
screenjunkies Haha! You are funny dude, I dont get whats wrong with those people
screenjunkies Hahaha I love this guy!
screenjunkies Wow you should do the trailer! haha not seen the film yet but I have heard a lot of people say the same thing.
screenjunkies Sarah looked pissed, when the other 2 got tickets xD
screenjunkies My daughter wanted me to take her to one of these films and stand in line with other loser father and their little shts... I just laughed in her face. Ahhh, good times with the family.
screenjunkies These girls are so spoiled!
screenjunkies i feel bad for their dad :(
screenjunkies And that is the story of why Sarah was brutally murdered that night.
screenjunkies Awesome. So happy they all got to go to see the really terrible movie and all their dreams came true.
screenjunkies The only actor I was happy to see was Jackson Rathbone. Even Ill admit hes awesome, even if hes in this shit.
screenjunkies yeah twilight is fucking dumb but THIS is horribly cynical
screenjunkies The Walking Dead  every time a walker is killed xD
screenjunkies Holy shit, was that the actual guy who played Jack Sparrow?
screenjunkies Disneys Star Wars Auditions!
screenjunkies GEORGE......................................................................................WHY ???
screenjunkies walking dead simple do one shot after they kill a zombie
screenjunkies New Total Recall, lens flare drinking game. Youll be mashed after 20mins.
screenjunkies in walking dead everytime a gun is shot by the slide doesnt go back...wait....ya you would probably die of alcohol poisoning.
screenjunkies Kristen Stewart should play Ior if they ever make a live action winnie the pooh movie.
screenjunkies eyor was the perfect obi
screenjunkies 3:30 dont think , just do it  did you switch from jedi to arnold Schwarzenegger there? lol
screenjunkies You guys are complete losers, that is not a prank, that is harassment. SOOOO unsubscribing.
screenjunkies Those werent even funny pranks. I love pranks, and this made me sad.
screenjunkies not funny at all,lame lame lame!
screenjunkies This is supposod to be fun???? BOOOOOORING!!!!
screenjunkies Two things. 1. Theyre really ballsy. 2. That brother line cracked me up.
screenjunkies these are not the assholes you are looking for
screenjunkies That was just about the lamest pranking I have ever seen. Not funny and just wayyyyy too in your face. Stealing hats, phones and sexual harassment isnt funny. They are actually petty crimes. I dont care if you come back with it later, you and your friend are probably going to get thrown into moving traffic if you try something like that on me. Thats why other pranksters use their friends and setups and just watch peoples reactions. Bleh.
screenjunkies By Black you mean no spirit of black people. Lol
screenjunkies Hello the voice was a freaking dog bark
screenjunkies BIXBY also whats the name of the last some with the cowbells?
screenjunkies They actually got the ghost of Bill Bixby
screenjunkies its funny that you conjured Bill Bixby, considering in the 1976 he played a spiritualist, in The Great Houdini, that was getting a message from Harry Houdini to give to his wife Bess Houdini.
screenjunkies Hal looks like a fat iron man
screenjunkies i agree but can u though i a joker joke about how he wasnt in the movie like he had a cold or something
screenjunkies I think they said we love boobs
screenjunkies oh man that kid is going to be a nightmare when her 15 mins is up.
screenjunkies Were everyday people. Thats actually scarier.
screenjunkies Jeezuuz that girl was fucking rude!WHAT A BITCH!
screenjunkies thats so sad, hating a small child :(
screenjunkies This family is every thing wrong with Americans
screenjunkies That child pisses me off
screenjunkies id rather go back in time and kill honey boo boo
screenjunkies its people like these that made them WANT to 911 us
screenjunkies This is really funny!!
screenjunkies I dont like you. I dont like your show. .... So yeah.
screenjunkies Only Christopher Walken could make this disgusting show the slightest bit interesting!
screenjunkies Walken brings a certain panache if you will to the words of Honey Boo Boo.
screenjunkies Christopher Walken Reads Honey Boo Boo!
screenjunkies WALKIE WALK BEAR. Omgsh thats so adorable X.
screenjunkies Nope, it actually seems that I am intellectually superior to you, seeing as how you just insult and ask a rhetorical question without backing it up. Apparently having your own opinions on something isnt the right way to live where you come from. Love and Live on my friend,
screenjunkies a heart attack waiting to happen
screenjunkies hello Jovem Nerd foi a melhor parte!!! NerdPower

screenjunkies Gostei da legenda, s tem que tomar um cuidado extra com erros de gramtica comuns, no caso, concertando, o correto seria com s, instantneamente no tem o acento, enfim, coisas bobas. No mais, parabns pelo trabalho.
screenjunkies It would be funny if it werent real:http:www.unodc.orgdocumentshumantraffickingUNVTFfsHTEN.pdf
screenjunkies cant stop laughing! XD
screenjunkies Taken was great but Taken 2 made it feel like just another action movie, and they just showed the same landmark in that movie over and over because it was the only famous one there, they should of picked a better place to shoot the movie.
screenjunkies Cmon!! You make this video  havent done an honest trailer of Taken 2?!!!
screenjunkies D OMG thats fucking epic !
screenjunkies I laughed so hard at Officer Burke..
screenjunkies Holy shit did he just interview Saddam Hussien?!!!
screenjunkies Oddly enough, I wouldve seen this.
screenjunkies Disneys Looper from 1994
screenjunkies Wonder if they would end this with a blunderbuss to the chest.
screenjunkies lol they made a movie this year called lopper that has the same to people in it
screenjunkies doesnt the young kid and adult guy try to kill each other? no seriously. its liek hollywood is so bad, they need to recycle EVERYTHING
screenjunkies Wait a second joseph gordonlevitt was the kid in angels in the outfield???? MIND BLOWN!!!!!!!! THAT WAS MY FAVORITE BASEBALL MOVIE AS A KID!!!!
screenjunkies I remember this movie
screenjunkies Theyre mostly known for encouraging people to go see 300 and scream This is Sparta when Leonidas kicks the messenger on the well. Other moviegoers must have enjoyed it.
screenjunkies Maybe you should have interviewed people who could actually come up with some form of intelligent criticism.
screenjunkies I JUST CALLED TIME OUT!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Funny stuff. I think I will like this series.
screenjunkies If my future children dont like the Avengers, Ill ground them, too.
screenjunkies the Beverly Hills Chihuahua kid because she cant tell the difference between fiction and nonfiction. and Loki and Thor are not blood related because Thor is the son of Odin and Loki is a son of a frost giant my 3 year old cousin even knows that
screenjunkies Iron Man, and will they ever stop making them?
screenjunkies The vast majority of people that have problems with Avengers, or did not like it, likely have never seen a comic book before.
screenjunkies Lol! Ah, I actually did find Avengers pretty boring. Didnt hate it, but didnt fall in love with it either. Phoned in was the best description I heard. Basically I feel like Whedon was overextended on this movie, because it just lacked overall energy and momentum.Warning. Long post:This is just my opinion, natch, but if I could give one example of what just felt lacking and silly in Avengers, it would be the three way with Thor, IM and CA in the woods.Not only did this whole scene feel like a really slow, overacted and syruppy excuse just to say were all cool, guys!, but it had some really silly conceits, like just absorbing a bolt of superlightning from Mjolnir because Energy. 400!!!!That scene bored the hell out of me, but the worst part is that that doesnt distinguish it in any way for me.Basically everything felt very forced and weak. Exposition, plot, characters, even the random music intro for Iron Man. It wasnt particularly exciting in any way for me. And the story was nigh nonexistent. It was just a series of cute little comments with lots of explosions and the requisite drama scenes that were there just to be there.I think people are just a tad romantic when it come to Whedon, because hes acquired some kind of nerd cred. I honestly think the guys overrated (man people are gonna hate me for that), or at least a lot of his stuff is. Really he just capitalises on pretty average  ah, lets say tropes, but since theyre tropes people like, noone notices, or theyre considered whip smart. (Honestly, watch Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and tell me the notgod gods (we get it already, sheesh) and ancient supertechnological sticks of Asgardian heroin made interesting scifi. He basically went out of his way to make sure they were all as boring as possible.)I think Whedons capable of good shows, but I dont think hes the mastermind people take him for.But then, I think Nolans kind of overrated too, so take it as you like. :D(And I still love Firefly.)
screenjunkies I wen to the movies twice back in 2012 to see the Avengers and feel asleep both times! It was sooooooooooooooooooo boring!
screenjunkies I just know I cant be the only human that thinks this is fucking hilarious. I love this guy.
screenjunkies I think DJ Flula had his selfconsciousness and capacity for embarrassment surgically removed as a child. His loss is our gain.
screenjunkies HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA

GameSack This was really funny, but at the same time, they must have known something was gonna happen with his producer right there with a big microphone saying RADIO 1 on it! Still... love Mills and Stark!
GameSack Hahahahaha that was hilarious
GameSack The person with the massive microphone ruined it. So the ppl in the lift were in on it
GameSack This is the reason Scott and Chris should be on breakfast full time. At last a reason to tune in to bbc radio one between 6.3010.00howtocreategoodradio

screenjunkies If you guys really complain so much about everything. Why dont you guys try fixing for yourself and make a perfect transformer movie?
screenjunkies im excited but i really hope the dont mess it up as well
screenjunkies Oh, dont forget: stop making the Transformers BACKGROUND for human actions! Its a TRANSFORMERS movie, for goodness sake!
screenjunkies Everything he said was right
screenjunkies How to fix transformers? Dont make a transformers movie!
screenjunkies The answer is simple: let Guillermo del Toro direct transformers.
screenjunkies The Mists ending was the biggest F You to audiences in movie history. Great movie, but still...
screenjunkies I think if Planet of the Apes really happened, whoever would be left would play the situation in an ironic way.
screenjunkies Which film is before Shuttle Island clip? Saw once a really long time ago
screenjunkies Id better not watch this...
screenjunkies Whats the name of the song ?
screenjunkies Luckily i only havnt seen The crying game and Chinatown so i am not that spoiled.Three other movies if you could have put in something like this are, the good the bad and the ugly, Fallen and american beauty
screenjunkies Daenarys dies. Dont want to hear you guys crying when it happens. Shes a bad character anyway.
screenjunkies I wanted Joffery to win at the end. I wanted him to get the throne.What, this offends some fans?You know what I have to say to say to you sniveling bastards? Go suck on Theon Greyjoys dick.
screenjunkies just thought id point that you were right the first time, Joffrey technically IS a pure wee BASTARD! illegitimate son born out of incest remember? totally diggin ur vids btw, ur a pretty weird dude, but i get u! LOVED the awkward Anchorman Interview eh
screenjunkies my favourite? All scenes with the mother of the dragons, especially those where she was in the nude, stepping out of her bathtub and stuff like that ... love her! ()
screenjunkies dude your awesome, best round up of this show.
screenjunkies my fav part was when Tyrion moved the chair in the meetingcool to see a clever gag than just constant exposition

screenjunkies Honest trailer flappy bird
screenjunkies joffery dies at his wedding
screenjunkies Spoiler alert everyone dies tis simple
screenjunkies The Turtles dont look like Turtles, they look like some sort of Turtle human half breed... with lips
screenjunkies Id shut up and see the movie first really.
screenjunkies sooo dose this man Michael (explosions) bay has retracted his idea of referring to the turtles as aliens? also whys Megan fox in this movie is she April. whats next shia labeouf as Casey.... :( oh no I said to much
screenjunkies I respect all of your guys opinions, we all want to see something different, but quite frankly, im pretty excited for the movie, the turtles new looks are... ok I guess, I mean they arent really uglyper say, but they did get buffer, and much more muscular, the lips are a bit odd, but when you think about it, the TCRI mutagen not only turned them into large turtles, but humanoid turtles, which is why they can walk on only 2 legs, also the back story, its not the best, its not the worst, but its cool to get something new, you guys need to understand, this movie is a reboot, not a continuation, they get an all new back story, and new looks, possibly even new enemies, and for those who didnt notice, the foot also got new looks, and since its the current time, they are using guns! That is awesome, I cant wait for this movie, its gonna be awesome, and also GODZILLA
screenjunkies The 2000s turtles were the best
screenjunkies Bunch of whining little bitches oh boo boo he ruined my childhood when clearly your childhood is over he cant ruin the past only the future man up you skirt wearing pussies
screenjunkies That p.f. krangs shirt is on point. Well done sir.
screenjunkies Im wary. I hope they dont lose all of the turtles character and make it ridiculously overconvoluted...
screenjunkies Andre marry me!! :) You are so adorable!
screenjunkies after failformers nah not enterested in this bs movie and does this director have a hard on for fox or what cmon there are other better actresses out there.......
screenjunkies Do SpiderMans Sam Raimi Trilogy before The Amazing SpiderMan 2 comes out
screenjunkies If you do a winter soldier honest trailer i wont watch it because i cannot see anything wrong with that movie and it was my favorite movie of all time so yeah
screenjunkies Hello guys! My name is Oscar, Im from Kansas and I am a hugeeeee fan of your shows I have seen every single honest trailer and hals screen junkies shows more then 3 times, your content is just so great I recommended to anybody, so, in honor of my great aprecciation and loyalty to your channel I would like to ask you a huge favor.After I saw captain america 2, I was blown away with the movie but there something that made me rage about it and I would love if you could ask the following phrase when you do the captain america 2 honest trailer:You seen captain americas shield hold its own againts Thors Hammer (shows scene of the avengers), but cant fucking keep it together againts a grenade launcher (shows scene of the winter soldier shooting a grenade to captain america).Hopefully you could include this, and if youre wondering why I am pissed, is because thors hammer was made from a core of a dying star which weight more than a million tons, have a nice day and I hope you find this phase good enough for an honest trailer, goodbye!
screenjunkies do the first xmen movie
screenjunkies Say : Who parked their car on my sandwich!!
screenjunkies Spiderman, Spiderman, Spiderman, Spiderman!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Robert Downey Sr hahaha
screenjunkies Plenty of them out there. Torantino is the master than it comes to them though. Which of his movies doesnt have fd up stuff in them? Exactly.Anyways a few to mention would be Buried, Hannibal Holocaust(this one actually had real life animal butchering)...and man a few of them I cant even recall the names of, If talking about TV shows I would put Game of Thrones(them torture scenes are just brutal to watch) and Spartacus Blood and sand.
screenjunkies Wrong turn four when they are eating the guy alive!
screenjunkies Tree Rape scene from the Evil Dead. I mean, its a funny movie, but damn is it shocking when she gets raped by a tree.

screenjunkies Modern Warfare Trilogy ........ Shouldnt be too hard
screenjunkies final fantasy advent children, amazing movie based off a video game
screenjunkies Starcraft would make a great movie
screenjunkies Well as far as I know Im trying to have my hopes up that the Last of Us movie doesnt turn out to be a disaster but it bothers me a little that theyre still gonna have Joel and Ellie, instead of changing the characters like they said
screenjunkies Bioshock infinite movie would be amazing
screenjunkies Skyrim: Dragons, nords and imperials, in a free for all!
screenjunkies If they make a The Last Of Us movie ill cry of happiness. itll have to be good tho
screenjunkies The Let it go in this is soo true!!!
screenjunkies I must be the only living thing who doesnt like Let It Go.

screenjunkies I want my dick to host the oscars it would be a RiDE!!!
screenjunkies Harrisson Ford should totally host the next one xD
screenjunkies Obama needs to host the Oscars.
screenjunkies Ricky Gervais should host
screenjunkies to host next years Oscars should be Leonardo Dicaprio cuz we all know hes not going to win an Oscar.... (sigh)

screenjunkies Kermit the Frog. Want him to host the Oscars.
screenjunkies I Saw At The Picture! Is that ELLEN Is The ELLEN SHOW

screenjunkies I would want to see Johnny Travolta do an add in Spain because there is no way he could say any words right if he was advertising dragonfly software to type what you say!
screenjunkies hal rudnick got some hairy arms
screenjunkies We dont see american actors so often in jTV comms recently, except for Tommy Lee Jones.
screenjunkies Id like to send Justin Bieber to Russia to do a LGBTA commercial.

screenjunkies Video length is 4:04.My computer cant find the video.
screenjunkies Not sure if they have access to Galactus, the Skrulls, or Annihilus since they are all tied to the fantastic four.
screenjunkies Make an honest trailer for honest trailers!
screenjunkies vin diesel, a badass actor, is now a Fcking tree........ best. idea. ever.
screenjunkies this is connected somehow to avengers because one of the villains, The Collector, appears at the end of Thor: The dark World
screenjunkies im sorry the movie is not going to pop. i mean seriously its got rocket raccoon there fore its goin to be a big bang, am i right guardians fans?
screenjunkies I was never a fan of Guardians of the Galaxy, except for Root and my Raccoon XD.I do hope it goes well but I am not as hyped. It just feels there for Marvel to make more money unless they try to tie it into the Avengers series Marvel is making. However it needs to be well carried out.
screenjunkies I feel like such a terrible geek for not noticing the Infinity Gauntlet in Thor! I am super excited by the thought of Thanos battling to complete the gems. But, since they did this storyline on The Super Hero Squad cartoon, would it be overkill?
screenjunkies Mark Andreyko, shut up and let the other dude finish a sentence
screenjunkies zoe saldana its dominicanpuerto rican, nothing to do with colombia

screenjunkies im not kidding. do fight club.
retrogametech How many videos are you thinking to upload per week  month? because lets face it: it took a loooong time for another video to be coming. but i still trusted in getting more videos from you and that worked out good. please answer my question it would make my day.
retrogametech Glad to see you havent stopped doing videos btw )
retrogametech Hahaha, I bet the seller is spewing now :PNice work mate, even if it was simple :)
retrogametech You should buy faulty consoles to repair them and sell them so that their not broken for life!
retrogametech Really cool. Ive never actually seen a Vectrex in action, Ive just heard of them. Im pretty sure an Atari joystick will work fine for it if you cant track down an original Vectrex controller.
retrogametech Any day retro uploads a video is a good day.
retrogametech Another RetroGameTech video? Oh YEAH!
retrogametech Good to see a new vid :)
retrogametech Wow, people continue to amaze me, what they will sell as faulty. Well at least you were able to take advantage of this deal.
retrogametech I found something similar for the Pokemon: Mystery Dungeon series. Being A huge fan of all the Mystery Dungeon series I wish I wouldcould have got more. Ive never seen any merch for the Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer branch.
retrogametech you are not ashens. but i enjoy your show just the same.
retrogametech Love it, who would of thought you could hold sonics balls in your hand )
retrogametech well fuck me if you got that lucky getting the 2 you wanted enter a god damn lottery.
retrogametech Do you have a need or want for one or two Xbox (Original) Mod chips?One is packaged unused the other is probably FUBAR.
retrogametech I dont mind about your lack of uploads as when you do upload they are really great quality :D! Keep it up man 3
retrogametech Great video once again! I have a scratched GBA SP (101) and want to change the casaechassis to an NES style one (the white one with dark purple buttons)
retrogametech Love the videos! Out of curiosity where did you buy your premodded GBA?
retrogametech I collect Japanese games that either didnt see a release outside of Japan, or just games I want to know the localization differences in. And I buy a lot of faulty games that just turn out to be dead internal batteries. I bought a collection of the original Pocket Monsters games for 15, it came with the original 6 and they all just needed a battery replacement.
retrogametech can anyone tell me if it is worth getting a psp go?
retrogametech Subbed for your great content, cheers!
retrogametech I like ur videos brother keep them coming
retrogametech Glad your back, your videos are very interesting. Hopefully we can get more eBay junk repair videos too as I find those very educational and interesting to watch.Keep the good work up!
retrogametech Top video martin. Congratulations on the new job. Top channel, top videos, top lad.
retrogametech pretty awesome there man! thanks for that little shout out there as well :) my game selection isnt anything compared to others out there but so it goes eh. I have to say that I am also a huge fan of the ridge racer games myself. Trying to get my ridge racer 5 arcade up and running but it is going to need some other parts to get going. wow, sudden end there at the end but great vid man.
retrogametech Make sure you backup the software for these devices. Just in case the download links go dead. Happened to me in the past with old softwares.
retrogametech Nice little tool you got there. Bet it was good finding the drivers etc.
retrogametech You have the same Netbook as me!  Are you running XP or 7 on yours?  Do you have wireless card issues?
retrogametech yay! you found it im going to try to watch most of your 231 vidios .
retrogametech So, i recently sold my flashcard to a friend who only have a win 7 computer. the software works fine except, the drivers dont seem to work since his computer wont find the device. anyone have any leads?
retrogametech great video, i still have my super card for the gba. but still want to find one for the GB that holds more than 2mb haha
retrogametech Nice! Ive always been looking for a flashcart, but honestly none seem very good. The EZ looks OK, but is really a bit too expensive...
retrogametech http:www.goodylands.comF2AUDLS.htmlhttp:www.goodylands.comUSBWDLS.htmlhttp:www.goodylands.comSCFDLS.htmlTry those mate, if those dont work, post the vendor and part ID, and ill have a ganders.
retrogametech It looks similar to the Ez flash II flash card powerstar, Have you tried the Ez flash Client?
retrogametech were did you get the ez flash thing i have ben looking every were for some thing like that can i have yours pleaseeeees i will show you some cool things like get a gameboy player and play it on a gamecube
retrogametech Hey there Martin, I have a cart which seems to be the exact same as the one you got there  only the stickers different. The SW package that came with it weighs in at 6MB, let me know if you want me to upload it somewhere.
retrogametech Good luck mate, going to be tricky to find software for it. I have one of the old Flash2Advance carts which is now totally useless as no PC I own has a serial port for transferring software to it. In the end I went with one of those EZ Flash IV carts, I remember asking you about that ages ago (but I had my inbox set to contacts only! doh!!).
retrogametech Did you tried EZ flash 2 client software? I remember at the time they used to work with most flash cards. I have two of those till this day, unfortunaly they dont work anymore (
retrogametech This is the most Hyeper Neo game I have ever seen.
retrogametech the strider 2 game is supposed to play like that with a lag so its not any kind of problem with the game
retrogametech Aero the Acrobat is on the Sega Genesis too.
retrogametech Pretty much, I ended up stupidly trading spyro early on, no idea what happened to the Harry Potter 4 and Penguins game I got with my original SP. Back then I didnt have much money so I just stuck to what I knew. Ive had more GameBoy  GameBoy color games than I can count. Most of them I could never figure out or get into. The Pokemon games were repetitive as hell but at least I could beat them. I could tell you A lot of good NDS games though.
retrogametech Thanks for the tip, Ill check it out :)
retrogametech Not to sound weird but one of the main reasons why I like your videos is because you have a calm speaking voice, did you get my message about the android mini pcs? I think youd like them
retrogametech I recently bought an original Nintendo DS on eBay for around 6. Seller was convinced that the system was broken beyond repair, turned out it was just out of charge. Basically it was a steal
retrogametech I love my GBA. Got screen light mod and I play FZero on it. Loving micro machines.
retrogametech Pickup videos arent as good when you dont tell us how much you paid for them, and its not much of a pickup video when you pay the average price (ebay).
retrogametech Haha, nice! Love those types of bargains!
retrogametech Hey RetroGameTech: one game for the GBA I would recommend is Rayman Raving Rabbids: its got really bad ratings but is incredibly fun to play, I really enjoyed finishing the game, and the only letdown was the ending... Thanks for yet another great video )
retrogametech How do you connect all of this to your tv? There is no way that your tv has enough inputs for each of those devices?
retrogametech a pokemon n64 would look wicked in amongst it ) hahahehe.. ive just sneaked my very own retro corner back into the living room to the mrs horror but just got me snes clone plumbed in at the moment.
retrogametech Friday ill be shooting a 2013 Gaming Snapshot as im all sorted in my new place with my gaming setup up and running!
retrogametech weak sauce on milk toast, mate.. but true none the less.. i even have some shelves! i just cant fit them into the room! haha.
retrogametech Ive been holding out on one of those for a little while now. Id like to wait for the hardware and software to develop just a little further before jumping in. They look pretty sweet though! You got any recommendations?
retrogametech You say that with your massive collections. :P
retrogametech I love the format. Im still sad it lost out to Bluray because I think it was the better format. I picked up most of my discs when places like HMV were trying to rid themselves of excess stock after HDDVD lost the support of manufacturers and publishers. Most were only 12 newsealed! XD. Same as you I picked up a few 360 players from CEX and Game for between 510. Unless you run the audio through an amp its going to be pretty quiet. Are you using it with a PC monitor or something?
retrogametech Sumvision Cyclone Micro. I cant fault it :)
retrogametech I have the same TV, bought it 3 years ago for 299. Probably the best purchase Ive ever made  I think itll last me until 4K is affordable. PS Love your videos, Im an engineer so the inner workings of things fascinate me.
retrogametech yeah, i know 50 isnt too bad but i find it difficult to spend that much money on only one used item. just my own hang up there
retrogametech The dream eye would be a cool video AYE
retrogametech Haha, yep 100 authentic! :)
retrogametech those dreamcast coasters are awesome xD probably better than what i been doing and putting my tea on a corrupted cd i made into a coaster xD hey its a broken cd what else am i gonna use it for?
retrogametech do you think youll ever make a cabinet for it to make it into a arcade game?
retrogametech I still pray for a release on HBMAME, the missing NeoGeo Prototypes. That could be awsome.
retrogametech ah danm i was going to buy two i hate you now but i love you for getting one
retrogametech You might enjoy android mini pc, would be cool to see you do a review on one since you can run emulation easily with android and load up all your roms onto a sd card.
retrogametech strange, i had a CRT tv up until 2 years ago and i could never hear that.
retrogametech Only 7 games for a full set:)
retrogametech This is the same item Ive been looking at for week or so. I soon as I saw this vid, I rushed over to eBay and bought one, loll. Only one left now guys!
retrogametech Just wondered if you could help as I to purchased a Hyper 64 fighting board with Fatal Fury and I assumed I could just plug the jamma connector from my consolised mvs in to the Hyper, But when I did it boots up fine and displays a picture but I have no sound and my controller doesnt work...is there anything I need to do as I seen from your video that you was using a consolised mvs to power up yours. I have even changed the switch underneath from jamma to mvs but still no luck. Great vid!
retrogametech Ive got the king of the fighters on ps1 and some of the characters look like the ones in king of the fighters
retrogametech I wonder how lucky it is to have a father like youHey can I get an xboxSure pays 50 and repairs it
retrogametech are you going to get a 2ds?
retrogametech Ive been using shampoo! :P
retrogametech Very nice pickup, a very nice looking controller at a very nice price
retrogametech can you make a video on how to repair a broken analog stick on a 360 controller? it would be intersting to see your take on the subject.
retrogametech He probably tried to mod the controller and failed so he sold it xD
retrogametech You should probably buy those tools instead, itll be cheaper than shipping it to him and paying him to fix it, since hes unlikely to do it for free.
retrogametech i have a xbox duke that right analog stick is messed up. i cant see how to fix it. it is loose and dont really work.
retrogametech Marting, coc de lah? Lol. Thats how r u in Russian. :P
retrogametech It plays everything :)
retrogametech With such a small PCB that would make an excellent case modding candidate for making unusual objects into gaming consoles :)
retrogametech Its the first Stage music of the first Streets of Rage.
retrogametech they should make neo geo clones for once
retrogametech My only main issue with it is that the cartridge slot doors are bright red. Other than that, it looks pretty nice. Been considering getting a Model 3 because of the sleekness of it and the built in region mods are an excellent touch
retrogametech Ill assume the 32X wasnt compatible lol!
retrogametech Thanks for that link! I just watched it. Really interesting and very funny documentary. Now Im on a mission to find myself an original Dendy for the collection! :) Thanks for watching!
retrogametech Loved the ending , I wonder what else can fit on that clone machine .
retrogametech Are you going to picking up the 2ds?
retrogametech whats wrong with you? no nostalgia for mario? how young are you?
retrogametech Those are great for pulling hard drives for back up drives.
retrogametech Is there any cheap route to backup Gameboy and Gameboy Advance game saves from an original cartridge and replace a battery for the cart and put the cart back in.
retrogametech Cool stuff! Ive been busy with Professor Layton games on DS lately. Amazing how much useful stuff you can extract from these junk electronic devices.
retrogametech I cant remember. I think I got it on Amazon a while back. Probably about 1520.
retrogametech he mostly has some of the good ones, but mostly the Wayforward made games
retrogametech Seagate, belongs in the bin.
retrogametech these videos are great dont stop making them!
retrogametech man you got some good deals, i wish i could get deals like that, and its weird to hear someone say north american imports, mostly cause i live in north america lol
retrogametech I thought that yellow Game Boy was a prototype at first because of the missing lettering. :P
retrogametech OMG! A Pokmon Mini!!! Ive got 2: a green one (played and used, completely funtional) and a blue one (touched only once to check if its working). FINALLY someone who has one!
retrogametech Honestly nothing beats a nice clean DMG :) Funny fact actually, we get the same DS cases in Australia, but we also get the black cases. Many businesses here import UK copies and sell them here at Australian release prices. The DS section looks better with the spine art, great video as always bro!
retrogametech I have the standard on tour version of guitar hero DS :)
retrogametech I watched some comparison vids on the original VS remake of Ico. Youre definitely much better off with the PS3 version. I might try and hunt down the HD version instead. Ico seems like a pretty chilled out game. Not tried Shadow yet. You cant complain getting them free on PS :)
retrogametech I just noticed the size of your hand.
retrogametech Loving the dedication to own Ping Pals :D
retrogametech I actually had guitar hero on tour, similar to the one you have, and I thought it was pretty fun to play I was addicted to it for like a month, but I had to sell it once I bought the dis
retrogametech I used to have a silver SP which was backlit and I sold it for 50 AUD
retrogametech Man has a Australia wish I could found these. Great video
retrogametech Oh neat! Thats good to know! Might keep my eyes peeled for one if theyre not too hard to find.
retrogametech I have the ags 101 and ags 001
retrogametech Interesting to see the Australian variant ended up over here!
retrogametech Hi I have a SP with this tribal black things over it. it says AUS on the back is it rare or super rare?
retrogametech Well done! Never hurts to have a parts devices for your consoles in case they develop issues later on.
retrogametech PS: i love that megadrive switch on the neo, thats awesome dude :D
retrogametech How long did it take to learn how to do this sort of work? I would like to learn how to work with my own consoles and Im about to start computer tech classes at a community college. Hopefully that will be a good start.
retrogametech Haha cheaper aye!! Dont we all mate!! :p Thats why most of my neo geo games consist of MVS carts..
retrogametech True. Might be able to use some parts off it to fix a faulty MVS board I have :) . Sadly the amount of hours it would have taken to get properly repaired wouldnt have been worth it in the end. Maybe if the cart slot hadnt been cracked it would have been a different story. Thanks for commenting as always! much appreciated :)
retrogametech Theyre really solid machines! :) I just wish the games were a bit cheaper! Not on the forums, nope.
retrogametech Its not really an Easter egg. It says in the manual
retrogametech Is would be so cool if you could choose color of the gameboycolor
retrogametech The question, then, is why they couldnt just use the GBA emulator that the 3DS has. If that thing can play Wario Land 4 and Fire Emblem, why cant it play some GBA enhanced games?
retrogametech Get a faulty one and make a video about it :)
retrogametech I love how you scrutinize and really care about the resolution and aspect ratio!i dont have a 3ds but I will pretty soon, the one I purchased is faulty but a lil bit of work an iam sure it will be right as rain. Thanks for some insight on the systems properties :)
retrogametech yay befor 301 views love your videos
retrogametech The 3D feature is a very nice idea. I wonder why they dont do a better job of advertisingpromoting these features!
retrogametech Thats... actually a pretty dick move.
retrogametech 32X isnt that good, I know its the hip thing to say, but its is true, there are a few, very few good things on it. I dont like C.C., but DooM 32X and Star Wars Arcade, those are good.
retrogametech When you said sonic three was too fast, you mean it was even faster than the north american version? Or was it only the first sonic game that had different playback speeds between regions?
retrogametech Thanks dude. Apart from that video of the guy using his Scorpion with a 32X Ive not come across anyone else trying it. I think he mentioned his was modded back to NTSC. But it seems that without switching out componentshardware, the 32X and Scorpion are not compatible. Im probably just missing something really obvious though! :P
retrogametech It did, just forced through 60Hz making it a little too fast. Region protection prevents it from playing in NTSC mode.
retrogametech Fun but a little infuriating at the same time. I was mostly just worried about damaging the 32X :P
retrogametech Well done mate, i think its the first video of yours i have seen without a 100 happy ending.
retrogametech Thats not a video sync issue imo. The game locking up and the background scrolling with glitches lends itself to the same conclusion. Id suggest the 32x is having problems communicating with the Scorpion.
retrogametech See my reply to Darius Davis below :)
retrogametech That cover art for RE4 is amazing. So much cooler than the north american version.
retrogametech Dead Space on the Wii is one of my favorite games. :) Ill have to check out the Neo compilations. Cheers!
retrogametech I actually like Red Steel, Red Steel 2 is a lot better though
retrogametech Wow, nice selection of game to add to the list! cheers! Haha Onechanbara. I saw that the other day for 2 and didnt know if I should or not. I already have it on the 360 but the Wii controls are a ton of fun for that game! I kinda regret not getting it now. I love the lightgun shooters. Got myself an Overkill Hand Cannon a while back in one of the sales. I dont see so many hunting games here sadly. I dont think many got released in the UK for whatever reason.
retrogametech Thanks for the suggestions! Im wondering the same thing about the prices. Will the better games start to become hard to find and expensive? It seems to be the trend with the Nintendo consoles. Just look at how popular GameCube has become.
retrogametech Cool pick ups man! Its really the time to go after Wii games right now, they can be had for next to nothing right now!
retrogametech wow... I can only dream of paying 0.99 for a game in Brazil, even an used game is pretty expensive
retrogametech Yeah, in fragile dreams, you are a kid... and out of everything, I got ripped apart by a pack of wild dogs while trying to walk through a subway. The story really drew me in, sort of like watching a movie. Not sure about the replay value, but for a first go the game is pretty good :)
retrogametech Thanks, dude. Already got it and thoroughly enjoyed it! Cheers :)
retrogametech Is Fragile Dreams the one that scared you? haha. It looks cool. No More Heroes 2 and RedSteel 2 have been added to the list. :) I have one of the DLC bit.trip mini games installed on the system. I think its called Run? I kept falling at the same point everytime and nearly rage quit, haha. The compilation does look good though. Perfect match for the Wii controller. Yeah great time to build a nice little collection. So many weirdinteresting games to choose from and all very cheap.
retrogametech I wish i had a store near me that sold these types of gaming memorabilia!
retrogametech Couldnt just leave it there at that price! :P
retrogametech You didnt know the 3DS played music!? It has some pretty sweet 3D interactive visualizations to mess about with. Theres some really trippy stuff to mess around with while you listen. Its great :)
retrogametech Looks better than Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix.
retrogametech I wonder why they say it isnt compatible with the older GBA models. Thats strange. Cool video man!
retrogametech Ive never even heard of it before, Im surprised Nintendo didnt promote it more in the day. BTW Martin, not seen you on any of my videos for ages, are you still subbed to me dude?
retrogametech nice find boxed you will get 20. for that in five ten years i reckon
retrogametech Awesome for 98p ! evan 2p left over from a pound !! i love a bargain ! :)
retrogametech Can you mod this to output RGB?
retrogametech That would be cool. Maybe he could answer some questions about the system. He might not know much about it, or even remember it at all, but who knows... he might be able to shed some light on things. In any case it never hurts to ask, and he would probably be happy to know his name turned up on a scrap of paper from 20 years ago. Let us know in a follow up video what he says. :)
retrogametech That RF switch is an original ColecoVision RFswitch... Odd
retrogametech Also, hes on Twitter. He looks to be about the same sort of age to have been able to do the instructions 20 years ago, and he lives in Taiwan where this thing was probably manufactured... get this, he teaches English there, so he would have been perfect for the task of coming up with English instructions. twitter(dot)comTELtaiwan
retrogametech I think it looks kinda cool too! But thats just me :P
retrogametech i might be wrong, but i think that the reason it is locked to PAL is a feature of the console as many Tvs back in the 90s where not compatible with 60hz NTSC, the reason for the main oscillator on the board is that the chipset and cpu (68k), sound (z80) will have its own clock divided by the custom Chips, to be compatible with other regions the clock are changed but the final video output will stay at 50hz pal, very clever for a 90s clone, i wonder if the 32x can be made to work?
retrogametech Youre no doubt correct. Ive since managed to switch the console back to 60Hz mode to remove the borders and slowdown :)
retrogametech very cool piece of kit, especially for being region free, its probably locked to 50hz as not many pal TVs would have been capable of 60hz back then. so outputting 60hz wouldnt have been very useful at the time.
retrogametech I measured the points with a multimeter and they were all the same so I dont know. Ill have to take a closer look at it this week.
retrogametech Hey I think the problem with sound is the game try another game cos I had the same problem with the sound and a mate ungraded the sound chip on my neogeo and had no problems with it since.
retrogametech But I dont have those parts. Those are some of the bits I need! :P
retrogametech Nice Video!!! Greetings from Germany!
retrogametech haaaaaaaaaaa hell naw your on my ps3 friends list bro
retrogametech thanks. lets give it a try then. now the only problem is finding a connector then.
retrogametech tried to PM and failed. Hi I just want to ask you something technical... I have got an extra NES console... And I want to convert it to a famicom. I disabled the NEs10 chip. Other than soldering a 60 pin connector to main board, do I need to do any thing else? Because I have seen some converters from old NES carts and they all have a chip on it. And I dont know if a direct solderin would work?
retrogametech Gyromites in PAL region doesnt have that converter.
retrogametech Will you be buying Ouya?
retrogametech Im going to try a similar set up, Wii component  VGA scaler  scan line generator  a VGA to HDMI converter because my new tv doesnt have a VGA input. Still waiting for it all to arrive but Im curious to see the results with my own eyes.
retrogametech I totally get what youre saying and on paper what Im doing with the Wii in this setup technically doesnt make sense. But in practice, and more so to the naked eye, the perceived image is greatly improved. Ive personally always found the Wiis video output particularly fuzzy, washed out and poor quality in comparison to other consoles. For whatever reason the scaler and SLG just seem to have an anti aliasing effect which overall I really like. Its not perfect but its a good improvement :)
retrogametech I have one of those Wii HDMI things you stick up the Wiis butt, and it works pretty well. I only really have issues playing NES virtual console titles on it. My Metal Gear Solid: TTS LP was recorded with it.
retrogametech play an older console that wasnt meant for HDTVs , on your HDTV and you will see. IMO, games that werent made for hdtvs, look like complete crap on hdtvs, so a lot of people will buy the older tvs to play them on, or you can get one of these scan line generators and get the same effect, and not have to have 2 tvs.
retrogametech No idea why but I always prefer playing GBA games on the Gameboy Player vs anything else.
retrogametech Why do you prefer a 4:3 aspect ratio over a 16:9 ratio?
retrogametech It makes a massive improvement to older systems on LCD Tvs. Check out a YouTuber called faginrs500. He has detailed vids on the subject with examples.
retrogametech Definitely get yourself a set of component cables for the Wii. Dirt cheap and totally worth it :) . And yeah, its a very nice way to get around the GameCubes expensive and rare cables :)
retrogametech OMG! Hes got a Xbox ONE! )
retrogametech I think a lot of Wii and GC games were originally coded for that ratio. 16:9 is just a bit much for something like the Wii to handle well. 4:3 looks much better IMO.
retrogametech Ah I understand the scan lines now! They make it look like a crt tv right?
retrogametech I always find it so hard to find good deals of faulty consoles online any tips?
retrogametech See you got seamamm for dreamcast heard so much about it never seen anyone play it though is it good?
retrogametech haha just when i have nothing to watch the best tech man brings out a video woop some nice pickups there and my god the wii looks epic when you get chance play madworld its only a 6 hour game but my god is it fun! :)
retrogametech we have the same tv stand
retrogametech Lol you love the scan lines dude
retrogametech Its what it does best IMO :) . It great to still be able to play stuff like HOTD even though I no longer have a CRT set up. Have you ever played Dead Space Extraction? Its probably my favourite onrails shooter ever :)
retrogametech Hey Ive got a challenge for you! Ive got an xbox, I brought it off of a guy with the description flashed in brilliant condition It has e74 and Everything has been tried to recover it. I will send this to you and I want to see if you can repair it! The guy I brought it from has tried everything...
retrogametech Thats funny because its one of the only fighting games I can actually get into :P . DOA and Breakers on the MVS are about the only ones Im any good at. I dont know what to suggest. Ive always just found DOA very intuitive, fun and easy to play. Other popular fighters generally seem complicated and too technical for my tastes. Overall Im not all that great with the genre. I just play for fun :)
retrogametech Would I be able to send you my genisis and see if you could fix it?
retrogametech Would not know where to start lol maybe we can pm and see if u have time to help me out. Thank u
retrogametech Thanks. It probably looked worse than it was. Luckily the traces and components on a MD mobo are pretty big and easy to work with :)
retrogametech Brilliant fix mate..... Hummmmm let me have a look through my bits of stuff to send to you to fix lol. I gotta Pc Engine that have been badly RGB modded if your up for it
retrogametech Haha, when I turned the board over for the first time and saw all the damage I did consider emailing Daz to say it was dead :P
retrogametech its both. the sound doesnt work at all the and screen comes on but its really weird looking. I actually have a blue one and a black one. if someone could get just one of them working i would give the other in trade and pay for the parts and shipping. do you know someone? i recently tried my luck with a soldering iron and destroyed my headphones. i really dont want to take that risk.
retrogametech Wow thanks! You have some skills there! I mean I tried to fix a PS2 controller, a PSP and a PS1.. All of them are not working : But I wont give up. Thanks for responding and keep posting these videos!
retrogametech So many repair places wouldnt of bothered with that repair, but it shows just how skilled this repair was! Great stuff man, really looked like toast with those large cracks.
retrogametech Does anyone else hear a faint high pitched noise in the background? If not it might just be my speakers.
retrogametech Yes another repair video soo cool thanks!!!
retrogametech Martin, watching you fix an old controller is better than an network T V tat!
retrogametech You seem to have very very much knowledge about retro consoles, nice fix again!
retrogametech Another great video Martin. You seem to be some sort of retro gaming wizard with the eBay finds and repairs. Look forward to the next video!
retrogametech Thanks dude! Haha, its funny because I actually had considered that. The charity shop where I got the little Sony had another identical model for sale. It was gone buy the time I went back but it would have mad a cool little mini cab project :) . I have zero room for even a mini cab though so probably for the best! :P
retrogametech What was wrong with the sunken select button?
retrogametech First comment. Another great video!
retrogametech Cool project. Glad you got it working. Neo Geo Rocks!
retrogametech Now find someone to make a demake for it for the mega drive.... Probably would have been a side scroller run and gun.
retrogametech Thanks for the video :)
retrogametech Thanks. The game is tons of fun. Great sense of humour and brilliant soundtrack!
retrogametech somebody should make this game a homebrew sidescroller shooter and release it for the genesismegadrive. i remember halo came out for the atari. and angry birds has a homebrew genesis cartridge too.
retrogametech Pitch that idea to Ubisoft and dont forget to tell them to pay you )
retrogametech Sure, why not! But I think the 32X addon will be required for full 1080p :P
retrogametech Nice work, love your videos and projects mate :)
retrogametech love how people spelled NET WORK SYSTEM back then.
retrogametech this device plus someone who is enterprising enough to do a custom ROM to take advantage of this (the MDGenesis Everdrive would do it) could do some interesting things with it )
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Wow that Cyberball game is awesome not only because of the game but because it had p2p multiplayer :D
retrogametech its sad that sega left the console market considering how groundbreaking and innovative they were, way ahead of the game. sad thing is, if they just lagged behind 6 years like nintendo, maybe they would still be alive today.
retrogametech because they had real experience making arcades from long time ago...
retrogametech Redonkulous isnt it? :P Online banking in the 90s using a Mega Drive!? Google the pics for Sega Mega Answer if you havent seen it already, haha. Funny you mention the MS 3D. Was messing around with that the other day on the little Sony CRT. The phrase holy shitballs! springs to mind! It works perfectly! Really surprising future consoles didnt adopt the tech and run with it.
retrogametech im very jealous, you have the full sega power tower combo plus infrared controllers, cdx and now the megamodem. congratulations for show us this piece of history...finally know the reason of a hole in the back of Genesis. Regards!
retrogametech I live in the land of RGB SCART :P . Watch my previous vid if youre interested to know more ). My SLG3000 vid and cable management vids also cover more details.
retrogametech I LOVE CRTs, they are an absolute must for gaming, retro especially.Ive had nothing but problems going HD, with LCDLEDs and plasmas which both share a slew of problems(Motion blur, ABL, input lag, frame doubling for 30fps videogames ect) I keep falling back on my 27 Sony wega CRT SDTV. I had the 32 since the earlier 2000s and i absolutely loved it, but i switched to a 60 plasma as of late for my living room, but im not exactly too thrilled with its dim picture. IMy 27 Wega CRT however is super bright, black levels are great, no lag, a super crispsharp picture(using component cables) no ABL, no viewing angle issues, perfect crt motion, its a fantastic set.
retrogametech Since SCART doesnt exist here, youd have to order them for each console at around 1520 USD each, which can add up up rather quickly for large collections since no one has any laying around. Component is close in quality, but the signal is more related to Svideo than RGB, and nothing older than a PS2 can do that natively. Not only is Svideo disappearing, but sets here are already starting to remove dedicated composite inputs, wanting you to put it through one of the component lines. Cheap.
retrogametech As european I can say that our RGB TVs are and was the only salvation in the 90s and early 2000s. Thanks to his magic we was able to play NTSC consoles and games at the maximum quality. Discovered with the first Playstation, SCARTRGB was always my choice when possible. Too bad that SNES and N64 didnt have an RGB output...
retrogametech Thats the same TV I have in the bedroom, got it back when I stayed in Holland i 2000. Still working great and picture still holds up!
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech You can make MegadriveGenny cables since they use standard sockets, PCETG16 you can build a connector, but pretty much everything else needs a different proprietary connector, and they usually dont have all the pins populated so youd probably have to cut up an actual RGB cable to make a homemade RGB cable. You can pretty easily add a SCART socket to those arcade scaler boards, for the silly price of entry on just cables. Time to try undercutting and exporting boot sale SCART cable sets?
retrogametech I remember wanting a Sony Trinitron TV when I was younger for my SNES and PS1. I begged my parents one time when we were looking for a new TV, but they refused because the Trinitrons carried a significantly higher price than regular CRT televisions. Funny how its just so much cheaper now. Hey Martin, by the way, will you be doing a pickups video soon? Or a progress update on your cMVS? Just wondering.
retrogametech Thanks. I thought so too :)
retrogametech Thats very true. Here in Aberdeen, Scotland I didnt have any pals who owned a Nintendo. Everyone had the Master System or the Megadrive. If your parents had the money you were lucky enough to have both. Strange that it wasnt as popular here considering in the states that it was massive.
retrogametech If you are using the SLG, Scaler and Sync Strike for another console (such as your Megadrive) do you need to run a separate audio lead for the sound? I dont have a Dreamcast (yet) but Id like to try this with a few other old consoles I have. Thanks.
retrogametech Do you know anything that replicates the blur effect that the arcade games from the 80s  earlymid 90s using CRT monitors had? I have a supergun that I use to play my arcade boards on my CRT TV but the blur effect seen on arcade monitors is of course missing. The SLG 3000 would help with the scanlines, but my TV only has composite inputs. Still I would love to get that blur effect.
retrogametech In my opinion, the picture on a CRT computer monitor looks better than this. I understand the convenience of having all of your consoles hooked up to one TV, but for me, it makes more sense to have an HDTV for modern consoles and a nice CRT for retro games. I dont see any reason to buy a device that simulates the real thing when I could just use the real thing itself.
retrogametech but SLGinabox cost 170 EUROS!!!! the heart of this system its a chinese PCB with GBS8220 signalupscaler processor, this PCB cost 40USD, the quality is just acceptable, but the price fot SLG.i.a.B its a bad joke. Regards!
retrogametech In the not too distant future sourcing good quality, working, CRTs is going to get pretty challenging. Ive noticed it becoming much less common to find them discarded at the side of the road or cheap on ebay. It seems like many of them have already found their way to landfill.
retrogametech where can this be bought from, which site?
retrogametech Youre new to the Dreamcast, so it may appear to be noisy to you. But to me, hearing the noise of the DC disc drive certainly has a Pavlovian effect of awesomeness. Everytime I hear a Dreamcast fire up, whether in the same room, or on a video, it makes me want to get my Dreamcast fix on. Someday Tom... you will know what I mean.
retrogametech Was there an official SEGA VGA box? Ive never seen one.
retrogametech Id do the same if I had room for a cab! :P SLG has been one of the best investments in my setup so far! :). Im amazed how good the Wii looks running through one. Its like a different console. Great for the emus!
retrogametech Prank calls on a Mega Drive hell yes.
retrogametech Lol, Im going to pick up a copy of CyberBall and see if I can track down someone who can play a bit of MP xD . Should be fun :)
retrogametech I was hoping a voice would tell you the location of the Dreamcast 2 :D
retrogametech Youd think there would be anymore addons for the system but Ive still to track down the karaoke attachment!! Best.Console.EVER! :)
retrogametech Try calling an iPhone with that thing!
retrogametech Ill do what I can to demo how it would have worked in my review. But basically gameplay would look just the same as if you were playing the CPU with some lag in the menus. Many games that used the modem were of the turnbased type.
retrogametech Haha, I actually did use the NGage as my phone until quite recently :P . The battery life is actually really good! Lasts about 67 days in standby as a phone and about 56 hours as console! Haha, lots of memories from when the internet was dialup and pages took minutes to load. When a single MP3 took 1015min to download :P
retrogametech hey thanks for uplloading the vids on console repair it gave me the courage to say whats the worst that could happen hurt the plastic and i went and repaired 1 of my ps2s i could nt bring my self to chuck away because it was my first on and it works a charm
retrogametech Did you switch out the lamp that you had in the left for another?
retrogametech dont lie am from glasgow thats summer
retrogametech Where is this , I know its Scotland ( Im from strathaven) so ill probably known where this is.
retrogametech How is that, sir, risky? Try roads in Latvia for example...
retrogametech Its meant to snow here tonight  tomorrow (Liverpool), it has been getting colder over the past few days
retrogametech The music is from the 2006 version of OutRun Coast 2 Coast :) . Its OK living here but 80 of the time the weather is uninspiring and miserable.
retrogametech Why cant there be an outrun game like this. Ill buy it ). As always great video.
retrogametech The forest drive at the beginning reminded me of northern Ontario. Not as much forest where live. Great video!
retrogametech He would have made a killing back in the RROD days.
retrogametech this lime green ds is beautifull
retrogametech i got a 3ds with a faulty charger port, replaced that and its good as new....was going to sell it but cant stop playing it now :( btw have you heard of a gb boy colour?
retrogametech The last question sorry ihave capacitor new one same the old but new can i change the exploding one with the new
retrogametech My friend sold a brandnew 3DS at gamestop and he got 40 back  your gamestop sounds like heaven!
retrogametech These videos are like forensics with game consoles.
retrogametech you done an amazing job to all the consoles you have fixed i am impressed :) i subscribed :D
retrogametech I was looking at getting one to use as a sorta throw away DS to carry round with me, as my Gold Zelda one is my precious and I dont want it getting all scratched up lol!
retrogametech Haha, I suppose thats one way of looking at it. Thankfully there were no unidentified bodily fluids or stains to deal with on this one! :P
retrogametech I also have a complete NGage collection including the full download of Payload, a dl only game which cost, I think, GBP14 to get the serial number to unlock the game fully.
retrogametech the Tiger Woods game originally came from Argos........the 7 digit order number on the front gives it away lol
retrogametech Its one of my favourites so Ill try and do a vid some time soon :)
retrogametech I really wanna see the sims bustin out on ngage! :D
retrogametech also would like to see gameplay for anyone honestly, especially ones that use a lot of 3d graphics as opposed to 2d.
retrogametech great work on collecting them all, could you maybe do a vid with your top 5 best games  top 5 worst games???  i love to see sega rally! love that game  would also love to see it shat out the arse of the ngage P
retrogametech Thanks for the suggestion :) . Im probably going to do something along those lines.
retrogametech Ah damn! Sega Rally. A friend of mine found one here for 3 I think at the time he didnt know it was rare, sealed and everything. Talk about luck there. Really happy for you, that youve completed the collection! Such a forgotten system, I rather like it to be honest. Anyway man, congratulations :)
retrogametech I still use my NGage QD but I have only one or two games (somewhere!) Can you recommend any good sources for memory cards so I can emulate them instead please?
retrogametech I love the thumbsticks but my fps FREEKS elite I have them on
retrogametech Wish the Star Wars 360 controller had a blue light. Like the console.
retrogametech I made a very simple mod to my Wavebird the other day. Ive never like the CStick on the Gamecube pads  my thumb always slipped off because the top of the stick was so small  Ive always felt it would be better if was the same as the left stick. This is particularly true when playing an FPS on the Gamecube (or on the Wii with a GC pad). All I did was remove the Cstick from the Wavebird  swapped it out for the left stick of a cheap 3rd party pad from W. Et voila  better Cstick.
retrogametech good to know. Ill need to do this for one of my controllers but for less of a mod and more of the old sticks grips are fading
retrogametech But thats the magic of old consoles! New ones arent as fun :(
retrogametech dont they make aftermarket clear controller cases? why not just leave that one alone and make the controller of your dreams?
retrogametech one of the best DOA game, one of the best fighting game and one of the best dreamcast game as well! full of win. thx for sharing
retrogametech such an easy game but it is good fun.
retrogametech very nice man! also I wanted to tell you my step brother had a red ringed xbox and we tried what you did just unplugged the fan and waited and it works now!
retrogametech Haha, yeah its the Japanese version. I cant take the English voice acting on the others :P . Its nice they give you the option on later games to choose which you prefer.
retrogametech ..using the SLG. Im really interested to see how Mega Drive emulation will look when combined with SLG and the Dreamcasts VGA 480p output. Will test it out soon! Im going to try and make a video about my thoughts on the issue in the coming weeks. So far I really like the SLG3000 but only when used with the DC and with the scan line intensity set VERY low.
retrogametech I actually prefer this style of vid to using a capture device. More personal and much easier to shooteditupload :P
retrogametech Haha. Im playing though the Dreamcast VGA cable which does 480p. Very sharp image and the colours really pop, looks absolutely brilliant. I also run it through an SLG 3000 (scan line generator) which uses magic to give the image horizontal scan lines as if it were an old CRT monitor. The real world effect of this is to give the illusion of adding extra definition to the graphics.
retrogametech The japanese limited edition also has the CG gallery in the game.
retrogametech i know this only applys for some countries the the entire time i was like o shit head heading right for them.
retrogametech Its the perfect runabout for nipping out to Sainsburys :P
retrogametech Youre on the wrong side of the road.........
retrogametech I like these videos its nice to see something different once and a while.
retrogametech What are the zigzaggy lines on the sides of the roads?
retrogametech I could never drive safely on the streets of Scotland. The steering wheel and trafic flow is on the opposite side. Just watching you drive makes me flinch like im going crash.
retrogametech I was wondering the Same thing. WHERE THE HELL DID THAT SONIC GAME AT 10:28 come from!! Someone must know!
retrogametech what does dmg stand for? dot matrix game? nice work mate. i could have done with this back in the day.. got the gb near release and often id be playing it in the back of the car on the way to visit family friends, trying to tilt it so i could use the street lights to see.. then later upgrading to the magnifier  light clip on.. lol
retrogametech unles youbought a mini voltage regulator those little ones for get what there called but i have one used with my raspberry pi portable then you could just go straight from the batterys
retrogametech Nice vid, is this harder to do on the Pocket?
retrogametech your videos are just so good!
retrogametech Lol yeah I would so be trolling game gear owners if I had a back lit gameboy. xD
retrogametech Super guide buddy, I really enjoyed watching that. Very clear instructions  as ever, you make it look so simple.
retrogametech Ive done this mod myself it looks good in real life but cameras do it no justice
retrogametech It works really well. I definitely recommend giving it go.
retrogametech that old tutorial is mine haha! im glad it was useful for your mod :)
retrogametech Tutorial would be awesome fella )
retrogametech How longs the battery life?
retrogametech Grease the gears and rails in the GDROM drive. I just use mechanical grease. Some stuff that goes on my mountain bikes bearings :)
retrogametech I must say, you are my favourite gamingmodding youtuber. :)
retrogametech You seem to have good knowledge of the VMU components so maybe you can answer this. I got a DC yesterday with controllers and everything and the VMU works but after using it later I noticed the screen filled with the ink or whatever that type of panel uses (like when you drop a battery alarm clock and the screen busts) but I turned it back on and it still displays fine. Then shut it off and hours later the color finally went back out of the panel. Im not sure if itll keep doing that or not
retrogametech Is the jap ese dreamcast controller any different from the uk one. Is it any better?
retrogametech Great! I always thought the DC VMUs were an awesome idea.
retrogametech didnt know the european version had built in AV the US version it is RF only
retrogametech man i wish i was like you bro... clever at repairing consoles  fixing things.. im below average at best... its awesome you do these things.. (in the back of mind i think its bogus bcz i wish i could do these things like you..but at at the same time i respect you and your knowledge) i wish at the very least i actually knew you or someone like you i think it would be nice and aweome if you could help fix things.. (you should consider opening a repair site like a send in repair sort of thing
retrogametech I think it might explode into flames then.
retrogametech 4!? Lol and I thought I got a deal! :P
retrogametech Its not that bad but the PCEngine is a lot nicer looking. The TurboGrafx was made unnecessarily large to cater to western consumers. Bigger is better and all that.
retrogametech Just see you have a multi mega, i bought one from a car boot for 3. Couldnt hand over the money quick enough lol
retrogametech Lol you do it everytime martin. You got an eye for a bargain. Good work man.
retrogametech After watching your latest vid I now want a white Japanese PCEngine! Damn you! lol Its a real shame these UK versions were gimped with 50Hz.
retrogametech havent started yet but im going to start learning soon but seeing these kinda of videos makes me want to repair broken electronics like video game consoles. Yeah the reason was mostly to learn a new skillhobby that could prove useful and fun at the same time. The idea came from watching arcade machine repair videos and my love of the old school gaming consoles
retrogametech You wouldnt have been laughing had you smelled them before they got cleaned up! :P
retrogametech I couldnt tell you, sorry. Its just the title sequence music. I dont think its in the OST either.
retrogametech Bootleg MVS carts are (or at least were) extremely common back in the 90s. As I understand it, a lot of bootleggers used older game carts as donors to create pirates of the newer or popular games. Burn a few ROMs, implant them into your donor cart and away you go.
retrogametech Aliens on the DS is excellent! Im a massive Aliens and WayForward fan so it is one of my favorites on the system! :)
retrogametech I just pick stuff up as I go :)
retrogametech do you have a Japanese 32x or do you have a modded PAL or something? I ask cos I have a PAL one but the games are very expensive .
retrogametech i obviously know fook all about neo geo.. i thought the MVS games were mahoosive arcade board type things, not big carts like the AES.. man, metal slug looks gooorgeous.. so does afterburner.. thats pretty much arcade perfect, right? the jap sonic games have so much cooler artwork than the western boxes.. i know thats usually the case, but especially for sonic, god damn i hate that pal sonic 1 box, its so bland! not like sonic at all lol
retrogametech Exciter  Bomb Factory
retrogametech Ce here can I get one of those gb or gba USB things, looks cool
retrogametech I have a question I plan to buy a Retro Bit console from Amazon my real goal is to put a Hard Drive a 300 g drive to save all my room files n its well over 330 files but Im not sure if I will need a custom software I have chips for the room n so on to save software but not sure Im really good when it comes to fixing n putting together but I have no software smarts Help
retrogametech Lol, theyre worth picking up if you can repurpose them! Hacked roms and unreleased games can be very cool. Ive been wanting to try out that Streets of Rage 3 directors cut hack for a while... hmmmm...
retrogametech looks very similar to mine. you may want to consider putting more sram onto the cart. maizemods.blogspot.com
retrogametech Just researching the stuff that interests me :P .Theres loads of info floating about the interwebs :)
retrogametech thanks for sharing this awesome project!!
retrogametech great video, you should do an instructional video or try to do a gameboy advance model
retrogametech That is some epic shit right there man, awesome job!
retrogametech i bet this video was disliked by the guy who made that sonic game
retrogametech Anyone know how to fix horizontal lines on the Gameboy screen?
retrogametech how much is a gameboy in the new condition worth?
retrogametech Your video actually helped me to fix Nintendo. Thanks
retrogametech Awesome and very educational im planning to buy broken gameboys as well since i dont know anything about computers im very happy to see videos like this. Ive always loved those old Gameboysold games.
retrogametech Do you have a gameboy printer i would like to see it in video if you have one
retrogametech fixing a dead machine isnt free either
retrogametech Thanks. Glad you like the vids.
retrogametech Great fix on the screen . And great idea using ice cube tray top video .
retrogametech would you ever do a vid on repairing a game boy advance sp???
retrogametech Irn Bru is so popular in Scotland, that its the only country in the world where coca cola isnt the number one soda!
retrogametech You should consume the drink and bars on camera! Instead of Strange Japanese Food, itd be Strange Scottish Food.
retrogametech IRN BRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
retrogametech Wow, surprised youve not seen them before, irn bru is the biggest selling soft drink in Scotland :)
retrogametech Thats cool that he sent you Irn Bru. The sweets look,well, sweet! Great for energy if youre out walking!
retrogametech at 8am this was more than I could take for breakfast, maybe later
retrogametech lol, thanks for the offer bro, I appreciate it. no need to send anything though. the fact that you are here watching the vids is cool enough.
retrogametech The unexpected ones are the best! Iron Bru! CinemaSnob (Brad Jones) tried that in Brad tries, he said it was really good, supposedly is very popular there too, I have never been there so I am just going to have to assume it is. I love that Atari logo, and Space Invaders, thingy. Dont know what they are called lol. Cool stuff he sent you!
retrogametech for sure bro. Interesting stuff, Ill give it a try. The Atari logo and Space Invaders are bead art beer coasters I think lol. Thanks bro
retrogametech on the wii, if you enable parental controls, all content is blocked that is higher then the rating selected. Now thats a good idea, unless ur kid is smart and can get the code easily.
retrogametech thats because of a law in Europe for child protection.
retrogametech You know what Nintendo needs? Offices in the UK other than Germany and thanks to that disgusting censorship and constant delays with their games. I hardly use my 3DS anymore.
retrogametech Its lame and wont do them any favours, if I was browsing the eShop and couldnt look at what I wanted Id just haul my ass over to the app store or Playstation Store and spend my money there, tbh Im more likely to do that anyway as eShop is WAY overpriced.
retrogametech Its the only choice for many of the 3DS games.
retrogametech This is stupid nintendo
retrogametech Is this only in Europe or world wide?
retrogametech Totally agree! Great way to alienate and disenchant not only their existing customers but potential ones too!
retrogametech Oh Man! It makes it as usable as a brick! Why Nintendo, why!!!
retrogametech The code on the blue game boy advanced is a code from germany.
retrogametech RetroGameTech i have found a mega drive in working order with all wires and 2 controllers shall i bid
retrogametech Martin, what do you think of the new YouTube setup? Yay or Nay?
retrogametech i was just watching all your videos ive just watched like 20 thanks Keep it up!!
retrogametech Drill dozer is brilliant!
retrogametech Lol, you keep calling me Marvin, haha :P. If you liked the original Desert Strike on the Mega Drive then you should enjoy the GBA version :).
retrogametech Sadly its not possible and there isnt a mod for that. What you just need to do is implant all the parts from a backlit version into your regular shellhousing.
retrogametech YOURE SUCH A LUCKY BASTARD WITH THESE SPS FFS BIN TRYING TO GET AN AGS 101 FOR ABOUT 67 YEARS
retrogametech Bit late but, happy birthday! :)
retrogametech Ive been looking for switches like these for a while. I could never find them small enough and with the correct number of pins until now :) . I think removing the RF module from inside the console has possibly even cleaned up the picture and audio quality a little! Maybe something to do with less noise? But I totally agree on removing obsolete tech in place of something better or to add extra functionality.
retrogametech have you tryed the switchless mods cheaper then switches just saying.
retrogametech With the model 2 mega drive you can can get a switchless mod for 5060 hz. All done on the reset button, I have the type of mod on my Saturn, snes. Consolepassion .co.uk do these mods. They do the mod to force the dreamcast to play all none 60 hz games at full screen.
retrogametech A Mega Drive 1 only passes mono sound to the Mega CD. So without using a mixer cable the LR outputs on the Mega CD wont be stereo.
retrogametech Youre much better off with either the Mk1 or Mk2 models. The Genesis 3 was actually manufactured by Majesco and not Sega. Its missing a lot of the features from previous Mega DriveGenesis. Some games are not compatible, missing ports and mono sound etc. Mk2 is the best option if youre tight on space.
retrogametech Nice Martin! I like the low profile and color of the rocker switches.
retrogametech If Martyn aka retro game tech doesnt have the time, ill gladly do one as long as I can find my camera :)
retrogametech You have inspired me to install a 3.5mm audio jack on the back of my Genesis.
retrogametech Good luck I tried to make one a few years ago and I just gave up it was way to much for me but I wish you luck
retrogametech are you gonna put like cool custom stickkers on the carts because they dont look too nice since they only have the name on top in black and white and no art since they are always in the cabinet
retrogametech First off, thank you for replying (Im a big fan) and I know its only a small risk but its still a risk and Id hate to have to see my favourite youtuber go through any pain, anyway good luck with the NeoGeo and remember to wear a mask.
retrogametech Awesome brand new video
retrogametech Thanks. I was watching RetroSwedes project vid the other day. Looks like his SuperGun is coming along nicely. Ill need to stop by your channel and check out your Amstrad project :)
retrogametech nice you do what I do some sketches. But the differences is mine is a MV 1C.
retrogametech RGB scart has been around for 30 years. HDMI has not... When your dealing with hardware from the 80s its not going to have HDMI
retrogametech No worries dude! Managed to remember the numbers from your username and everything, haha! Thanks for the tips! :)
retrogametech No bad man!! Also, no sure if theres a lot of variation in models, but I looked this video up to clean up the Dreamcast my missus got from eBay. On oor wan, you need to remove the fan with the motherboard or it wont come out. Have you came across this similar variant before yersel?
retrogametech I do that but I went and got a big sheet of low magnetic stuff. The sort used for fridge magnets. I just place them all on it and they dont go anywhere.
retrogametech Lol, I was hoping it might get a few laughs :)
retrogametech Very nice, you probably made the 5 minute goal just you were explaining where screws are etc. Anyhow, love how easy the Dreamcast is :)
retrogametech i like your enthusiasm
retrogametech Thanks for watching and commenting :)
retrogametech i did this before. it really isnt hard but a lot of screws.
retrogametech Dreamcast pit stop :P . Sega had some great designers and hardware engineers.
retrogametech That PAL Dream cast is in need of a deep cleansing with some Retr0brite
retrogametech Your videos are the best!!!!
retrogametech You should monetize your channel!
retrogametech Im from portugal, im not really into N gage games, but ill see what i can do. If I do find the game, i can send it to you if you pay postage.
retrogametech If you look on eBay now theres a sealed US version of Civilization for Ngage for 63 BIN or bidding starts at 50, plus 7 postage, dont know if thats the one you saw or if its new. Jus thought Id mention it!
retrogametech them pads look ace, i cant play my md when my 2 yr old is around cos she grabs the wires! I want to play that golden axe remix. It looks great. I love seeing the fake GBA carts. Good vid as usual(after id skipped the waffle lol).
retrogametech Awesome! Good to see those wireless controllers in a collectors hands who could bring them back to life. Nice job with the DVD cover plastic though :P
retrogametech Thanks! And yeah this version of Space Harriers always makes me laugh. The announcer alone cracks me up XD
retrogametech nice video, i like the type of videos you make they are quite cool and interesting and make me have a different view on gaming
retrogametech not bad at all. If you use the braid the beginning you can get to solder off a little easier. If you have a heat gun that allows control of air flow the port will be easier to remove, provided that it can apply as much heat as the iron without all the air. You can presolder the contacts on the board with the flux and the iron. Then use the heat gun to melt the solder when the slot is lined up and its leads will drop into place the second the solder melts. The key is is lots of heat without too much blowing if you can find the right hot air tool. Invest in a hot air heat handle and watch the magic happen.
retrogametech Is it a better idea to remove the mobo from the console before working on it, or does it not matter?
retrogametech Yeah, sadly the pips in this one were too far gone to repair. Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Does anyone have a 3DS for sale on here?
retrogametech game is broken, or spark or worst, a big kaboom
retrogametech Thanks for the vid, helped out alot.
retrogametech it will fuse and send the wrong signal to the wrong places and damage your 3ds even more
retrogametech These videos are great! I think Ill subscribe :)
retrogametech eae vc  brasileiro ou portugues ???
retrogametech Good to see so many modded consoles! That pirate Famicom game looks pretty interesting, Ill need to check out your other vid. Btw, Im seriously jealous you have that DoA stick! haha Theyre really expensive! Thanks for taking the time to post a response!
retrogametech He did it! :) Nice 1 Luke!
retrogametech Luke...hey about some shelves and getting nice feel to your collection? or you out of space?)) anyway thanks for your vids...can you make more vids about japanese gaming stores?)
retrogametech Man you and Retro Game tech, always making me jealous... and for real how the hell can I get an xbox mod chip??? I cant for the life of me find anybody who sells them. where do I look?
retrogametech i can not call myself a gamer after watching your vids.
retrogametech Pushing Onwards playing in the background (VVVVVV). One of my favorite songs.
retrogametech Thanks dude! Would love to see. You should definitely make a vid!
retrogametech I used to repair 360s all the time back when they were going through their unreliable phase. Ive never kept a 360 longer than a year or 2 before selling it to buy a newer revision. The later hardware revisions are much better but Id quite like a 4GB slim for the quieter running. Thanks for watching and I appreciate you taking the time comment :).
retrogametech You are an inspiration to all collectors including me.
retrogametech Time for an update to this video!
retrogametech You must be so bored all the time. How do you not wake up and thing: Holy crap, what the hell am I going to play!? Too many choices!
retrogametech loving the sega collection!
retrogametech Do you remember what your entertainment centers called?
retrogametech Lol, I bet in those days youll be doing videos on doing a ROM hack on your spinal port, have Mega Drive compatible with your brain :D
retrogametech would you sell us one?
retrogametech Can i buy these of u?
retrogametech Cool I wasnt sure how the DMCA affected actually owning and using them things as you are kinda bypassing security features in the DS everytime you use the R4. Im not going to go off on some rant about how bad these things are.... I had one when I had a DS :) great bit of kit for Homebrew especially.
retrogametech Do I hear Splash Wave in the background?
retrogametech Thanks Luke. Getting anymore working is just a bonus. There are a crazy number of firmware versions and hardware revisions to get your head around! Im pretty happy I got those 6 running and found that bonus 4GB micro SD :) . Now Ive just got to figure out what to do with them all! haha.
retrogametech The R4 cards will all work for the ds. You have to download a patcher and new firmware. easy
retrogametech They are illegal to sellhave fullstop in the UK but that wouldnt stop me :)
retrogametech Sadly most of these appear to be hardware related faults.
retrogametech Just looked for it there. Was it about a component mod for the original Xbox1? If so I doubt Id ever do that, sorry. You can find and buy HD component cables for the original Xbox really cheap on ebay. Thats how I have mine hooked up so it outputs in 720p for XBMC and some of the games. Theres no need to install separate connectors like that since the Xbox1 natively outputs component via its own AV port. It would cost a lot more in parts than it would to buy a cable that does the same thing.
retrogametech Im impressed, looks in my mind very good!
retrogametech right in the childhood ... man that hurts
retrogametech Oh christ. The two songs that play are terrible renditions of the Sonic 3D intro music and Angel Island act 1. Took me until after the video to recognize the second one, it was that butchered.
retrogametech dude run y r u walking your supposed 2 make sonic run
retrogametech It looks more like the Saturn version of the game theyre using.
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech The intro music is a really shitty 1 rendition of the title music from Sonic  Knuckles..
retrogametech I know what you mean. The 90s dont seem that long ago. Its weird to think that 2002 was a decade ago!! That was just yesterday, in my mind.
retrogametech It actually looks good.
retrogametech yes! please do more fixes!!
retrogametech cool finds as always dude! btw i downloaded the deme of deadlight! the game you reccomended me! it looks and plays awesome! love the art style in it too! btw how long is the game? is it worth a purchase? cheers dude! :)
retrogametech Were any of them AGS 101s?
retrogametech Holy hell you cleaned up that 360 controller really well. When you picked it up I actually thought it was some faulty brand spanking new controller, kudos!
retrogametech When youve finished the NESs, would you be willing to sell me one or do you want to trade for something?
retrogametech Nice! I wish Id thought to check the warranty on mine before I tore it apart to diagnose the cartridge fault. Ive been lucky with warranty on secondhand consoles a few times in the past. Xbox 360s used to be good for that.
retrogametech Lol, you should have seen the condition it was in when I got it! It was disgusting and I was almost tempted to send it back to the seller (I was pretty angry, haha). Instead I decided to give it a full strip down and refurb. Turned out really nice! :)
retrogametech Id be really interested in that NES version GameBoy Advanced SP but where do I go to buy it? EBay?
retrogametech Hello, Im curious as to how you clean and fix all these systems? Could you make some tutorials? Ive fixed, cleaned, and modded many consoles but some some things you talk about intrigue me and Id love to see how you do it as Im sure many others would love to see as well.
retrogametech The 32x and Model 2 Genesis has a different power jack with the polarity reversed..
retrogametech Great videos mate, keep em coming. I wouldnt be surprised if Retro Gamer called in the future for an interview.
retrogametech Thanks.. I figured it out. I also burned 3 32x units however I managed to get them fixed by replacing one of the components on it.
retrogametech Those are the strangest plugs I have EVER seen. Im used to polarized plugs and occasionally a round grounding pin.
retrogametech how did you get your consels so clean?
retrogametech The PSU was 10 delivered from ebay and the rest of the bits I had kicking about. If you had to buy parts separately them maybe an extra 7. Not sure what that is in CAD but shouldnt be much.
retrogametech Thank you so much for this man, I know many, me included will love this. You are awesome indeed :)
retrogametech Thanks for the checking out my site. Each connection is of course soldered and then shrink tubed over the center conductor to ensure reliable service even under rough use.
retrogametech A work of genius, you should go on Dragons den with that one!
retrogametech It means Multi Video System...
retrogametech Personally, I wouldnt go with MDF, purely because of the fact that it conducts heat so quickly. If you were to use it, I would recommend using thin pieces but also making sure you have quite a bit of ventilation via fans. Other than that, its great! Easy to shape, and providing you coat it, rather strong! Hope this helps!
retrogametech Thanks, Luke. Yeah would love to have a go at building a mini cab! Im still pretty confident I can get that original MVS board running again. It would be really cool to have a little cab for messing around with arcade boards. Loving the Neo Geo games right now! Ive been enjoying Strikes 1945  and Neo Drift Out. I watched your NITD lets play the other day then realised it was actually on my multicart! XD . Win!
retrogametech Will be good to have a working unit, so you can maybe get more games etc Hope you feel better soon, plenty of rest  games :)
retrogametech Thanks! Yep, the whole thing is stock. The battery is in good condition and working fine so no reason to replace it just yet.
retrogametech cool pick up, i just got one of these myself and am planning on doing the console transformation to it as well. i was wondering what you ended up doing for a housing for it. i was going to convert mine to 5v and just make something out of wood and t molding, but i want to see some more ideas. thanks for making the video.
retrogametech sound alot like Arnold Schwarzenegger ... cool
retrogametech Never seen sonic this slow!
retrogametech I could deal with the bad level design and the horrible controls, but that music would drive me to throw the Game Boy across the room.
retrogametech Its only dumped part of the game, repeated loads of times. Its the usual for a Sintax pirate. More info : PGC Forums. )
retrogametech I love how bootlegs always add little mechanics. THROWING his spindash is kinda cool.
retrogametech retrogametch u r lieing
retrogametech funny fake game is copy protected. also i kinda like these games because they are not easy to find sometimes.
retrogametech When you collect a ring, it uses the same sound effect as GBA Pokemon games OO
retrogametech Another great show, you always find interesting little things
retrogametech This is not even the same model as mine however if i see a voltage regulator ill give jumping the power like you have done in a last ditch effort to repair mine.
retrogametech PS. As For Size, I Have Big Ears So My Headphones Are About The Same Size As My Ears And Fir Nicely.
retrogametech Mate could you please add me to your contacts if you dont mind, got a question in regards to this fix.
retrogametech 5.1 headphones? You got ripped off, mate.
retrogametech Can u help me with my kinect sensor it does not go up
retrogametech if characters are being substituted, then you have a stuck address or data line somewhere.
retrogametech i like you watch where did you get it from?
retrogametech It looks like a badshorted pin in the bios chip probably one of the data lines. since you see the lines on the screen, try tracing the bios lines (especially data) and check em.
retrogametech The text is in English, but there are characters being substituted. The RAM test screen says WORK RAM TEST, but the R, T, and space characters are being substituted with S, U, and ! respectively. The same substitutions are showing up in the menu, among some others (Y for X in EXIT).
retrogametech As long as he doesnt touch the ends of capacitors, hell be fine. Personally, Ive never even had a tiny electric shock, and Im always tinkering with old systems
retrogametech dude how have you not got partership yet
retrogametech can you do this same mod with the snes cardtridges
retrogametech could you post a link to your ebay page? id love to buy stuff from you
retrogametech I dont own any SNES games to test it on but I dont see why not. It would probably be even easier considering theres lots more room to work with :) .
retrogametech do game saves get deleted the second you remove the battery?
retrogametech This guy is thinking, far too many people just think oh ill fix it with a new battery and some tape. This is a permanent fix and for anyone who has a mega memory card that uses flash to backup saves this makes the process much easier, just backup and replace every 10 years or so.
retrogametech Very nice :D All button celld batteries have the same 3V voltages, The number indicates the size of the battery. Usually the life of the battery really depends on the environment theyre stored in. :P
retrogametech Very smart way of doing the battery replacement.
retrogametech The lower capacity of the CR1220 wont be an issue with this setup. You could even be super extravagant and replace the battery once a year for 10 years and it would still be about half the cost of buying a single CR2025 with solder tabs. And once the CR1220 battery holder is in place youll never have to solder anything ever again XD.
retrogametech Metallica!! Ride the Lightening!
retrogametech Dont u wanna sale one
retrogametech Sick find. Im looking for an X3ce chip myself. hard little bastards to find these days.
retrogametech Do they make a green version of those screens?
retrogametech Yes, If you dont have any other means of watching your content on a TV, The original xbox is still the absolute best console to use as a media center.
retrogametech Do you ever feel bad for getting a really low price on a really rare console?
retrogametech Aww Dam, I Loved That Playing In The Background hahahahahah
retrogametech Thats pretty cool, and even better that you didnt have to fix it!
retrogametech I have to find a burned out ic on mine, so I can relate. I am always interested in this kind of stuff! Any progress is good progress I say, keep at it man, I hope you get it back in order.
retrogametech i have a cdtv which had no video, turned out to be bad caps on the video board, it seems your issue with video may be similar as it seems your tv is picking up a signal, however no RGB from the video stage, with the sound it may be a similar issue, may be worth getting hold of a chip schematic and checking voltages on power pins and use a logic probe to test channel outputs if not just drop in another 2610 or 2608 which is similar
retrogametech I dont understand most of this but I pick up a few worlds to drop in conversation the sound tech savvy!
retrogametech Lol! EVERYONE is repairing these things lately.
retrogametech Ill make that vid now
retrogametech Who doesnt like faulty electronics talk? Sucks that it isnt working, but at this point, I would be either all in or all out. The YM2610 and Z80 shouldnt be too expensive, and if youre going to go to that much trouble, you may as well replace the caps while youre at it. Even after all that, you could still end up with a non working board. I love old electronics.
retrogametech liksang was a great import store. sony shut it down with its lawyers. sucks!
retrogametech It would be awesome if those little machines actually worked,imagine carrying all your favourite systems in your pocket...
retrogametech Eggs....Sega.....oh, I see what you did there. You so silly, Sega!
retrogametech Very cool. I have never seen them before.
retrogametech How do you get these stuff? I live in Japan but those are impossible to find here...
retrogametech many video games contain easter eggs,..however, these easter eggs contain video games.
retrogametech The machines selling things like this are all over the place here in Japan. Of course they have newer systems these days, but its still pretty cool. If you want to come hang out in Japan Ill show you things that will blow your mind.
retrogametech Congrats for finding that nice replica! Awesome video like always...I think Im going to turno on my megadrive and play some Sonic the Hedgehog. :P
retrogametech i am f....... liking this video
retrogametech Please reply to my PM Martin :)
retrogametech best of luck, I hope it will work out for you!
retrogametech You can but you need to watch out as some dishwasher have a super hot rinse cycle plus they wont clean a PCB than a toothbrush can.
retrogametech Remove any socketed chips (Like the bios) and give the board a good wash with soap and warm water using a toothbrush to scrub. Let it drip dry in the vertical position for 30 minutes then put it in the sun for about 2 hours. You might need to use canned air to get the water out from under the chips to dry good. Make sure the board is completely dry before powering it on again.
retrogametech Thats awesome. Do you buy stuff from craiglist type of sites, not caunting ebay and everything else.
retrogametech Asus vr100g glasses will also work with the Sega 3D Adaptor and they are a bit larger than the Sega versions for those who need the larger width.
retrogametech Thanks to you, I will be able too! :)
retrogametech YES I too got those as a backup to my original 3D Glasses.
retrogametech Excellent vid dude, nice heads up on the glasses :D
retrogametech It was close! Literally less than a mm worth of clearance at just the right angle. I thought I was going to snap the ends off a few times :P Where to put it? I really have no idea! lol I dont have the space at the moment. Hopefully in future when I get a place with a dedicated games room it can go on display with the rest of my geeky tat! :) 1st world problems, eh?
retrogametech There seems to be a bit of empty space in there, it would be awesome if you could modify it to be a working telephone.
retrogametech I would put Sonic N in there
retrogametech Could you give a linkproduct info for the lights please? Thanks :)
retrogametech Thanks! Sadly I doubt Ill ever find any of the original inserts. Stuff like that always ends up in the bin. But you never know :P
retrogametech Dam, Ive Been Wanting One Of Those For Testing.
retrogametech I got my miniSD  microSD converter stuck in mine. Im still able to remove the microSD card inside, but I cannot get the converter out at all. Rather nice flashcart, software was fairly easy to use, etc. Make sure you dont skip the starting saver bit because that is it reading back from the SRAM and writing that to the SD card, it doesnt do direct to SD writes in game. If you skip it, next game you load will overwrite the SRAM. Where did you get that GBC one though?
retrogametech why a save battery if its flash memory?
retrogametech where can i get a gamebox
retrogametech I have this flash cart and I love it.
retrogametech Yes, search for EverDrive. You can get them for most retro consoles :)
retrogametech Can this work in gameboy player on gamecube
GameSack Distance between Saarbruecken and Arlington from 8080 miles is unfortunately too big for me... :(
GameSack Few hour drive for me but Im thinking about it! Well now that you guys are going ... prob not.
GameSack 0  10 plz 2 releees new gaym sak
GameSack Im actually going to try but only if Joe is mean to me and mocks me. If he doesnt Ill feel ripped off. Still, together with Joe we will hold a Sega party to make Dave feel terrible about his Nintendo choices. We will mock him roundly then slow dance to the theme of Joes choice.
GameSack Come to Portland in October for the expo!
GameSack Would be cool if you could make it to PAX AUS. :)
GameSack Are there any good retro video game conventions around Ohio? Ive always wanted to go to one but never know where one is close by.
GameSack lame gametypes for action sack
GameSack That one with the knights would work great on the Wii... of course, then we have Dragon Quest Swords...
GameSack neo geo AES is the one and only for me.still got it and its still impressive. the sound and the graphics are sick. the music really sounds like cd. that is so impressive if you think about that the console came out in 1990. the console was like 8 years ahead of its time. i mean. even the saturn and the playstation couldnt emulate metal slug, last blade or samurai spiritsshodown perfectly. there are still some animations missing from backgrounds or charakters. and there where no loading time at all on the AES
GameSack Ive never been able to afford one of these, so I cheat and play the homebrew Sega Dreamcast ports, of which there are many. I dont think every game has been ported yet, but quite a few have and new ones are still released occasionally. Theyre not totally perfect ports as the sound can be kinda wonky at times (like, sometimes the music will drop out and then randomly start back up again a minute or two later), but theyre definitely a decent option for gamers on a budget if you know where to find them.
GameSack I think I didnt get one was because Im not a big fan of SNK fighting games. This thing was meant for fighting fans.
GameSack They are a lot of neo geo AESMVS games that did not get a release on CD)Any way to take neo geo AESAES rom and burn it to a cd so you could play them on neo geo cd?
GameSack Amazing episode ! You guys are the best ! Keep doing the amazing work! I almost bought the 1x cd read version back in 1995 here in Brazil, but I ended buying the Sega Saturn and didnt regret, as the Sega console also had lots of SNKs classics. And the loading times on the 1x cd rom version are really really annoying...
GameSack How often do episodes of gamesack come out, I started to miss u guys so I started watching older episodes... Again, huge fan of gamesack here!
GameSack ABCSelect  return to CD playerABCStart  reset the softwaretadah!I love GS videos but too bad no AES vs CD in this video
GameSack i dont know...the neo geo neer really appealed to and after this i still say no the neo geo cd, honestly i am not a fan early to mid nineties cd based consuls...it is a good effort but the quality of the cds and (graphics arent eer thing) the loading times, I mean i just want to sit and play. what I do not like about the neo geo cd looks like well, it is a fighting arcade and i do not like that, aside from that all other games were either games that are a ripped off of other games to games that are already on other systems than and now. With that said this was another great episode and although it turned me away from the system and games it was still fun worth watching. Thank you guys and remember this is my thought and opinion so please do not hate
GameSack The neo geo cd has a reset just hold the four buttons and select.
GameSack One system that I hope you cover in the future is the MSX I havent played it but I heard that it has a lot of great games that never came out on any other systems, especially by Konami.
GameSack they should have picked another name than game sack :P
GameSack Man, I always love those postcredit gags.
GameSack She said neeej nej nej, not naaa naa naa (batman)
GameSack I expected many good games back then. Some of these games would actually do well in sales. It seems they felt discouraged about how well it would go.
GameSack Too many boring shoot em ups zzzz
GameSack Magical Popn, the main character looks like Blue Link.
GameSack Thanks so much for this! I never heard of Magical Popn but its super cool! :)
GameSack Despite your admitted poor knowledge of the Japanese language I think its great that you at least put some effort into pronouncing the original names of the games properly and show some respect for the culture jokes aside.
GameSack Great channel guys since discorving it a few days ago, ive been addicted! Top stuff! thanks for the hard work!
GameSack Hey Joe and Dave.....love the series....Im an retro gamer myself....and mostly into imports...You guys arent big wrestling fanatics....maybe left in japan 7 or 8 can be dedicated to the games like funaki hybrid wrestler, stardust suplex or even the fabled firepro wrestling series....I mean there are schittloads out there....you can do a show on firepro wrestling itself.....if you guys need a list....happy to help....
GameSack Another great show. Tempo 2 looks pretty cool
GameSack Can anyone recommend more RPGs with camera angle as on 1:03 that are in English or at least English subtitles.
GameSack Whens the beta again?
GameSack What overall Jamaal is that
GameSack That champ is a beast
GameSack I see you coop wearin my panthers jerseys

GameSack Is the playstation trying to have sex with the SNES? explain this shit!
GameSack WOW! Please dont do this again! :)
GameSack im thirteen and what is this
GameSack Stop making me enjoy my free time
GameSack ewwww why is that sony trying to screw that snes?
GameSack The N64 likes to watch...
GameSack Dude please explain? I watched this last night when you released this video and than you deleted it? I tried to refresh the page to post a comment and it said video deleted ?
GameSack Best console ever, hands down.
GameSack I would have to throw in the Mega Man Legend franchise for the PSX. Great games.
GameSack One of my favorite PS1 games is SpiderMan by Activision. I was a huge fan of the animated series at the time and I thought it was great that they retained a lot of the shows cast to voice their characters in the game, especially Efrem Zimbalist as Doc Ock. The narration by Stan Lee is also great and adds a certain charm that other SpiderMan games lack. The story and gameplay are both awesome and I played through it countless times in the year or so after it first came out. To this day, its still the SpiderMan game by which I judge all others.Also, in the same way that Final Fantasy 7 was the first RPG for a lot of people, Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete was my first and even now is one of the only ones that held my interest long enough to get to the end. Eternal Blue Complete was also amazing, but I like the first game a little bit more.Other favorites of mine are Rayman 2: The Great Escape, PacMan World, Tomba!, Gundam Battle Assault, Resident Evil 2 and Spyro: Year Of The Dragon.
GameSack Do some of you people even watch the video before you comment???
GameSack GAME SACK, Y U NO INCLUDE WIPEOUT!? THAT WAS PSYGNOSIS REAL GEM ON THE PLAYSTATION!
GameSack rayman, rayman 2, the coolboarders series and pacman 3d were some of my favourite games as a kid that werent already mentioned
GameSack Make a review on the Nintendo entertainment system game sack
GameSack Hello Game Sack, You should play Ridge Racer always in cocpit perspective. Its easier to get the drifts in controll. The drifting in the first Ridge Racers is simply the best and later episodes didnt preserve that pretty well.
GameSack Time Crisis is way better than Virtua Cop
GameSack Holly hat als erste das Band des Teams gebrochen :D
GameSack i had bought chibi robo for the 3DS and HATED IT
GameSack The guy on the left looks exactly like an older ketroc
GameSack Gave you guys a shot but it didnt really hold me. I liked your ad anyway! Perhaps another time.
GameSack Jersey Devil, and Blinx..
GameSack Im thirty seconds in and already mad. I love sonic.
GameSack I realized three things. 1. These guys have no clue what a mascot is. 2. Someone never completed the Spydorz story in ChibiRobo. 3. This show is really mean spirited and opinionated.
GameSack In Captain Commando you have to input special commands for additional attacks. Read an FAQ or something at least if youre going to do a video on it.
GameSack Whats the name of the music track played during the end credits?
GameSack You guys know that was chief
GameSack No ChronoTrigger? Unsubbed, reported, blocked, unfriended, deported, extradited, hexed, fatwad, Barbara Streisand.
GameSack I find it odd that many of these picks are all early in the generation. Were there no great games later in the era?
GameSack Say it as it is........You forgot to mention Streets of Rage 2.....Just say it... The problem with your taste is that its not even a taste to begin with.....
GameSack respekt the metriod biatch.
GameSack SCIV nr. 1... Cmon...
GameSack 1 is Final Fantasy VI.pretty much a no brainer
GameSack You guys didnt mention how you can change the turtles skin color in Turtles IV so that they match the action figures! Have you been checking your options menu?
GameSack Great list!! ... and a hilarious Altered Beast joke!
GameSack Castle of Illusion was classic. How about that log witch, huh? Make more top 10s! More, dammit!
GameSack totally agree super metroid is fuckin awesome and my fav game of all time
GameSack So, no NeoGeo games at all?
GameSack Brutal: Paws of Fury. Oh god, its horrendous.
GameSack never thought Strip Fighter was an actual game...
GameSack How do you make a show about other fighters and do not put any snk games......?
GameSack You missed World Heroes. Pretty much a Street Fighter rip off but it was really fun. The second one especiallly.
GameSack Doomsday warrior for the snes.
GameSack Gundam Wing: Endless Duel for the Super Famicom is awesome. Played it to death when I was a kid.
GameSack do you guys consider neogeo 16bit or 24bit?
GameSack tekken 3 actually had a 2d fighting game
GameSack I rooted for denver this super blow 48
GameSack Great episode. I want to play Night Slasher so badly now.
GameSack When are you guys going to make another episode of left on the arcade?
GameSack Cadillacs and dinosaurs! Beast beat em up I ever played. It never got to home consoles.
GameSack Night Slasher does look good. Wish Sony would get the license to past arcade games like Night Slasher and Sunset Riders, these type of games would be great on the PS Vita.
GameSack Theres a super fun arcade beatemup called Vendetta that never got a home release (as far as I know). Its challenging at first, but once you learn the bosses patterns you can get pretty far in the game on a single credit.The controls are great, and the special moves are easy to pull off. They dont drain your life bar, and yet dont unbalance the game. The Japanese version actually includes fetish villains wearing leather chaps who attack you by trying to hump you...!I could die happy if you included this game in your next Left in the Arcade!
GameSack 8:25 How dare you slander Game sack Dave!!? There may be cheesy jokes, poor segways and crummy voice over delivery, but lame is no way to talk about this fine show. Apologize!!
GameSack Wild guns from natsume on the snes seems like a spiritual succesor to blood bros. except no goofy cabal dance XD
GameSack For your next episode try Hammerin Harry! Damn I loved that game.
GameSack surprised they didnt mention Aliens the arcade game, that to me is still the coolest Alien game ever made but for some odd reason it never got a console release..
GameSack Love it! This a super fun series, keep it up girl!
GameSack Modest Major King of the scrubs
GameSack I played this gametype for about an hour and it was so fun! I remember playing this gametype in Halo 3 and Reach and just having a blast. The only issue I have with it is when I get these great games, I feel like I cheated my way in here to gain a high KD ingame and multikills. I might just do a highlight video because it is way to easy to do well in here XD
GameSack That idea is really interesting!!
GameSack That is one amazing PC. A real shame they demand such prices.
GameSack I love you guys. These videos are what I always wanted to see on youtube. I hope the copyright police never touch you.
GameSack As usual great episode. I just had to watch it again. Im drawn to the X68000 for some strange reason, maybe its my love for old school Capcom and Konami games and they seem to show the X68000 a lot of love.Also I love the different midi devises . Thx again for a great episode, quality as always !!!
GameSack the cockpit actually seemed good
GameSack 6:32 Dave said jerk off, I thought this was a family program!
GameSack You gotta love that dualtower design. Very sexy.I love me a good mech game, so a few of these look right up my alley.
GameSack My heart sank a little when that large floppy disk was folded to fit in the X68030, is that a bad thing?
GameSack Well, the Capcom ports are near arcade since, aside from developing their earlier arcade games on Moto 68000 machines, the CPS1 and 2 arcade cabinets ran on max out versions of essentially what went into the X68000 at 10 and 16MHz respectively.
GameSack Awww I really want to play Etoile Princesse
GameSack Mr. Bloopy Jelly Boy brought Puty Squad to my mind for some reason.
GameSack Who have rom of Jelly Boy 2 ? :3
GameSack Can you do digitized games plz
GameSack The Jim Power music sounds like Amiga music. 3
GameSack Mr Nutz 2 actually looks really ugly in the graphics department, the original was all lush and dreamlike, the second one seems to consist mostly of boring geometric shapes and primary colors, Mr Nutz own graphic looks less detailed too, and that map just looks awful.
GameSack jim powers background makes me dizzy.
GameSack Earthbound(nes) also known as Eathbound Zero due to the second game being released on the SNES under that same title
GameSack Im looking for a game i play at 90s.. but i dont remember the name.. is a vertical shooting game.. you drive a kind of red tricycle.. you can shoot and jump.. and i remeber the first stage you need to jump some platforms or you fall into the lava... the tricycle shot some red balls ... i dont remember but looks like you can fly or go at the ground.. i sorry for my bad english.. i looking for this like a crazy maniac and i cant stop until i find this game cause i lose alot of coins to this shit :D
GameSack The sega dreamcast is 10 times better than the xbox.
GameSack WELCOME TO THE THUNDER DOME, THE ARMORED PLAYGROUND OF DEATH!!!

GameSack did you steal dbzwii09s tbag
GameSack Its great but you did nail all the minor issues i have with it as well
GameSack lol. Wow. The adapters are awesome.
GameSack Joe and Dave, u are my dudes. I love your vids. It helps me get the past the drudgery of work. Great review. Keep doing what u guys do
GameSack Joe and Dave, you are both awesome. Thanks for another fun video!
GameSack Its like holding the balls of godbest line ever!!
GameSack I think you have to use the AV cable of the Retro Duo because the SNES is used as a power source and the adapter is doing all the job because the GBA has a different architecture and processor than the SNES.Can someone confirm?
GameSack I bought one spur of the moment and I have to say I was really impressed! you guys brought up some real solid points and you will really get some bang for your buck with all the adapters at a relatively low price. Plus who doesnt want to play the original versions of ffII and ffII on the go
GameSack When youre playing via emulation Id rather just have something you didnt have to plug the original cartridges into.Youre not getting a purist true experience anyway so it might as well be a comfortable one.
GameSack Rastan?! I own the original arcade cabinet (and it works)!
GameSack Dang it Joe and Dave, where in the world is my Fan Translation Episode?!?!But in all seriousness, this is an awesome episode.
GameSack What was the song that played at the credits of this episode?
GameSack How does one get the homebrew 32X games...???
GameSack the song from Super Mario Odyssey is actualy Jean Michel Jarre  Chronologie 4
GameSack I managed to pick up a reproduction copy of Secret of Mana 2 for a decent price. Looking forward to playing when I have some free time.
GameSack There is a Kriss Kross game on Sega CD? Wow, I lucked out by not knowing that until now.
GameSack I laughed at how Tonguemans Logic is ripping off the Gunstar Heroes spinning logo xD
GameSack whats the song in the beginning of the video? sound so familiar I know Ive heard it before
GameSack Herwes a few that I love, super Mario 64 the lost stars, megabman x3(fully playable zero from start to finish) and a CRAP load of super Mario world hacks.
GameSack Hahaha is that Persona 4 Arena music playing in the background?
GameSack lol anthony looks like a douchebag in the thumbnail XD
GameSack 18 more videos until 1000!
GameSack play open season for wii single mode
GameSack Did you just call me babe? ...maybe .,..,.
GameSack you guys should play minecraft next wwek
GameSack This episode is funny
GameSack Wow. Such bag. I must have it!
GameSack Did I really just watch this crap for 20 minutes?
GameSack No sports game list is complete without NHL 94, or Punchout, or any Mario sports games.
GameSack Tecmo Bowl Bo Jackson enough said
GameSack lakers vs celtics on genesis, the players are marked by the color of their sneakers
GameSack Oh man...Tommy Lasorda baseball was the best...
GameSack In lakers vs celtics the player you are controlling has black shoes instead of white.
GameSack The Tony Hawk games are my favorite sports games, I have most of them. Also more people need to watch Game Sack!
GameSack Not a big sports fan, but I still found the information interesting. Great job Game Sack!
GameSack I thought Winter Heat was an albino porno
GameSack It would be cool if sometime this month you guys could make a holiday special featuring holiday themed Nintendo and Sega titles. I love all of your videos by the way, Easily this is my favorite game review channel. Thanks for all the great work.
GameSack dakujYa einfach der beste 3 no homo :D
GameSack The whole game is dragons how could you possibly not know Skyrim is about dragons?!
GameSack doesnt konami lose money this way? we all know its all about money for them so...
GameSack Or let YuGiOh have cash prizes.
GameSack http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiAmericas PP The Americas
GameSack I wouldve made it a side event..
GameSack sorry AznEyesWhiteDragon but drafting is NOT like a prerelease. in a prerelease you play sealed format meaning you make a deck out of the cards in the packs u get a draft is an entirely different format. You sit in a group around a table and then you all open your pack at once, then you each select ONE card and put it in a pile for ur deck face down. then you pass the rest of the cards to the next player! and continue this till all the cards are taken. this is a highly skill oriented format and you can not possibly just open good cards as you will only get 2 or 3 cards from the same pack and people will take the second best and so on before that pack comes back to you. this is good for the game, people need to stop blindly hating.
GameSack I really dont know how i feel about this... id rather have my own deck to play with than have a random booster pack cards that may or may not be super broken. i mean i understand because of the dragons, but i mean i still want to play with my own deck even though 9 times outta 10 dragons are going to top.
GameSack A lot of people in these comments seem to think Draft and Sneak Peak Sealed are the same thing.
GameSack Isnt all the top decks Dragon (or something else) Rulers have past their regional anyways? Like I know that might be poorly worded, but what I am trying to say is that the finals will probably be the same kind of deck anyways, and will come down to most likely luck anyways.
GameSack The part where he said SKILLS and YUGIOH in the same sentence. LOL
GameSack A couple of sequels that are better than the originals:Megaman 2Sonic 2 (not hard, considering the original sucks major nuts)Street Fighter 2 (kinda like with Sonic 2, the first was crap)SSBM over SSB64Mario Kart 64Donkey Kong Country 2Sonic Adventure 2 (kinda like the FIRST Sonic, SA1 was god awful. SA2 wasnt great, but there wasnt any of those DAMNED fishing levels, so thats an improvement in my book)
GameSack You said it was Ken Jaffe (15:50) that made God of war. I thought his name was David Jaffe ?
GameSack I know that Super Mario Bros 2 was technically not a Mario game when it was first created, but back when it was released in the US very few people knew that. I did enjoy playing the intended sequel when it did see a US release, but I didnt find it nearly as impressive because it was too similar to the first. It felt more like some kind of expansion pack than a sequel.Katamari Damacy is another game that makes my list. I had MULTIPLE great sequels. Although the core gameplay remains pretty much unchanged, the level design, atmosphere, and music make them all a unique experience from one another. The only one that fell short for me was the xbox version, as some of the level transitions just didnt feel as epic as other versions. Actually, the PSP port was a little lackluster too but mainly because there were not two analog sticks so the control felt gimped. Otherwise it would have been fine.One more game thats worth mentioning is Portal and Portal 2. Although the first game was more of a tech demo, it established some memorable characters and unique puzzleplatformer gameplay that actually worked out great for being a first person game, making it able to become a stand alone title. The 2nd game took everything great about the 1st and added much more to it without changing the overall mechanics. The only bad thing about this type of game is there is very little reason to replay once you solve the puzzles. Because of this the coop mode added is really only fun once, provided neither you nor your friend have ever played it.There are several other sequels Im fond of, but Ive already written a wall of text so Ill save my rambling for another video.
GameSack Ghouls N Ghosts is a hell of a lot better than Ghosts N Goblins.
GameSack System Shock 2? Surely?
GameSack Jurassic Park had the best music out of all the novels Ive ever read.
GameSack Ghouls and Ghosts was a superior sequel to the Ghosts and Goblins.
GameSack How about an episode on the best launch games and another great episode guys.
GameSack mother 2 should be included
GameSack Still one of the sleekest and sexiest consoles out there in my opinion.
GameSack One life left equals one hit in the palm )
GameSack So you suck at gaming, the point is clear, not very funny though..
GameSack WTF Turbo Graph FX in Neo Geo was classic!For all those who cannot get their hands on a NEO GEO the Wii U is a good substitute. There are enough arcade perfect games from Neo Geo available on Wii U through VC app in Wii Mode.. I own about 20 Neo Geo Games including my fovorite Sengoku 3 and Art of Fighting 3.
GameSack Having never owned a neo geo it amazes me that a VHS cassette fits into the cart slot on the system...
GameSack Neo Geo: it only does everything.
GameSack Wait, the NeoGeo has a headphone output? Wow, I didnt know that. Never seen anyone use it before. Systems these days should still have one for private listeninggaming.
GameSack My favorite video game system. Ive got the NeoGeo X and some MVS cart
GameSack 23:00 Listen to the sound she makes when she jumpkicks. Is she coughing up a fur ball or something?
GameSack Why have you cut the fart noise at the start ? being a 35 year old child like I am I miss it :(
GameSack Your show is immensely entertaining. I made a video this morning about snow boarding. Its about two minutes long. Maybe you might give feedback. I used Google video editor. Merci. Bromley 2014 Chad Snowboarding
GameSack like if you hate the new google comment update
GameSack Thanks for calling out Zelda II. I love the series, and I know a lot of ppl are probably pissed about this but Zelda II was always kind meh for me, for the reasons you stated. It almost felt as though it was one of those cases where it started out as something else entirely and ended up a zelda sequel.
GameSack I always wanted The Adventures of Link when I was a kid. I got it now and its on my bucket list, near the end of it.
GameSack Wax that China li in the windows in el viento?
GameSack Im sorry but I cant see anything fun in walking around at a slow pace collecting stuff and avoiding boring enemies in uncreative environments.
GameSack there are some really wrong things in this video...Cool Spot on Mega Drive  Genesis is a lot better than the SNES version : better gameplay better animations higherres... its a great platformer
GameSack sCoDschei Call of Duty

GameSack How about the GBADS remakes of NESSuper Nintendo games, there are quite a few.
GameSack Joe! You really like the Flashback remake? I usually agree with your opinions in these videos, but I cant agree with this. Youre definitely in the minority here. To each their own, though. Either way, great video!
GameSack No mention of Bionic Commando: Rearmed, one of the greatest remakes of all time... ALL TIME!
GameSack Dragon Force is awesome as fuck.
GameSack For a remake of this episode (lame, I know), try covering Tony Hawks Pro Skater and its HD remake from summer 2012.
GameSack Youre right digital releases suck balls. It breaks my heart that they take games away over time. Its like they dont exist now. Thankfully Reshelled sucks balls so you didnt miss much. Im mostly upset that I didnt have the chance to download the TMNT Arcade game when it was on there... (
GameSack How DARE you hate the statue of liberty and the twin towers where were you in 911? Oh wait you gays were having a party and saying thanks to the terrorist. Game sack is stewped end gheeeeey
GameSack There were two remakes that you completely left out:Sega Classics Collection (Golden Axe) for the PS2  The original Golden Axe for the Arcade  Genesis were both awesome. The remake on the PS2 was just plain awful. The stages were extremely long.Double Dragon II: Wander Of The Dragons  This also was a very crappy remake of the original. I liked the NES version much better than the remake of this game.
GameSack I dont love mario all stars. The jumping kinda became floaty. I was actually able to beat the lost levels thanks to the save feature.
GameSack Da habt ihr euch aber ein paar Helden als Ingenieure eingefangen. Wie sie noch im Chat drber diskutieren, wer wo was zu machen hat, weil sie sich offenbar nicht einig waren. Dann kann das ja auch nix werden :D Rahm und Fred haben wohl gar nicht aufgenommen? Schade, das htt ich ganz gern gesehen :(
GameSack The line is pulling the the to screen block, of course an inside blitz will be a sack on the CPU.
GameSack You guys have great t shirts
GameSack Enemy zero was cool. You cant see enemies. You use sound to find them. Very cool.
GameSack What is the song playing at 7:48?
GameSack Great episode and great ending loved Daves face reaction. If I rember correctly Sega only made Deep Fear was due to the fact Capcom didnt put Resident Evil 2 on the Saturn. Even though Capcom had a planed released for RE2 on the Saturn Sega then killed off the Saturn and started working on the Dreamcast so Capcom just waited till the Dreamcast came out.
GameSack I thought Id mention to you... when I was in third grade, I went as Beetlejuice for Halloweener, the cartoon version (with the red shirt inside), rather than the movie one (white shirt inside).
GameSack OH! That Deep Fear game looks real impressive. OH!
GameSack The creepy violins doing the Sega chant on the title card was a great touch :)
GameSack Because! The end parts are shot normally (and with a different camera) to show a difference between the two states of Dave.
GameSack Ah Splatterhouse, one of my favorite series.
GameSack Nice video. Now would you kindly work on episode 22, why I go off to watch episode 21 and would you kindly upgrade something more then your gun, maybe the telekinesis or winter blast.
GameSack LOL that was awesome.
GameSack Dave, odd question but do you play soccer? I kept looking at your shoes lol
GameSack Thats the music from Haunting Ground, isnt it?
GameSack awesome... joe, your basement sure has come a long way. How long ago was this filmed?
GameSack Im never getting that 2:36 back, am I?
GameSack New(ish) stuff from Game Sack and its not even Sunday... feels more like Christmas than Halloween! :)
GameSack Im not sure what I just watched but it was entertaining.
GameSack This was done in 2001? He doesnt look like he aged at all since then.
GameSack Why was this System even released? at the time I thought that the mid90s were going to be about the Saturn. Its like Sega wanted to fail.And as someone who actually had a SCD Drive. I can tell you that it was a POS! it was slow, to load the Games were more expensive then the Cartridge ONLY Games, and offered next to nothing over them bar some really crappy (if only somewhat impressive) FMVs in the early 90s.
GameSack I really like that racing game. It makes me feel like Im back in a 1990s arcade.
GameSack gamers who dont like mortal kombat and doom wtf!!
GameSack 3 good games that you can play in the 32x jajajaja
GameSack Was considering picking up the 32X but I think I might pass on it now that Ive seen what it has to offer. Unless I find it for dirt cheap then Hell Yeah!
GameSack the Space Harrier remains me 3d Wolrd Runner for the Nes! XD
GameSack I had 3 of these pieces of shit when it came out. By the time g
GameSack 32x is the coolest retro console in the world!!!! NOT!!! LMAO Piece of st
GameSack there was literally one game on here worth playing and that was After Burner. I already owned Mortal Kombat and NBA JAM TE on my Sega Genesis so there was no reason to buy this system
GameSack If you go left in the secret entrance instead of going right, you can get to the platform with the badge you saw in the room where you met Punio.
GameSack yep, crash racing for the ps2 was meh compared to the great crash racing for the ps1.....
GameSack I got MY copy of Solar Striker when we went on vacation in Florida too! I thought I was the only person who knew that game.
GameSack You didnt mention Haunting: Starring Polterguy for the Genesis! Thats a shame, because that game really, really deserves more attention. Ive never played, seen, or even heard of any game thats even remotely like it, with the exception of an internet flash game that was clearly inspired by it. You guys absolutely must check it out if youre not familiar with it. You have to run around a house possessing furniture and other things, in order to scare a family out of their home. Damn near every single thing can be possessed, and everything you do possess has its own unique(and often times humorous) animation. The only thing bad about the game is fighting the final boss. If you ever play though it sometime, youll know what I mean.
GameSack A game that desperately needs to be remade is Blast Corps for the N64. That game was so much fun, and would be even more incredible on a modern console
GameSack I have a couple more suggestions if you plan on making another episode like this.Monster Bash (PCDOS) , Diddy Kong Racing (N64), Wave Race (N64), ExtremeG (N64), Target Earth (Genesis), ReVolt (MultiPlat), Tai Fu: Wrath of the Tiger (PS1). Some of these games were ported around or remade but Im not aware of any direct sequels.
GameSack Just remembered a few more Vectorman, Aero the AcroBat  Bubsy. I also remember Blasto being advertised pretty extensively by Sony for the Playstation.
GameSack Nice to see Solar Striker get some attention i enjoy playing through it on occasion and i love the soundtrack to it. I kinda wished Nintendo made a sequel to it.
GameSack Thumbs up for Ristar, I liked that game (despite his voice).
GameSack antz is good whats your problem!
GameSack dude your audio quality (commentary wise voice) is so much better and clearer, bit further away from your mouth and it will be perfection! Alternatively loving the Skyrim serious dude, keep up the great work, also nearly 900 subs!
GameSack Lol loved this play he is beast and should be acknowledged more .. go Broncos!
GameSack It doesnt matter if its a laptop, tablet, desktop (which seems to be what you have), iPhone, those links wouldve worked lol. If you need it, ask man and I can hook you up so you can watch the game. It drives me nuts when I have to hear it, I want to see the action lol.
GameSack hey lewis my gamertag is DouceBagDucky u should add me so we can play together! plez Im a huge fan!!!!! and lol
GameSack Lewis what time do you record?
GameSack The best players dont like playing for Moyes, The worst players like playing for Moyes..How the fuck has Clev got a start every sodding game? Jeez.
GameSack Haha Sir Andy Tate called it.
GameSack Roy Keane even today, would play with more fight and spirit than some of the players did against SwanseaPlay for the badge FFS, its a privilege, too many okay players in this squad not enough great ones
GameSack Listen to this guy, put me in charge
GameSack Giggs  the chosen one..
GameSack Its not just about Moyes. The team is just not good enough. Let Moyes sign some players so he can get his own team, not Fergies team. Every new manager wants his own players. Moyes is not an magician like Ferguson. Let the man build his own team, then the results will come. What Fergie did with this team was excellent. I gotta say. Im not an United fan, but what Fergie got out of the players was impressive.. Because, its not very impressive any more. Ferdinand is over the top. RvP is back with his usual injuries (Arsenal history), Rooney is great and he is the teams nr.1 at the moment. Carrick is good. Rafael is getting better. But on the other side of the defense you have Evra thats aging and getting bader and bader. This United team needs 2 or 3 new world class players that can go straight into the first team. A boxtobox mdifielder, attacker, and Central defender.
GameSack What a clown this guy is typical plastic scummer
GameSack giggs as united coach im not so sure but i bet the players would enjoy there football alot more and give him 100
GameSack this guy is 100 right, there is literally no flair and passion in our team but personally I am backing moyes till the end of the season because I think the players need to get behind him more but they cant if we dont have that winning mentality as we used to for the past 26 years...
GameSack Thats reminds me of the Sack Game against Auburn in 2005
GameSack As a Alabama fan I say that was sad watch him crawl like a run over dog and the saddest part was none of him teammates checked on him or helped him up.
GameSack One of the greatest games Ive seen Bama play. We struggled in the first half but completely dominated the second half. The 4 sacks back to back, Mettenberger army crawling, TJ Yeldon and McCarron tearing LSU up and Nick Saban jumping into AJs arms!! 3PEAT RTR
GameSack Mettenberger deserved every hit that he got on that series....loved it!! If youre gonna talk shit and give the fans taunting hand signals going into halftime then he deserves to be dragging his ass off the field. RTR!!!!
GameSack LOL Mett throwing his helmet.you just got PROCESSED
GameSack My Aggies are trash this year smh
GameSack Great call Rod Bramblett and Stan White. Stan is pumped! Great win against a great team. War Eagle
GameSack Itd probably be best if you didnt comment...
GameSack No videos for three days? I know why. Fuck you guys for working your employees like slaves. That poor girl quit and made your bosses look like an asshole. When will companies realize the best asset is talent. Treat your talent right and they treat you good in return. Shit on your employees and they dont stick around. Fire your managers.
GameSack thx for posting so quickly as always
