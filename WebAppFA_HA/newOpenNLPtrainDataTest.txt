TopGear Lotus F1 on track driver POV

TopGear although this car is fast, but it looks very ugly...
TopGear When can they try the koenigsegg agera r or koenigsegg agera one:1?
TopGear 2,000,000 for a Lamborghini Sesto Elemento? Seems reasonable.
TopGear OMG !!! Damn thats THE car to have!
TopGear Ugly and usless i go for the porsche 918 or the ferrari LaFerrari
TopGear I would pick the maclaren p1 over the sesto elemento
TopGear Theres something missing :( oh yeah JAMES AND THAT OTHER GUY WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THEM ANY ONE ???
TopGear My 99 geo metro would give it a good run for its money.........
TopGear The way they introduce cars amazes me so much..
TopGear Unreal. I have driven 4 different Bulls, and this is next on my list...
TopGear Looks like it already caught fire in the beginning of the video! HA!
TopGear it proble cost 345,0000 who would by it
TopGear What episode is this?
TopGear Whats the song at the beginning of the video ?
TopGear its gaiest lamorghini
TopGear Supercars are just getting more and more ridiculous every year.
TopGear Sailing, Really boreing!
TopGear Surprised nobody tried a fan boat style rig!
TopGear Happy Birthday, Jeremy! :D
TopGear haha I never realised they used mirror sails on mays carboat
TopGear I hope the guys still keep the show going on because I want to see more of them do more funny stunts and try new cars
TopGear Happy b day Clarkson!
TopGear Haha one of my favourites!
TopGear Man, this looks fun. I have fun watching them have fun.
TopGear Possibly one of the best challenges its a shame they dont do these still.
TopGear still funny no matter how many times i watch
TopGear Toyota carboat.With Honda motor.
TopGear This is THE classic challenge
TopGear this video is VERY VERY old why did there reupload it anyway?
TopGear One of the best challenges they ever did!
TopGear Shouldve been bailing at the front so there is more weight is the back so it puts the nose up
TopGear I think they love theirs job : D
TopGear I need more wind! loool
TopGear One of the funniest bits in tv history. :D
TopGear James shouldve had a set of oars.
TopGear 5:47 Eloquently put James. XD
TopGear classic.........jeremy may and hamond
TopGear I assume that most ladas broke because the lack of maintenance and people that bought it assumed since its cheap, it wont require any maintenance at all.They are so simple to work on and maintain but i guess that brits are lazy.
TopGear Interesting video.Thanks!
TopGear WICEJ INFORMACJI O TOPGEAR POLSKA:https:www.facebook.comTopGearPolskahttp:www.topgear.com.plZimowe Porsche Driving Experience w Finlandii pod okiem Waltera Rhrla.
TopGear YES! THIS is what the future needs! The old models look with the modern technology! Thank you SingerI hope they will do it with the Lamborghini Diablo or the Ferrari F40!
TopGear Ferrari is way better
TopGear I was expecting Richard Hammond doing this lol
TopGear One of these days the Brits really need to consult a Science book or a dictionary, there is only one I in the word Aluminum.
TopGear You knowIm surprised Top Gear didnt do a drag race between the two acrs. that would have been interesting.
TopGear James May can drift !!! OMGGG !!!!!
TopGear A love letter to a car.
TopGear Hah! I have the same sweater.
TopGear Is it me or was Captain Slow performing a powerslide? Hahaha... The Singer 911 is simply the best.
TopGear James May is a true gentlemen.
TopGear but this car has a PDK gearbox, not a 7 speed manual...
TopGear I love that they kept the same look if it isnt broken why fix it right? Such a nice car it has an aggressive stance i love it. I wish I could own one :(
TopGear sireis i dont even know how they got that wrong.
TopGear this is captain slow...
TopGear If only I had money...
TopGear Too bad the first one built was sold by the owner only six months after he got it....he wanted it to be the first...and didnt care about what went in to it....shame on you.....
TopGear Turn10Studios We want this in Forza 5
TopGear all porsches are bad and they should feel bad.
TopGear Goosebumps just by looking at it... its beautiful!
TopGear Absolutely amazing! The Singer 911 is simply a work of art. One of the best things that could happen to a 911 is being done as a Singer. Great work Top Gear for uploading this video! Now please the Lamborghini Aventador Sesto Elemento next! Please! And keep the original music for gods sake.
TopGear did anyone notice that the orange car was a s13.5
TopGear Now to bring in the Stigs Japanese cousin this season...
TopGear He made it look so easy
TopGear So damn cool. Make them regular guests!
TopGear D1 Drifters are the best ever.
TopGear wanna see real drif look up in youtube arabic drift or libyan drfit ) enjoy
TopGear top gear japan anyone?
TopGear this video is really old
TopGear I bet that Mr. Kazama can drift with a shopping trolley
TopGear That laugh at 3:33 ....
TopGear It looks like the Pontiac GTO
TopGear I love the nissan silvia s14, it is my favorite drift car!
TopGear I think if you want to make a drifting video, use a Toyota Sprinter Trueno Apex GT AE86. Please excuse any errors in the first sentence, but its a true classic.
TopGear The Vauxhall Monaro is simply a re badged Holden Monaro
TopGear are there american versions of these cars?
TopGear awesomecheck my clip pleaseAUDI QUATTRO 2.7 TWIN TURBO 250BHP SOUNDS AWESOME
TopGear In United States we call it the Pontiac GTO
TopGear why the front side of 240sx is replaced by 1 from silvia?
TopGear 3:33 so funny stopit onthe .
TopGear More d1drifting please
TopGear finally Top Gear DRIFT!!!
TopGear LOL Kazama! For a second I thought I was watching watching Best Motoring.
TopGear personally I find american muscle cars easier to drift with than japanese modified ones because american muscle cars produce alot of wheelspin and have no traction control so u can just brake and turn in the wheels in the opposite direction your going just like in pixars cars turn right to go left
TopGear eccomi  !! thanks  e continua grande ..
TopGear Anche meglio grazie mille! Continua cos
TopGear This is just stupid though, i find it hard to believe that it can cut grass at that speed anyway. So its just made to break a record. Quite silly that it would be a well known brand that did that and not some hobby mechanic or whatever.
TopGear i guess it feels a bit like a quad car
TopGear If Mario Kart was real, I would use this.. I can just mow the bananas on the race track lol
TopGear it kinda stopped being a mower a long time ago
TopGear So according to the description, this is the Stig!
TopGear I wish they wouldnt have tried to make this so inspirational. Almost made it not watchable.
TopGear Ah put a 350 in one then through wheelie bars on it and call it done.
TopGear take that to the inwood 500 in canada trapter racing friggin rights
TopGear use slick tires..might go faster
TopGear It has to be a fully functioning lawn mower to qualify for the record. So I would think beast is totally capable of cutting your Dads lawn in 30 seconds flat lol
TopGear out of my way fools...gotta get to other end of my yard in under 1 sec D
TopGear Would like to see that go around the Top Gear test track.
TopGear Not so much civics but more so NSXs and S2000s. Oh youre right though. Just terrible cars. In response to another post, it does have a working blade. It is driven by I believe two electric motors rather than a normal setup driven by the engine. It has to be able to work as a mower to meet the Guinness criteria.
TopGear way to dramatic... just show the damn lawnmower already
TopGear oh em gee, much better than the murican one u gaiz huhuh
TopGear HONDA  Y U NO VTEC MOWER?
TopGear Next goal. 200kmh on a mower. Go.
TopGear any idea what was the time lap?
TopGear 1:16 at the point I would have start to shat myself!
TopGear Ive been waiting to see this thing in action, thanks for the video!
TopGear Hopefully its faster than the Porsche 918 for Jeremys sake.
TopGear 01:11.8 my prediction
TopGear This is totally insane!
TopGear Incredible video of the ridiculously amazing P1! I cant imagine how much fun it was to sit in the passengers seat with Mr. Goodwin at the controls. Definitely looking forward to the POV video.
TopGear Amazing!!! Since the MP412C has done it in 1.16,2 sec., then I guess, it made it in 1.12,6!!
TopGear That sound is amazing!
TopGear Amazing Video! Amazing Car! Amazing Driver!
TopGear i was so happy when the music stopped so we could listen to the symphony this machine produces. what an insane car!!
TopGear I knew it! You were on the Top Gear track!
TopGear Hey Doc, did you get to time the lap?
TopGear How does it compare to the Huayra?
TopGear Did you use Sony HDR AS30 ??I bought HDR AS100V recently. Its great.
TopGear 1:10 with a passenger. pretty quick car
TopGear grande sei unico che si impegna veramente
TopGear Top Gear Live 2014 Moscow 2014 Full  2014       !
TopGear This is actually a fitting analogy. Jezza is Kirk, May is Spock and Hammond being the practical sort of fellow, is Scotty. :D
TopGear HoverVan Havoc  Top Gear  Series 20  BBC
TopGear It make me cry is so funny.you cant replace them in any way!!
TopGear The guy in the middle looks like a morph of Hugh Jackman and David Tennant. Hehe
TopGear Lmaoo man lml love these guys
TopGear lol, Back to the studio
TopGear This is why top gear uk is better.
TopGear YOU PILLOCK!!!!! lol.
TopGear love the driving, you had to try going up it was the fun thing to do.
TopGear A bunch of idiots. And I watched it!!
TopGear lloll kill engine hover van hihihi
TopGear Its really funny!!!!!!
TopGear Want to get itunes, amazon gift cards and paypal cash?use tiny. ccpdown tiny. ccfcash
TopGear Who cares if its staged, what matters is that it is entertaining and funny so the people who hate can go watch 5th gear and wear your suit and tie not your clothes you feel confutable in.
TopGear Power Power Power... Powerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr POWER POWER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lol
TopGear that would be something jeremy would do
TopGear LMAO!! ...and with that, back to the studio! HA!
TopGear Perhaps that rear and center differential would benefit from a downshift  weightshift into the corner to kick out the rear wheels rather than locking up the rear wheels with the emergency brake. Not so great on your street designed AWD car.
TopGear reminds me on toyota g86 and subaru brz
TopGear How do you have an LFA video that doesnt have an LFA exhaust note? Bad form.
TopGear No topgear anymore for now? :( When will season 21 resume?!?!?!Or when will season 22 start?!!?! I really hate this season obly had 7 episodes...
TopGear A 15 second preroll commercial before a 48 second video with all but no content. Thank you YouTube and top Gear. :(
TopGear This and the GTR are my dream cars. But this video was shit. I would be better informed by looking at a Wikipedia page than this.
TopGear Pretty slow compared to other super cars honestly.
TopGear only 6 mph faster than a gtr but 4 times the price, gtr wins again on value.....
TopGear i didnt see the engine?!?
TopGear It cost as much as a lambo but the numbers are just not there
TopGear And thank you...for designing me ol frs )
TopGear I like this car for being rare but in all honesty, its pretty slow around the track. I seen an all out battle on a track in japan (japanese racing video) and it got smoked by gtrs , vettes and other stock vehicles..
TopGear Georgeous but overpriced
TopGear Lack of cup holders. Do not want.
TopGear what did honda do in response ..... a lawnmower ... epic
TopGear was told by title under the hood, so watched for under the hood view.. I was dooped
TopGear Gimme bck that 60sec of my life.49sec for this vid and 11sec for typing this cmmnt.damn you.
TopGear If Lexus would just utilize the exact same engine with a hybrid electric motor and a new double clutch transmission, the results would be intense
TopGear I would buy this over ferrari and lamborghini and this car not overrated by clarkson because it really is an amazing car made by highest quality japanese manufacturer in 10 years of development and clarkson have driven 10 times more cars than you do
TopGear Is it just me or when i see a video called under the hood I would like to see under the hood?
TopGear My favourite car to come out of Japan  the NSX is a legend  so was the driver that made it famous
TopGear how could you manage to ruin this video so bad? stupid music misleading title
TopGear Can someone send me a pink slip for this car. Thank you in advance.
TopGear Title of a video Under the Hood literally doesnt show under the hood.
TopGear Happy 700th video, Top Gear!
TopGear The programs come in Japan! That s just too cool Lamborghini after all
TopGear A rare breed maybe, but an old one now. This came from the last episode in Season 6.
TopGear 2:34 Thats the song JP was listening to in his office in Grandmas Boy haha.
TopGear and thats why top gear U.S. version sucks ass. Hammond had the balls to go into the bull event. No American Top Gear Hollywood Attention whore would have the guts to do what Hammond did. Thumbs up for U.K. Top Gear!
TopGear its a shame the original murcielago hasnt aged well at all :(
TopGear Those are old chapters?
TopGear stupid advertiser keeps popping out everytime i press the thumbnail anf all it does is loading aghghghg
TopGear I think the name murcilago is because the side vents open up like bat wings at high speed
TopGear Not so expensive and yet more beautiful than many other exotics costing a hundred more than this one.
TopGear Love the Lambo, hate the Keystone commercial.
TopGear this channel is like DAVE.
TopGear This thing still stops everyone when it screams by and always will!
TopGear I havent felt this alive since..this morning when i was chased by a bull actually. hahah!
TopGear Viva espaa!! Y top gear!!
TopGear Murcielago... Bat... Most Lambos are named after bulls that got pardoned in bullfighting for being exceptionally brave, its like a a bullfighting hall of fame I guess. Diablo, Gallardo, Aventador, Reventn... All famous spanish bulls. They get to live the rest of their lives being carefully taken care of and breeding. That is why this one is called Murcielago, a bull that was allowed to walk out of the ring alive in 1879.
TopGear I wonder when they are going to get their hands on a c7
TopGear Well done, cool video! : )
TopGear ..So here I am!I died.
TopGear Too easy.if you run out of ideas for a show,just grab a Lamborghini.had work ehhh?
TopGear I remember when this came out... it was years ago.
TopGear New RS7 vs E63 AMG Top Gear
TopGear Questa lavevo gi vista. C lhai quella in cui provano lalfa 4 c?
TopGear Puoi mettere anche le stagioni vecchie come la 567 che fanno crepare dalle risate? :D
TopGear Top Gear 18x02 ITA HD Prima Parte
TopGear Ci crediate o no, io quel giorno ero a Piazza di Spagna con mia moglie, ed ho assistito a tutta la scena...la cosa bislacca  che NON LI CONOSCEVO ANCORA e mi sono avvicinato credendo fosse un film....ora a rivederli.....fantastici
TopGear BBC cant make good shows and as one might expect, cant make good games too. Who takes a dump with the door open while being filmed. And what kind of a moron shows this on an ad.
TopGear How come weve never seen the Stig and his cousin in the same place?
TopGear you need to put cousin after teenage in the description
TopGear I name this ship... Flush
TopGear Stig on that thug life status lol
TopGear why do they upload a video 23 times?
TopGear The game is absolute total shit!! Bad copy of subway surfers.
TopGear Im playing this game way too much :) Highscore: 1084022.
TopGear Its Alex Brundle! LOLThe Stig has a LOT of damn cousins...
TopGear whats the name of the song in this video?
TopGear SiLveRsLidErZz you do know schumi is in coma right now?
TopGear LOL the low riding xD
TopGear I have this on my Nokia Lumia 620 :D
TopGear Fake..Im the onliest Stig
TopGear Stigs Teenage Cousin must have just got out of prison advertizing his ass the way they do in ((Prison))
TopGear The games... meh, just another clone really. But this this add is 100x better.
TopGear non ti ringrazier mai abbastanza per aver messo on line le puntate di top gear:) davvero grazie mille!
TopGear La differenza tra noi e gli inglesi  tutta in questa puntata. Amen
TopGear Top Gear 20x06 ITA HD Seconda Parte
TopGear Looks to be a computer game
TopGear i couldnt help but just drop my jaw at that car holy shit!
TopGear From today onward, I will never accept a drag race challenge from someone who claims he will race me with an electric car.
TopGear Hybrids and Electric vehicles. Why do they have to come in hideous colors andor designs? I mean even affordable sedans and SUVs that are available in petrol and hybrid versions have quite a few differences between them the hybrid being the uglier one with ugly tail lights and ridiculous decals and badging.
TopGear Im more curious as to why they would paint it in that ghastly green?..
TopGear too late Tesla Roadster is the 1st battery powered super car.
TopGear Dear Top Gear, i reckon iMercedes owe me an old Black.I have sorted out the battery range dilemma.Firstly trailers can be towed BY any iMercedes.Trailers can be any size.Replacing consumer envy and anger for petrol with just an oversized car trailer.So the media and advertising executives will be happy.The trailer will carry,SOLAR PANELS, enough to supply a domestic house or recharge in continuity a iMercedes.With enough amperage charge to allow the iMercedes to work all night long.The extra sized trailer can also work as an advertising bill board.Paying for the car.The excess power when not needed i.e. when parked can be sold back to the power companies also paying for the nights meal or lease on the street parking.Ideally the engineered trailer when parked would double as a street or off street car garage etcAla batiman engineering.Yeah thats way to hard eh.Regards Peter.Nice change of pace.
TopGear ILL take the V8 anytime, I dont think electric Cars are gonna be perfect, at least not for now, and they are also too Expensive.
TopGear Wen gas runs out Ill make more for the actual cars not those stupid plug in remote control cars
TopGear Im sorry but that Mercedes is ugly. I prefer the sleek body lines of a Corvette or a Lambo.
TopGear electric cars are cool but the sounds are not.. :)
TopGear I thought the first electric super car was the fisker karma
TopGear Petroleum Companies would love to see those Electic Supercars Disappear
TopGear This thing shall gone dark when jit by EMP
TopGear electric is best but as always the damn thing goes flat , dont understand why they cant come up with a way to make it self charge while it drives .
TopGear surely mercedes made the petrol version slower on purpose. mercedes must be big on propaganda hype for the electric now. the fastest cars arent electric. as much of our electricity comes from burning fossil fuels and the fuel is transported using tanks running with petrol etc its not exactly any better. they really need to get those super charging batteries (few mins) ready soon.
TopGear Approaching ... approaching .. APPROACHING  !!!!!
TopGear how much mileage you do with the electric one??
TopGear Per caso riusciresti a caricare anche quelli delle stagioni precedenti alla 19?
TopGear Top Gear 20x05 ITA HD Seconda Parte
TopGear That drag race sounds bad... Late shifting...
TopGear i put i like! good im writing in English but Im Italian! Thanks a lot!10
TopGear la sesto elemento ragazzi  qualcosa che fa spruzzare da tutte le parti 3
TopGear Spero che i traduttori italiani siano andati a confessarsi dopo aver dichiarato che le 911 hanno 6 cilindri in linee a cambio manuale a 7 marce......
TopGear Grandeee aspetto la seconda parte continua cosiii
TopGear Quando pubblichi l altra?
TopGear 6 secondi ??? Un 50cc scoter fa 6 secondi
TopGear 0100 in 6 secondi? Lhanno confusa con uno scooter :D ?
TopGear This Aston Martin is damn sexy...like every Aston Martin xD
TopGear Its called bonnet. Cars dont have hoods.
TopGear If I were really wealthy. This would be my sports car of choice. Not a Lambo, not a ferrari. Theres a certain elegance to Astons thats just amazingly sexy to me.
TopGear 6L V12 only 517 bhp?? And 060mph only 4.1seconds?? Thats very disappointing.
TopGear i like music very like please give me that music ()
TopGear This car is breathtaking...but is way overpriced at 195000 pounds
TopGear Awww poop. I got all excited I thought they were going to actually show us what its made of
TopGear Take a gander at the new Camaro ZL1 or the Z28. More HP and less .
TopGear This car does not have 517bhp... It has 565. Cmon Top Gear youre meant to know these things.
TopGear Isnt the engine just 2 ford 3.0 v6s stuck together?
TopGear To be able to see the Top Gear Trio in my country seems impossible. Maybe someday this small Indonesia will be visited by Sir Clarkson, Sir Hammond and the famous and elegant Sir James. Someday. :)
TopGear Its good but..... gtr is better
TopGear i had to watch a 30 second ad to watch a 41 second video... this is my life.
TopGear Stig standing in front of a GTR... Pretty much explains everything.
TopGear The ford Taurus looks like this of course this dime came way first.
TopGear Omg, I bet this video was made by alltime10s...
TopGear Well thats enough porn for today.
TopGear Steering wheel looks outdated
TopGear Minchia ma la spagna  messa peggio di noi!!
TopGear Ma Jeremy ospita sempre attori brutti ?
TopGear Top Gear 20x03 ITA HD Seconda Parte
TopGear They got the gay mustang
TopGear I love that little lotus. Why dont more manufacturers take out all the heavy electronics on luxuries or do it for a particular lightweight model of the regular model? Imagine how much faster the 86 triplets would be if they made a light version where they took out the AC, leather seats, power windows, rear seats etc. That thing might be as quick as this lotus.
TopGear Sushi vs a Hamburger.. I see what you did there!
TopGear Hmm now lets see a race between a Hennessey Venom GT and an Aston Martin. Seems fair doesnt it.
TopGear Maybe not quite fair to compare the Exige to one of the worst drivers car on the planet Stig or no
TopGear I dont know why. but I dont like Lotus at all. its a good little car thoe
TopGear british engineering my ass . Toyota motor , Mitsubishi suspension ,and parts from other manufactures , sound like a parts bucket
TopGear Even when I was playing need for speed most wanted I never had to hit the breaks when using the lotus even at max speed.
TopGear You guys hate on America to much
TopGear try a 2015 roush mustang vs lotus
TopGear Michigan is pronounced Mishigan
TopGear Lets see it up against a vette or a venom not a muscle car
TopGear The point is: power and big engine doesnt mean everything .
TopGear comparing with a 10 year old car  fail.
TopGear Shelby GT500 vs. Lotus Exige
TopGear 126 dislikes equals 126 mustang owners!
TopGear Haha its a toy car and I want one
TopGear what are u trying to prove when you race a lotus like this against a mustang?? what is the challenge?
TopGear did u guys use the smallest mustang motor u could find wtf???
TopGear They should have tested it against the Leguna Seca edition of the mustang.The Mustang is in a completley different category as the Lotus is, Mustang isnt designed for corners stock from the factory, the lotus however is. The Leguna Seca edition IS however...
TopGear Not a very good comparison. Those two cars arent really direct competitors. Id take the lotus but it does cost twice as much.
TopGear That Hotel California BGM.
TopGear That style Mustang was so nasty. I have a 5.0 now... but only because of the changes, I never liked any of the retro crap Ford did. I never liked how doggy they made their cars when we had the 93 and newer Fbodies as an alternative with great looks and amazing LT1s and LS1s. The 2015 Mustang is going to be even better, and what does Camaro do for 2015, they take away the cool tail lights and give it granny tail lights because they gave the Stingray tail lights that maybe had a 5 similarity to the cool Camaro tail lights. Oh yea this was between Lotus and Mustang.
TopGear hahaha anything is better than a Ford, even if the stig is driving it
TopGear the guys were in the highly secretive topgear planning facility thinking of ways to shit on american cars. then jeremy thought oh gee why dont we put up a very quick, extremely impractical, overpriced lotus up against a mustang GT! sounds totally fair right?
TopGear Pubblica tutto quello che hai su top gear ita anche le serie precedenti ogni video hai un like assicurato da parte mia grandeeee
TopGear Lubi w Waszych filmach t jako wykonania. To Was wyrnia od innych. PS Co to za muzyka w tle?

TopGear pretty sure you could drift with no hands!
TopGear Wow!!quando carichi le prossime?

TopGear Ciao ma da dove le prendi?:)
TopGear Top Gear 20x01 ITA HD Prima ParteEcco la Ventesima Stagione! ITA HD
TopGear 4:21 WTF?!?!?! ASSASSINS CREED 3 SOUNDTRACK?!?! :O
TopGear Damn right that Fezza is a little bit more special, but 0:11 ... OMG. That BLUE!! 0.oI know its not really right to have a Ferrari in any other colour than red... or yellow... or black... but one in that blue would make me so dang happy! )
TopGear One of the best episodes right here. Street circuit, those 4 cars, and that Top Gear humor.
TopGear what was the Soundtrack or Song playing when Jeremy was driving ?
TopGear Haha when jeremy is driving uts the ac3 theme D
TopGear Assassins creed music in the McLarens lap lol 4:20
TopGear They say that the speedhump is very... inquisitive.
TopGear Love the ending lol Ferrari is just king end of story
TopGear props to bradley cooper XD
TopGear The most perfect supercar in this day in age is definitely the McLaren
TopGear No one looks as funny as May with an Arai helmet on..... no one.
TopGear They are still using the wheel in the other side, D
TopGear assassins creed 3 music lol
TopGear Am I the only one how noticed the Assassins Creed theme here?
TopGear Tail slide.....I call that drifting
TopGear Ferrari 458 Italia is my favourite car. :DDD
TopGear Nobody expects the Spanish speed hump
TopGear Funny as every episode :D
TopGear Definitely one of my all time favorite Top Gear segments
TopGear where exactly was it filmed?
TopGear Take the Jag, no matter what
TopGear thrilling episode. beautiful cars. this is one of my favourite things about top gear...
TopGear Circuito de Sir Francis Drake good one!
TopGear Whats the song that starts at 3:12 ?
TopGear james may got into 3rd 0.0
TopGear Circuit De Francis Drake lolol.So funny, i wonder if the Spanish see the funny side of it lol.
TopGear See 9:14. Not a very pleasing sight.. front left Tyre is about to burst.
TopGear Hey Jeremy that bloke that got his gentleman sausage cut off and thrown out of the window of a speeding car, on the A1 should take a trip to Russia so he can grow a new one! See your show really is educational and provides public service announcements!Good on ya crack on mate!
TopGear Last laugh is on James, I think. Considering that he loves Ferrari and owns one, he is probably the one who is going to review La Ferrari.(Now the only thing we need is the three of them going up against The Stig andor Sabine Schmidt in one of the best petrolonly cars and see who goes the fastest around the Nordschleife :P)
TopGear mclaren is spelt wrong in description
TopGear Hi Jennifer Now say you dont like Porsche again,
TopGear I honestly was a little disappointed witg the special. It was a really cool idea, but some of the pranks were obviously fake, and after seeing those it sorta ruined the rest of the episode.
TopGear Chernobyl was boring. Anthony Bourdain was there long before these chaps.
TopGear my god i love these GUYs!!! awesome, awesome people.
TopGear Its going to be a sad sad day once they retire from the show.
TopGear i loved chernobyl,,it was very interesting and what i was interested in!
TopGear Hammonds attire was atrocious on the two part Christmas Special.

TopGear Top Gear 19x05 ITA HD Prima Parte
TopGear I suspect theres hundreds of hours of Gran Turismo behind this success. But he still had to drive it for realz ) Spoiler: He beat everyone
TopGear Hi Jennifer Now say you dont like Porsche again,
TopGear Im still alive, anyone want my recipe?
TopGear Sounds too artificial for me this man!
TopGear Casey Chamblin Yes we do pronounce the e in Porsche.
TopGear This should have been titled, Is Aaron Pauls Breaking, Bad?
TopGear Why dont you guys try out the Chrysler srt8
TopGear My Bitch can only get better....Soon hell be Breaking Good(meaning less) and riding that apex like a doubleloaded crackpipe.....YeeHa!!!!
TopGear Look at the piece of crap they gave him to drive. I wouldnt have stopped til it was ready for the crusher lol
TopGear Did he really just mispronounce Koenigsegg?
TopGear some say that blue color on his visor is from smoking too much blue meth
TopGear I love the behind the scenes bits. Make more!!
TopGear Jesse, weve got work to do
TopGear Yeah, Breaking BITCH!
TopGear Jesse (the character) must be a shit driver simply by his choices of vehicles... at the end, his smiling ass should have stalled it.
TopGear braking bad is awesome,Aaron Paul is my favourite actor
TopGear this dude is such a jerk off.
TopGear I watched the episode. Hes now 1 on the board.
TopGear Hi Jennifer Now say you dont like Porsche again,
TopGear You cant close the roof on the Ferrari while moving? That blows...
TopGear I dont understand at the last part. Why does Richard need to wait at the line where Jeremy and James can go 1st? o.0
TopGear I think that these cars can go a bit faster than in the video,cant they?
TopGear I thought it was going to be slot cars
TopGear another episode of Top Gear and another proof why it has so many fans (myself included). just when you think theyve run out of ideas and it is going to be something predictable (like a simple drag race), they come up with the funniest and coolest ways to spice it up :)
TopGear Not that I come from Europe  but Europe looks so much cooler than the rest of the world. The World is beautiful and interesting and Ive been on 4 continents so far myself but  nothing beats Europe. So old, artistic, cultural and hi tech in the same time.Even when there was the Bosnian War in Eastern Europe  the soldiers hid in 1000 years old monasteries and fought at the Roman walls of Dubrovnik(Kings Landing from GOT). Damn.
TopGear pay attention ...they never put the 911 turbo s to compete with these cars ,cuz they know the Porsche will beat all of them!
TopGear I mean most of them in that fact......yes hurried and corrected my self haha
TopGear AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Jeremy is the best! :)
TopGear How did they get the whole airport shut down? Since Madrid Airport is huge
TopGear This airport was made by corruption, its completely abandoned. So it can use like a track and top gear spanish version will be founded )

TopGear its like a toy cars in the thumbnail
TopGear The McLaren MP412C Spider is amazing!!
TopGear Id still take the Ferrari
TopGear Why is James and Jeremy wearing the same shirt?
TopGear the one who came up with that roof up and down race is a genius.
TopGear review the Devel Sixteen and race it against a Bugatti
TopGear Verso che ora lo carichi?

TopGear Very Good Episode!!!!
TopGear 150k for the gismo gtr? wow i was guessing a LOT more
TopGear Yo wheres that cute German chick? Yeah, Derek d, I dig your smile and like that hair part...but thats no substitute for da laDEs. ). Oh yeah, and kick as cars put your smile into third...Erikas voice drops you into fourth...hmmm hey fourth isnt bad...Love the show, great info, entertaining...thanks FLD team! Great production!
TopGear need for speed.....I hope the hell not
TopGear Ill get the Juan car instead which i can afford thank you
TopGear Considering that the GTR is my favorite car, Im going to need new fucking eyes after seeing that GTR Convertible. To whomever created that monstrosity, fuck you!
TopGear demander11 same here the Nismo GTR is an ugly tuner car the 911 Turbo is a beautiful car
TopGear The Vyron hit 273 point something but it didnt do it on the way back at the same speed so f u commenter of the weak. Thats why they have to do the run in both directions!!
TopGear its clear that my scrotum is
TopGear Oscars for FLD in ALL OF THE CATEGORIES

TopGear Ha Erica almost said twerk instead of torque!!!! that was funny :)
TopGear That dbag can never replace Paul Walker.
TopGear The Koenigsegg 1t1 was ordered and built as a track car and not some tuning project like the Venom seems to be. The new technologies developed for the 1t1 will also go into the next gen Agera model. It even has 3D printed titanium parts to save weight. (And the 3D printing technology comes from another swedish company with customers such as Airbus, Boeing and NASA)Do not underestimate us swedes :)Cant wait to see some videos of the 1t1!
TopGear I am pretty sure the Hennessey is not a production car sorry americans
TopGear FYI D squared , he already went on top gear and he was the fastest star in a reasonably priced car with a 1:44.7 seconds. Great show by the way.
TopGear Just saying that Erica has a sexy voice OK let her know
TopGear he hit the 500 letter comment limit.
TopGear I think Need for Speed the movie is trying to become like FATF but i think they will do something wrong and everyone will hate the move and they will go back to making games :D
TopGear Great episode, no bs, no bias, just the straight facts, why cant more car shows be like FLD? Great job guys, ohh and you did pretty good too Derek D...BITCH!
TopGear Yes I think need for speed will turn into a ff type of franchise because I have a feeling that it will have that eee........ kind of ending just like the first ff had and I think NFS will be a strong contend for a best movie of the year in my

TopGear 620aaRRRRRR! for racing
TopGear Damn the rain this year!
TopGear how many people were narrating the lap as the stig drove?
TopGear Look at that little car hip hopping on the track. Id drive with a megawatt smile.
TopGear It almost sounds like a snowmachine.
TopGear The new Stig is Gordon Shedden.
TopGear Never knew James has a lady in his life
TopGear anyone else still think the latest stig is tiff?
TopGear For the guys out here who dont know, the old stig used to be schumacher but now he is in a comma, so they got a little teenager as the stig.
TopGear Did the Stig miss a gear? 1:50
TopGear Nothing but wet lol. Cool clip of the Stig getting sideways.
TopGear Watching the lap in 1080p is glorious!
TopGear Please do the lap again in the dry! This was going to be exciting!
TopGear James, you could always just buy a wind screen from Caterham...could you not?
TopGear That looks like its better than sex...
TopGear Impressive driving!!!
TopGear Just great! NOT ! what was the time for the 620R, how did it stack up?Seems you video was a bit clipped at the end. Am i right???
TopGear Haha, Id love to see someone go on Forza 5 and use the Ceterham on the Top Gear track and trie to beat his time!
TopGear I wish this was how the new F1 cars would drive
TopGear Uhhhhhh, THAT SOUND !Trumpets of Jericho, you jelly ?
TopGear I LOVE this type of videos! keep it up topgear!
TopGear Still got this on video I will never sell it
TopGear Quite informative. Thanks for the share
TopGear A45 AMG, Launch Control?
TopGear Un mi piace  dobbligo! :)
TopGear Weird, but I like it....I think.
TopGear I would gladly accept it if you guys donate the subaru, dont put them on fire.
TopGear WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT
TopGear Am I the only one that thinks this is a waste of time?
TopGear Nice slow mo fire but Subaru abuse is a crime against nature!
TopGear I would like to see how the cars are made
TopGear Im confused as to why there is a Subaru doing donuts while on fire..
TopGear This is coming to barbados literally a week after I leave I wish I knew Im here now
TopGear BEAUTIFUL..........nuff said!
TopGear What im wondering is, what colour is that subaruss front, i mean at start its blue and in the end its white
TopGear theyre really on fire!
TopGear never had the chance to see rhis :
TopGear I would rather watch my own videos than pay to see this live.
TopGear Sitting in bars eating crisps. Nice!! Haha.
TopGear I think its kinda stupid to do such a show in front of bunch of people.. They are best at making Top Gear which is watched all over the world from millions of people. The best show in the world :)
TopGear Top gear always brings the original stuff
TopGear When did Johnny Sins start doing Top Gear?
TopGear This guy is awesome but I hate how many episodes on TV we get each year. Seems like Top Gear live is taking away from the TV show
TopGear wet and wild.......sounds like a bad porno
TopGear Around 1:08 Stig brings up a very good point
TopGear Those turns were executed wonderfully!
TopGear Check out this video on YouTube:
TopGear I noticed there was a bit of water on the track surface BUT CLAMN!
TopGear Is the stig wearing an antifog shield in his helmet?
TopGear Awesome car control, stig is great!
TopGear terrible conditions for the tyres
TopGear I drove one close to 40 years ago when they were the Lotus Seven. Even the with the 1600 cc Ford engine you could do 45 degree power slides on dry pavement. That was long before drifting was even though of. The only problem was the windshield, it was like trying to push a barn door through the air, so your top speed was about 80 mph or 130 kph. But on a twisty road they are a huge amount of fun.
TopGear Super!! fajnie ze mamy polskiego Top Geara!
TopGear thanks for broadcasting it in german  if you do it, when only with original (english) audio and german subtitles, not this gossiplevel wich they translate to...And lool at TG in Spain (brain overload coming :D )And btw: TG Australia has been RUINED with Season3, Season 2 was waaay better, season 1 was meh (mostly because of the primary host...)
TopGear The only thing that you can get a chance to win a free email service and the Price of the King of the Crown Estate is the most popular and the Price of the Crown Estate. The comments for your help. I have been a while to get your free time to time but I think the best way to get the best way to get the best way for the use of a new York City of London and the Price of course the UK and Ireland and Wales with company number of people who are looking for a couple of weeks ago by the way, and the Price of the Crown Estate
TopGear Im French,but i used to watch the French version,but not anymore,i simply cant get back to it,the English version is the best,end of story
TopGear Greetings from Mxico. Spanish dubbing is rubbish.
TopGear I am German but I never watch this in my own language, I like the original English version.By the way, Hammond in Spanish is best.
TopGear English top gear and english accent language beats all!
TopGear Im mexican, obviously my mother tongue is Spanish, however I cant stand anything the Spanish voice acting or abything else than the original. It simply is unnatural.
TopGear Scandinavia, probably the only place where we do not dub shows or movies... in the woooorld.
TopGear I couldnt stand watching top gear in non english
TopGear when you will come to saudi arabia
TopGear Turkish voice actors are terrible! In every movie they are always the same and they pronounce very strange.... German and original are the best! Spanish and more spanish sound very funny and I wonder why they need 1000 words to say somethink very eazy xD
TopGear Voiceover is the indicator that a country is stupid and can not read subtitles!
TopGear Thank God it is subtitled here in Greece, as are most foreign language shows.
TopGear pour other countries! its like yeah top gear is on, but why cant we hear their voices?oh yeah my country is too dumb to understand english. wedontdub
TopGear Worlds most watched factual show... ahem... factual... Top Gear is my favourite TV show of all time and its definitely the most entertaining, but I wouldnt call it factual LMAO.
TopGear I actually prefer the original sound with sub!!
TopGear And from here in south Kurdistan translate to kurdish
TopGear And you started with the Hungarian! Thats so cool :D
TopGear Top Gear fans in Indonesia is very much, but why Top Gear dont have languange Indonesia?
TopGear I dont know, but the Hungarian version has a very similar voice for Jeremy. I havent seen this version.
TopGear happy to be norwegian... nothing is dubbed
TopGear hammond in spanish HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!
TopGear I rather watch stuff in their original language and read the subs than dubbed. Dubbed ruins everything.
TopGear isnt BAC British Aircraft Corporation?
TopGear Anyone know what Season and Series this is from?
TopGear When can I try it in France?!!
TopGear 6:12 well Im watching this on an iPad...

TopGear Come ride this in Mauritius 95 Sun all year long!
TopGear Jeremy you old bastard you. Still kicking in the fast track as always haha. Well done.

TopGear TopGear has been dubbed in pretty much every language around the world.
TopGear I shat myself laughing at Shanes face when Richard started talking Spanish!
TopGear Hammond in Spanish PRICELESS xD
TopGear I think German and the normal UK Voice are the best ones
TopGear Im French,but i used to watch the French version,but not anymore,i simply cant get back to it,the English version is the best,end of story
TopGear Greetings from Mxico. Spanish dubbing is rubbish.
TopGear I love the original, and prefer to watch it in the original version, but I have to say that the German voices actually fit pretty well.
TopGear Im mexican, obviously my mother tongue is Spanish, however I cant stand anything the Spanish voice acting or abything else than the original. It simply is unnatural.
TopGear Hammond kind of sounds right in spanish. Jeremy sounds right in German and May in propah pucca English. Dont know if everyone will get what I mean
TopGear Sound like Spain peoples no Mexicans
TopGear I think Ill just watch it in English LOL!
TopGear TopGear has been dubbed in pretty much every language around the world.
TopGear american voice sucks ,  it s like to hear a duck speaking ... the english voice is more soft but not better than a latin voice really soft . i prefer to watch top gear in french than the american voice of top gear .  the english brit top gear voice is better but not so good than you say it .
TopGear I am German but I never watch this in my own language, I like the original English version.By the way, Hammond in Spanish is best.
TopGear nothing better than english and omg spanish hahahhaa
TopGear I love the Spanish and Italian, just for sheer comedy. I also remember seeing Top Gear in German whilst on a school trip in Germany (and I only, vaguely speak French). That was interesting.
TopGear The german translation of Top Gear is crap and thats so I watch the original version
TopGear Spanish Hammond.Just... yes.
TopGear English top gear and english accent language beats all!
TopGear Hammond kind of sounds right in spanish. Jeremy sounds right in German and May in propah pucca English. Dont know if everyone will get what I mean
TopGear Only heard it once in Turkish and i can say it feels very strange to hear them in another voice. Original is the best.
TopGear Turkish voice actors are terrible! In every movie they are always the same and they pronounce very strange.... German and original are the best! Spanish and more spanish sound very funny and I wonder why they need 1000 words to say somethink very eazy xD
TopGear i like the englich and the german languages
TopGear I actually prefer the original sound with sub!!
TopGear Spanish from Spanien sucks and the other lenguages too. I prefer just in english with subtitles.
TopGear And you started with the Hungarian! Thats so cool :D
TopGear Most Widely Watched Factual Television Programme in the World my gluteus maximus, does anyone remember their take on the Tesla roadster. Love the show but its only factual when it suits them.The High Court in London rejected Teslas libel claim, claiming the series is an entertainment programme and not an information programme.
TopGear I meant Dubai is a city in UAE
TopGear German! But the BEST ones are the originals, the latest on the Top Gear Chanel on Streetfire!
TopGear What is everyone talking about. An American voice and an English voice ? Its the same language!
TopGear no thanks keep the real voice
TopGear I rather watch stuff in their original language and read the subs than dubbed. Dubbed ruins everything.
TopGear it looks like it belongs in a mass effect game, its awesome
TopGear is this car faster then the Atom 500?
TopGear MonoMonkey in Spanish. Bac Monkey?
TopGear This is why top gear is my favorite show ever awesome vid :)
TopGear Im watching this on an iPad
TopGear Top Gears production team reminds us why theyre the best. Great video. I wasnt expecting the car to be that expensive, though.
TopGear Still my favorite go to the Atom
TopGear Why dont the people who engineer these cars think Hey, why dont we put a cockpit type windshield on the car? Kind of like a fighter jet?Surely they can make one that doesnt weigh that much...
TopGear Why wont you jus put on the kind of helmet that the stig has?
TopGear Its called the BAC Monkey 3
TopGear 1:38 I laughed so hard !!
TopGear Fendered at the front, Open Wheel at the back, strange.
TopGear Probably one of the best conclusion Ive ever seen.
TopGear Jeremy you old bastard you. Still kicking in the fast track as always haha. Well done.
TopGear Lol I love Jeremys face haha
TopGear The Brits have to learn how to punt their unions so they can make stuff that actually works.
TopGear Check out this video on YouTube:

TopGear I.want.one., its so.beautiful! And the gtr my dream car!
TopGear Some say that Stig is headless and Jemery wears his helmet.
TopGear you didnt drive her during perfect road trip
TopGear you forgot russian translation :(
TopGear My god... I found my dream track car! So beautiful.
TopGear Question: for a fun racing car with a decent engine and open world experience, why should i pay 100k for the Mono when i can buy an Ariel for less than half?Im kinda missing the comparison between both here.
TopGear My goodness, Jeremy, please wash your teeth, theyre pretty much yellow!!!
TopGear They should testdrive the new Radical RCX Turbo coming out soon :D That would be awesome :D
TopGear You people..! You people have the best job!
TopGear Everyone Above and Below meloves topgear

TopGear its rainy but our spirits are not dampened hah
TopGear When I have to go to the UK, it takes me a week to get used to driving on the right side. And I seems to piss off everyone when I have to use any roundabouts.
TopGear Looks like thor has strucken him down with his......rain or summet like that.
TopGear In the description, they spelt his name Ton HiddlestonE. With an E. Theres no E
TopGear he is so gorgeous. crying
TopGear He would have a tank anxld beibg mad with the tank.
TopGear why didnt he fly trough the track.
TopGear Englands great if youre a duck.Its either raining, just finished raining or just about to start raining.
TopGear Wow, Mr. May truly took a batter...tips hat
TopGear The car is blue again 5:31 what ???
TopGear love the 55 miles long 90mile beach
TopGear i wish someday toyota will make a super car. like the nissan GTR. just something equivalent to it. toyota is slowly getting out of the market race to me. the 2014 models are just shit!!
TopGear I have replied to way too many comments on this post, ah well, some of you need to correctedinformed on some things
TopGear It was blue JamesA trater hit it
TopGear Laugh out loud got caught
TopGear I was so excited when I heard they filmed an episode here in New Zealand then I watched it and was let down. We have so many amazing roads to drive and this it what they did ......a corolla... lame...
TopGear 90 mile beach is called 90 mile beach because its exactly 55 miles Im from New Zealand and I dont even know why its called 90 mile beach when its not even 90 miles long! xD
TopGear Yacht, is a type of boat, with a sail... Duh
TopGear James Mays reaction at the end is truly priceless. Hahaha!
TopGear 90 mile beach that is exactly 55 miles LOL
TopGear James May is working! xD
TopGear 7:07 microphone in top left corner of the screen. Lol and did yall notice at when he got back from the beach to gravel he said Back to gravel again was not expecting that the car was supposed to be red, was blue!? Look at the frame.... :D
TopGear That is not the fastest car in the world
TopGear I thought James liked sailing? Hahahaha.
TopGear Classic T G they dont make them like that anymore :(
TopGear do you see the expression on james face when he sets eyes on the the car at first? priceless
TopGear Jeremy  o sarcasmo puro!
TopGear that is the fastest car in the world it can beat buggati veyron supersport?
TopGear If The stig is norwegian Im gonna guess its Tommy Rustad. He was the driver on the norwegian version of fifth gear a few years back and hes pretty damn good.
TopGear i bet the new Stig is Mikka Hkinnen
TopGear I love the Kia Ceed. We cant get it here in the US any more. So, alas, I drive a Hyundai. Not bad, but not as cool as a Ceed.
TopGear Hugh is joking, stig is Gordon Shedden  but I like to think hes not human as a bit of fun
TopGear Surely the Norwegian accent bit was a red herring, just like all of the Some Say intros.
TopGear Love a man in lippy haha
TopGear Guys...the Norwegian accent is misleading. If it were true, they would have edited it out..
TopGear Hugh is like an older version of Dan Hardcastle
TopGear You, guys, do realize that hes an ACTOR and he could have said the Stig has an Indian or Chinese accent with the same straight face (and then act like he wasnt supposed to say it).
TopGear I like how the Stig had an umbrella when he wears an helmet.
TopGear Super Light Cars and Ryan Ellis on Gearzput the Stig in this.
TopGear Wheres the road? Oh that will do. I was rolling when he said that.
TopGear Why doesnt the Stig have a white umbrella? And I thought Stig was waterproof...
TopGear why do so many people believe that what this man says about stigs accent. are you so daft? Obviously they wouldve editted out that part if it were a truth. They just told him to say that for entertainment.
TopGear sono dei geni sei un grande grazieeeee
TopGear Da dove le prendi le puntate?? :D
TopGear Why are they using bad replicas?
TopGear Is the Stig in there? Wouldnt be surprised, THE STIG IS IMMORTAL.
TopGear This is pretty cool...all the mods that would have to be necessary to make this possible must be incredible.
TopGear Awesome performance. This must be Clarksons idea. How does the 911 not explode?
TopGear Who is the chick!!! She can light me up any day!!!
TopGear REST IN PEACE PAUL WALKER 3
TopGear This reminds Paul Walker Death.They shouldnt made this video.
TopGear My eyes are burning, I wish I could just save the rims.
TopGear let me guest, jeremys idea, i bet he some where in the back rubbing his hands and an evil laugh, burn porsche burn..................
TopGear Porsches in flames? Too soon junior!
TopGear a burning porche ..... reminds me of paul walker .hope he enjoys his new life in heaven .
TopGear I think people need to get over their feelings over inanimate objects. : Dont get me wrong I love cars too, but I wouldnt get too caught up in emotions over a flaming car.
TopGear Richard must have been crying.... And i bet this was Jeremys idea
TopGear I feel as though Jeremy had something to do with this...
TopGear A burning porsche will always remind me of Paul Walkers death smh to soon for burning porsche videos anyone else agree
TopGear REST IN PEACE PAUL WALKER 3
TopGear You can tell when the rating start to slip. Its when they waist money destroying beautiful thing in the name of entertainment.
TopGear Can I have that 911 now ?!!!!
TopGear Paul walker last stunt!??
TopGear CoolBeautiful.Nice Art.Thanks.
TopGear Commercial for Porche! Their sales fell due to Paul Walker accident
TopGear CALL 911!! THERES A FIRE
TopGear ghost riders, porsche
TopGear It looks very pretty in slow motion.However, you can also see very clearly how the car has been setup with jets near the rear exhaust pipes spraying burning material onto the floor. You can also see that ALL the fire on the car is generated by gas jets setup inside various openings in the car.Sure its done as a pretty stunt, but whats the point?
TopGear Paul Walker or too soon?
TopGear you called david tennant gay!!!!! i fucking hate you!!!!!!
TopGear The word red was written in orange.
TopGear Lazy fatties bashing on cyclists... In the Netherlands were all cyclists, thats probably why were one of the healthiest people in the world.
TopGear Its funny because it is true.
TopGear First the awesome run out of alabama episode and now this. If I was suppose to start watching top gear without really being into cars would I enjoy it? And if so which season should I start on?
TopGear More bad drivers than bad cyclists.
TopGear You guys, its urgent that you accept salvation from hell fire!All humans have sinned, and all our sins added together equal eternity in hell, on the other hand you can believe in Jesus Christ alone and he will save you.Jesus is the son of God Totally God and totally Man) who never ever sinned, was brutally killed on the cross for our sins, (each bad thing we do was left in a tomb, and recovered from death back to life.At the exact moment you believe in him alone, Jesus will add eternal life and forgiveness of sins to your life.
TopGear One of the best safety ads ever, as for the Westminster councillors they should be sacked for not taking heed.This ad gets the point across, until there is legislation and compulsory registration with a number plate certain cyclists will carry on being reckless as they cannot be caught.
TopGear Any auto advert about the difference between 50cm and 1,5m?...
TopGear The funniest thing I have seen in years!! I do wish this clip included a bit of the panels reaction to this in order to put in context.
TopGear Being both a cyclist and a car driver, I cannot agree more with this public safety announcement by Top Gear (copyright BBC).Top Gear Bicycle Advert
TopGear but not pedestrians? Thats not really fair. I think its OK for a cyclist to go thru a red if there is no one coming. Anyone who is getting to where they are going using their own energy and not being lazy in a car should be allowed to get there as fast as they can, safely of course. Hell a lot more drivers go thru yellows and reds than cyclists.
TopGear The best part about cycling is no traffic laws.
TopGear I say lets go bowling for bicycles
TopGear Brilliant, Short, Simple, Effective.
TopGear Was hoping to see the planning of it. Christ on a bike! I thought it was just a metaphor but then Jesus comes riding a bike past them, rofld.
TopGear As a cyclist myself this is fucking hilarious...
TopGear I wish all cyclists got blown up to be honest.
TopGear An important lesson for cyclists: Top Gear Bicycle Advert
TopGear must see full episode!
TopGear Richard, Jeremy and James on Phineas and Ferb, AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! :D
TopGear TIL TopGear is making a cameo in Phineas and Ferb
TopGear Where is Peniston and Larsens Biscuits as sponsors?
TopGear Uhh.. Thats utterly ridiculous
TopGear Doofen....Disch.....Koenigseggsegegseeessgsgggsggs?
TopGear Top Gear hat einen Youtubekanal, bei dem Sie sich gut und gerne 420h aufhalten knnen. Alles auf englisch und um Lngen schner als auf deutsch
TopGear hem, ich schau das immer im Original. Falls es Fragen gibt wie das geht, einfach melden.
TopGear aber nur nen TATAdiesel...))
TopGear MchtegernRennwagen? Naja, wenn man bedenkt, dass Peugeot zur Zeit nach AMG die zweithchste Literleistung bei Serienwagen auf die Beine stellt, wrde ich diese Aussage an Ihrer Stelle noch mal berdenken ) UNd der 208 GTi ist mMn ein wrdiger Nachfolger fr den legendren 205 GTi.Und dass der AmiAbklatsch kacke ist, sollte klar sein. Machen nur scheisse und knnen nur geradeaus fahren, objektiv zu bewerten ist denen Typen nicht mglich... Die sollen erstmal ihre eingenen Schrottkisten verbessern, bevor man ber die europischen Autos meckert
TopGear Es gibt auch Top Gear Australia
TopGear Ruined it with the jesus bit.
TopGear 4 people who think theyre always right
TopGear I need a .... motherfuckers. at the end :D
TopGear Take a look at this video on YouTube:
TopGear Jako rowerzysta codziennie obserwujcy innych rowerzystw na ulicach, podpisuj si wszystkimi czonkami.
TopGear Tell us how you really feel Arch!(This vid is one of your best!)
TopGear From what Ive seen on the show Omega is a big sponsor,Ive the guys wear Bond SMP 300s,Railmaster XXL, Planet Ocean and Speedmaster in professional and Dark Side flavor, also Submariner.
TopGear Disappointed this was not a guide to which watches the top gear presenters wear them selves. Im always trying to catch a glimpse of what theyre wearing, sometimes some interesting pieces, especially Hammond.
TopGear I cant believe that theres no mention of an Oris in that magazine.....
TopGear absolutely fantastic, and a really truthfull and funny review!!
TopGear What a book of fucking LIES!. fucking disgusting book you have there archie!
TopGear Are you aware that people can only afford watches in the magazine? It doesnt claim to be a watch guru magazine. Snobbery. Cheap doesnt mean shit. And by the way, 200 pounds isnt cheap for some people to spend on a watch.
TopGear The guides dogshit then?
TopGear No matter the topic Archie always brings the passion. I love these posts. Keep up the great work Archie. PS. I would love to hear you critique anything with a few drinks in you. Youre the best!
TopGear This just has to be Archies best video!
GameSack Werd mal sehn was ich tun kann. Bis jetz werd ich an jedem Wochenende ein Game hochladen.

TopGear the tundra is the best pick up truck it did actually pull the endeavor
TopGear is that the same stig as in the uk top gear? or is he an american stig?
TopGear dude whats with changing the voices it makes it like shit man , just stop acting smarts and upload proper videos .dickhead
TopGear whats with the audio??
TopGear I like all your videos man i wonder if you still make any more
TopGear Wtf do u make the video quality sooooo bad
TopGear helium for everyone huh?
TopGear yes all us English lie!! I love the usa and everything it stands for ) why if your car goes up to 190 would that be the end of your speedo
TopGear Every top gear us they have the voices changed in not great
TopGear Nice. I have seen this video but now i cant find the original one anymore. Thanks.
TopGear Babies are no good at building roads. Ha!
TopGear I enjoyed watching this special but it definetely wasnt the best special ever as Hammond says.
TopGear At this point, Richards stallion decided to get amorous with Jamess mare.
TopGear The stallion tried to mount Jamess horse?Was expecting Clarkson to make a joke about the Stallion seeing one horses ass on top of another.
TopGear Im no expert but those look like some small horses
TopGear I couldnt stop laughing XD Hahahahahahhaha
TopGear jessuss.. i mean.. budhaa.. LOL haha
TopGear You guys r so horrible, you arent supposed to get to close to the horse infront of you...... not to mention, ur so heavy for those horses or maybe more like ponies.
TopGear goddd ,me laughin like an idiot,,and my dad,,,,,is like what the fuck are you doing!!!!,,,,,and offcourse me laughin moree and moree
TopGear James: Jesus... I mean Budda!
TopGear such fucking idiots, they arent fighting, they love each other...
TopGear May I use your restroom, my scrotum is on fire The woman probably thought he was asking to go in there and rub one out lmao
TopGear Make more cycle lanes...keep cyclists in them, keep everyone else out of them...problem solved.
TopGear 4:50 Richard clarkson is hella funny
TopGear Holland is the best, drove there once, I nearly ran over 10 cyclists.
TopGear why did you get city bikes those things are worthless they dont have suspension and only 3 gears
TopGear As a cyclist Ive had 3 traffic accidents, since I got a car I didnt crash at all!Except for that one time I thought I could drift round a corner hmm
TopGear Toothpaste on my privates so she can brush her teeth. ..I wish.
TopGear Take a look at this video on YouTube:
TopGear Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
TopGear Random question: Ive noticed that in some top gear clips the clothing on the guys (in this video the bike helmets) still have their tags on. Anyone know if there is a reason for this?
TopGear As a cyclist I would just like to say that this was bloody hilarious. The amount of people that jump red lights and generally dont have a clue what theyre doing is ridiculous. Cycling in the city isnt hard, just show where youre going and people are lenient. Apart from the odd bus and taxi driver, most people are fine
TopGear Work harder get a car lmao
TopGear ....toothpaste on your scrotum?.....?....I am laughing so hard, I cannot breathe
TopGear Really good clarkson Hammond sucks at driving
TopGear Ok, I always drive to opposite lane so I can leave a big gap between my car n the cyclists which can put myself to danger when some cyclists are very considerate to drive in the middle of the lane or during holiday time, they like to cycle side by side with friend s, so why asking us to be considerate when the problem is actually on them?
TopGear How to keep cycling safe in England? Keep Clarkson and May off of bikes XD
TopGear Why do people think lanes for cars are lanes for bicycles? Its YOU that chose to live in a city, were you surprised when you saw cars driving in car lanes?.. Stay off the road and leave the cycling to country getaways.
TopGear James: Look at him, hes wearing normal clothing the lunatic!Jeremy: YOULL BE KILLED!!!!!
TopGear LOL I saw this episode yesterday.
TopGear I love the last part where they build the bridge on River Kok
TopGear Seen the whole series......better than season 20
TopGear what name song from 2:18 ?
TopGear What a damn tease! When are you assholes ganna start uploading whole episodes like everyone knows you should?! FUCK!
TopGear Best show on American tv !
TopGear Learn how to pronounce the name of the river. The way you are pronouncing it has a meaning that will make the Thais smile even harder when you say it:)
TopGear Do they buy trucks that are nearly broken on purpose so they can complain about them?
TopGear )         ,         Marussia b2      ,  Lamborghini Aventador  McLarenLooked totally loved this series) I do not know you read this post or not, but I would like that you tested Marussia b2 along with other sports cars such as Lamborghini Aventador or McLaren
TopGear (Please come to thailand!)
TopGear I bet 90 of the things that go wrong on Top Gear are staged.
TopGear Hammond basically had a Kettenkrad.
TopGear Top Gear Festival 2014!!! When I met Clarkson and got burnt...and other things
TopGear In Finland the oldest taxis are from 2011. Mostly E:Class Mercs.
TopGear This show is so scripted and staged it may as well be a sitcom and a lame sitcom at that.
TopGear i never thought id say these words, but i actually think the crown vic would win this.
TopGear NO! Not the top gear production office!
TopGear In Austria, we have AMG, and SClass Taxis. :D
TopGear Why Captain Slow wasnt driving the English taxi? It would be more appropriate.
TopGear when he crashed to the limo that was fake
TopGear no bigbody toyota cab? its Manilas finest!
TopGear dammit I thought Mexico won for a sec lol
TopGear The vochos us the better
TopGear you guys forgot the best taxi in the world along with the best drivers, for forgot the great South African taxi, goes any where on road off road at any speed and no road signs or traffic rules apply to them. simple the best !!!???
TopGear donald, somebody might know the answer youre looking for , but you turned the reply function off you dip stick.
TopGear That lap could have been improved
TopGear You can actually see some skin in his neck :O
TopGear Its not a real Stig. Real Stig would have listened to Chineese language lesson or something...
TopGear When I watched this video about the BMW M135i, BBC America had 1,350 video, this video had 135 likes, and the length of this video was 1:35.
TopGear OMG I WANT TO DO THIS!
TopGear I was there on 1st day of the Top Gear Festival in Sydney when Jules doing a car bungee and Im a HUGE fan of Top Gear
TopGear lol he pronounces koenigsegg as koniseg
TopGear Only 1 Hour and 6 Minutes left until Top Gear Series 21 Episode 6: The Burma Special Part 12 airs at 8:00pm on BBC Two in the United Kingdom!
TopGear haha, thats epic. pretty burnouts, who would have thought?!
TopGear They never let James finish a sentence, do they? Hmmm.
TopGear Jeremy put your foot down in the Agera R already !! it doesnt get any faster than that. MAKE IT HAPPEN !
TopGear they didnt make a review of the ferrari laferrari yet? what the heck?!
TopGear episodes 6 and 7 are in Burma hence not a studio show
TopGear This one made me laugh the most lmao
TopGear Its full hd images from Top Gear series21 episode05. The one with the Porsche 918. I have the full video also but naturally posting the full hour long episode would break copyright laws. :)
TopGear A american gas guzzler will do this job easily, own one myself and am proud of it.
TopGear Dear BBC. What Series is this? So that I can buy this when it comes out :D
TopGear major error on their part, thinking its still dangerous there... In fact the background radiation in the exclusion zone is no more than in the rest of the country, except for a few small hot spots.And those are easily avoided, especially if you stay on the roads.
TopGear Ok, is it just me or didnt Richard, James,  Jeremy go through Syria just before there civil war? Now Ukraine and Russia takes Crimea? I think Putin may be a producer on TopGearconspiracytheory
TopGear Crap cars!And when u have to save fuel, according to them, u must hit the gas and highest revs to be there as quick as possible instead of driving between 20004000 rpm?
TopGear They should have opened the windows
TopGear lol ignorant prius owners should hate this episode. :P
TopGear Anybody know the music at 06:24?
TopGear I have seen the full clip, butHow do you achieve those airshots above the buildings ?who was holding the camera ?and why did the camera man did not stop recording or at least yell out when Jeremy ran out of fuel ?a nice clip but some details there are a bit strange.
TopGear Aww dacia sandero, luv you May
TopGear Wheres the rest of it!!!!
TopGear Why didnt they just get the car stuck or crash it so it wont move
TopGear Why dont they just drive laps around the high way, just keep getting on and off
TopGear hands down fukushima is worse.
TopGear Roll down all the windows and blast ac that would have made em run out sooner. Bad for sound quality but who cares.
TopGear what a pathetic program...dont they understand we need to save fuel ?? what a shit program !!these brits and americans teach us all sorts of advices we dont even ask for....and now what r de doing?? fucking hypocrites
TopGear That radiation detector was WAY to sensitive....
TopGear disabling the engine management system is the smartest thing he could do.my corsa b guzzles 35 l per 100 km instead of 7. nearly run out of fuel due to air mass sensor problem.
TopGear Surprised they didnt give Hammster a 5pt harness. The man is truly fearless (remembering the Nardo run in the Noble as well)!
TopGear i just booked 2 of these
TopGear Mercedes should never ever change the classic design of that model.Never.
TopGear TC9700Gaming You need this mod on SpinTires.
TopGear omg that thing is a beast! Fricking awesome!
TopGear As soon as the cameras are off he went out and bought one.
TopGear Incredible Modern Gorgeous Truck, would like to have one ( If I were a Millionaire ) to go for a spin with my Girlfriend.
TopGear GWagons are just perfect for terrain
TopGear I have to get one.... love it !!!
TopGear The Rub Al Khali (Empty Quarter) is a part of southern Saudi Arabia  not Abu Dhabi.
TopGear Wow that is an animal.. Luxury feeling inside, war machine look on the outside, unstoppable.. Geesh now i know what Im getting if I hit the lotto!!!!
TopGear only now i know what is my dream .. this and f12 . i dont want more !
TopGear What Nathan Drake shouldve used to cross the Rubal Khali in Uncharted 3
TopGear Come here in saudia arabia and go to mustora and drive there
TopGear Looks and sounds brilliant!
TopGear I dont understand the attraction to those hideous drag cars, and I am American.
TopGear I would like to see Top Gear do some real drag racing in a pro stock, pro mod or top fuel car. Or even better team up with John Force for some lessons, that would be entertaining to watch!
TopGear that mustache what the f.. youve decided to get older, Richard?
TopGear HAHA! That W116 monster truck... :D
TopGear With four wheel steering maneuverability would be comparable... I just want to see a Lamborghini body on a monster truck. How hard could it be?
TopGear Richard looks ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooolllldd... XD
TopGear Weird how Dodge made a concept 6x6 and when the German company bought them said it wouldnt be viable, pointless and no one would want it....now they make this...bs all the way! Good looking though
TopGear Nice style bro amazing
TopGear Thank you for a complete onboard lap !!
TopGear 1:00 That understeer though
TopGear I love the autoblip when he or she down shifts .
TopGear This is the best outofthebox drift car EVER. So long the track is wet. But its England, so most likely XD
TopGear I wonder who the Stig is this year, since poor Michael may never recover from the skiing accident.
TopGear Work Harder. Get a Car.
TopGear does anyone know the song in the background of this advert??? wud really like to kno
TopGear JACK WHITEHALL Behind the Scenes On TOP GEAR  Leaning to Drive!
TopGear Watching this now on BBC America.
TopGear Ministerstvo zdravotnictv varuje, Top Gear zpsobuje zchvaty smchu vedouc k uduen divka.Top Gear: Burma Special Trailer  BBC Two topgear  burma
TopGear The song is called Fortunate Son  Creedence Clearwater Revival
TopGear I prefer these ones when they get cheap basic vehicles and go around the UKWorld doing challenges, I find new superhyper cars a bit boring and the guest in the reasonably priced car! lol.
TopGear Sorry I dont get it sending 3 guys  a film crew to Burma  film a staged set up This is being payed with tv licence fees  the same for the American trip completely staged
TopGear oh god this is going to be funny
TopGear They should do one across Australia next.
TopGear The Africa special had to be the best episode by far. I hope these 3 live forever so Top Gear will never end.
TopGear FINALLY! This special is so late.
TopGear Will this just be on DVD or TV ?
TopGear Nice, cant wait to see this upcoming episode
TopGear omg ! did james may hair cut ??
TopGear Looking forward to this
TopGear Looks killer, but performs poorly.
TopGear What Top Gear didnt say: unofficially the fastest car on their straight (300 kmh), 060 in 2.6 sec in a car with manual gear and rear wheel drive. The car cant put down more than 400 hp in those conditions. And as for the fire: even highly engineered Porsches catches on fire these days... Just felt like defending my countries only car :)
TopGear it looks bumpy as all heck!
TopGear Its a shame a BMW M5 is faster than this in the wet.
TopGear Show more like that!!!
TopGear That thing is a handful. Id like to see a dry lap.
TopGear Many unrefinement. So no quality. Much denmark. Very fire. Wow
TopGear They should wait for dry day anyway.
TopGear Looks hard to drive.but i guess is fun
TopGear cant believe it caught on fire...

TopGear That steering wheel is ugly as hell.
TopGear Vaya coche... es inconducible
TopGear As soon as I heard the music I jumped straight to my computer to see if it was real or if I was just imagining it :)
TopGear ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL.WE ARE HARBINGER.WE ARE ASSUMING CONTROL.
TopGear Lol, I just caught this Episode on BBC Canada, they changed the music. Guess EA Decided to be a dick about the copyright on that music
TopGear MASS EFFECT3333!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear Annoying review. He describes the car as Striking, intelligent, and unusual. Well Ill give him the last one. Though strikingly offensively hideous, pompous, and unusual looking are probably more fitting of this particular... Thing. It more closely resembles a lugi, or some sea creature youd expect to see only at great depths where the dark of the ocean would conceal is misshapen nose.Really dont like his offensive references to Jesus either. Great show, bad review.
TopGear hehe awesome use of music! also. Nice profile pic. actually hit my screen trying to get what i thought was a spider off it :P
TopGear Goosebumps all over when I heard it... Lot of wrong with ME3 but the music is just epic and fits so well to this piece... well done topgear . Love the car too!
TopGear THIS IS COMMANDER SHEPARD AND THIS IS MY FAVOURITE SHOW IN THE GALAXY :D
TopGear Uptake perfect music for the presentation of the car ... Great Job Top gear
TopGear I KNEW i wasnt going insane when i heard this! I had to listen to it again, all i could think was:Is it? Could it be? ... No.. No it cant.. No way.. Yes! Yes i can! FKIN MASS EFFECT! FUCK YEA!Thing is, The Producers didnt even credit Clint or BioWare for this!
TopGear Where is the full video??
TopGear I would kill someone just so they could haul me over to jail in one of these :)
TopGear EA needs to make a Hot Persuit: Dubai. They dont have to make up any fancy police cars either. Its all laid out for them.
TopGear Love his reaction when the FF and SLS are driving up
TopGear 00:02 the siren answers him
TopGear The cars are for you people to go and visit dubai.. They are not for actual police work.. Its a marketing decision, not a security decision.Its the guys who market dubai as a tourist hub that came up with it not the chief of police...
TopGear NFS POLICE COOL!!!! (IS IT REAL??? OR JUST FOR FUN?)
TopGear i will be glad if the Dubai police gave me a ticket :D
TopGear The only reason to be a police man over there
TopGear That Quadski is one of the coolest toys theyve ever used for a race :D
TopGear Still, could be worse..
TopGear Why dont they upload the clips to Top Gears own channel?
TopGear Fuck theyve dumbed this show down over the years. It used to feel spontaneous and fun, and unscripted even though it probably was. Now they treat their audience like theyre total fucking morons!
TopGear I rather have the jet ski
TopGear Clarkson was never so clean and washed, that He was that day:) great race as always on TG!
TopGear Around 3:15 theres a Ferrari passing Hammond
TopGear By now.. lotus elise sucks..
TopGear And another good new...Alfa is preparing a hotter version with 2.0 liters engine and about 320 hp.
TopGear If they tried this in the states, Clarkson would have to be wearing a helmet and a life preserver. Plus the atvjet ski would be slower with all the required smog controls.
TopGear Who else notices the Ferrari 360 on 3:15???
TopGear Hammond complains about the Alfas width,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,short arse specific!
TopGear Mitico Jeremy!!! ahahahah, fantastico......
TopGear Guarda questo video su YouTube:

TopGear Knowledge is everything
TopGear That Fendt 936 Vario is worth more on the market then other three vehicles combined.
TopGear TOP GEAR go to croatia
TopGear Supercars are not sports cars like in this video, Supercar are worth millions, like bugatti,koenigsegg,mclaren etc...these are just middleclass sportscars
TopGear Man that fendt is worth more then a honda ciciv wow
TopGear i like the music can anybody tell me whitch band is playing the music?
TopGear Nice bit of posing boys, lets show those poor ex communists what our life is all about?
TopGear kot da bi kloarjem kampe daju hahaha
TopGear Sooooo....for all us American Yanks, what IS a Lippie?
TopGear The 24 hours at Silverstone was great because all that exhaustion allows us as viewers to get past the TV personas, especially of Hamster and Jezza, and really SEE who they are. I still remember the end of that race, where Jeremy is beside himself with emotion (YOU BRILLIANT LITTLE CAR!) and theres a quick shot of Richard sporting a smile which would shame the Cheshire Cat. That smile positively screamed relief, exhaustion and yet accomplishment, all in one moment.I really felt like I SAW them in that moment ... and one way or another, Id like to see them again, something like that.
TopGear Really, thats quick!! Faster then a lott of supercars. Looks like alfa has created a giant killer.
TopGear Sadly this was not shown in episode 2......
TopGear viva alfa romeo caralho!!! alfa romeo  budget ferrari!! but petrol onesalfa romeo diesel  50 fiat 50 alfa

TopGear please put full segment on you tube I missed first bit, Tanks
TopGear nice work great show for a Sunday evening
TopGear I thought it was just americans, but do british too honestly belive their army is protecting them by being in the middle east?
TopGear This video contains content from BBC Worldwide. It is restricted from playback on certain sites. Apparently Top Gears Tumblr page (linked from their twitter feed) is one of those sites.
TopGear FYI BRITISH PEOPLE GET TO WATCH TOP GEAR ON SUNDAYS NOT MONDAYS LIKE YOU YANKS
TopGear 7 and a half tons? And I thought it would be heavier than the marauder
TopGear Why does Hammond look really sinister and evil with that beard?
TopGear looks like an excellent device for us who live close to lakes :)
TopGear RICHARD WHAT IS THAT ON YOUR FACE?
TopGear that looks hella fun where can i buy one
TopGear Where can i get this thing ?
TopGear richard looks like ironman hero.
TopGear Even youtube took the dislike button away
TopGear You guys cant do anything wrong. Another great Show!
TopGear Cant wait. Top Gear is quickly becoming one of my favorite shows.

TopGear XD Ahh this is so hilarious!!!
TopGear So funny when Jeremy throws the cabbage at Hammonds Fiesta!!! XD
TopGear Ah christ his whispery voice during that last bit just killed me.
TopGear I busted out laughing at the umbrella scene hahaha love him!!!!
TopGear Did he gain weight his cheeks look kinda chunky, of is it the helmet, either way hes still cute
TopGear Loki in a reasonable price car!
TopGear Those three are bril. Hugh especially I didnt know he could be funny.
TopGear Bill Murray is fucking riot! lol
TopGear bill murray is comedy gold
TopGear Ah, this was so much fun!
TopGear this episode was great
TopGear I just love Bill Murrays uncontrollable laughing  that alone would have set me off even if I didnt know what the joke was.
TopGear Cant remember when I laughed so much. Matt Damon and Bill Murray were just superb as was Hugh B. Its such a lovely show  yes, Graham can be bitchy, but you just know hes a great chap and really brings out the best in his guests. I loved it at the end of the actual show when Matt Damon said that he had never had more fun on a talk show  and he meant it. Bravo Graham!
ZONEofTECH Im sorry to say, youre not fully partnered, you areonly branded, which means you have some of the same options as a full partner, but you can not get banners on your view page, or on your youtube channel, you can not create a show and you can not make any money of it. Have you even signed anything with anyone? And btw, its not illegal to say what youre earning, nobody just talks about it, I gues.. Anyway, have a good day :)
ZONEofTECH Yeah, I figured out that I wasnt a fully partner a couple of days ago. It seems that I need more subscribers to become a full partner. And yes, I agreed with Googles terms and conditions which forbade me to say what my earnings are. :)

GameSack Well, but I thought one Warmogs gives you 1000 health so 3000health in extra plus generation. Shouldnt be like in this vid 50000 health for Heimerdinger? o.O
GameSack it does and always has done true dmg so ur armor is useless...
GameSack Hey! u know that this was back in the old days, and if i think back the pool turrent didnt do true damage on that time. but now it does so thornmails did help back then.
GameSack Yeah but its 9999 health. IT doesnt show the other 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 health in the bar. The nexus also has to be destroyed.
GameSack someone was playing pong in background :D
GameSack thank you too bro!! )
GameSack waaay back in the day Heimers grenade damaged turrets
GameSack And then there was Veigar.
GameSack lol who would dislike this?
GameSack New bronze V players cant remember :D
GameSack Is your freind a duck? all I hear is QUACK, QUACK
GameSack This comment made me literally laugh out loud
GameSack it does true damage now i think
GameSack thats prob the dumbest ive read in a long long time....
GameSack I played in 2012, but i didnt know that LoL was from 2010... damn.
GameSack it does true damage now i think
GameSack thats prob the dumbest ive read in a long long time....
GameSack Almost as fake as ur moms boob job. But hey... whose complaining?
GameSack I played in 2012, but i didnt know that LoL was from 2010... damn.
GameSack Did you see the trollface at 3:16?
GameSack the pool turrets on dominion do physical damage which is very odd
GameSack I guess Jimmy is the hater here...on his own video...
GameSack so can rengar and nasus
GameSack at 2:33 that Alistar walked through the inhibitor :D
GameSack on the 2013 on march. u cant attack or click on the pool turret. its deal 1000 true damage per hit, ignores all armour and magic resistance, tyrn ulti and all the other champions abilties and spells.
GameSack This is real but a long time ago when the obelisk deals physical damage.
GameSack I would be scared shitless if a Cho Gath was spawning killing my entire team.
GameSack Hazzard161 lol that tricked me im sooo stupid :)
GameSack imo u really shudve killd the pantheon and not let the tower die, but eh lol
GameSack moneybagz131lol by level 18 on veigar you should have 1k.... deathcap, deathfire grasp, archangels  1100ap
GameSack DragOzze i got there before LOL. well if the games go on long, get full stack mejai Soul Stealer, and yeah i got to like 900 when iuse elixer of brilliance it wentup to 1k AP XD
GameSack Opteryx ecstatic over a video game isnt a common trait for normal people im afraid
GameSack Yeah, stack Archangels(for straight mana since its unique) and grab a Zhonyasduring an hour long game, you can easily get 1400AP. Personally, Ive made it to 1420 or so in a 65 minute game.
GameSack musiqaddict veigar is VERY far from OP while EXTREMELY strong when built right he has EXTREMELLY weak armor pretty much his only protection is stunning with event horizon so you can run away lol
GameSack afk pant or just suicidle for tower
GameSack gawd Ezreal still healed back then . he got hella nerfed since then.
GameSack I once had like 680 AP o.0
GameSack If you used it, you would have lived btw at 1:30 maybe? (terribad grammar right there. RELEASE THE GRAMMAR NAZIS)
GameSack Jimmy593 veigar is still really good... amazing counter pick to ap stacking teams
GameSack did you mid in this game? were u carry?
GameSack j0hnnyguy Veigar gets 5 extra ap when killing champion with any source of damage, even with auto attack, if Q is maxed.
GameSack rimiko86 agreed. that is the ONLY pro rotation
GameSack Ive played against veig who had 1k ap !
GameSack heh this was uploaded in april. looking back i see how noob i was  hey, we all thought veigar was good at one point right?
GameSack I have to say, you suck! Standing there, clicked 3 things and then died with a horrible nooo fucking retard. Just went out clicked 3 things and died, scrub..
GameSack Jimmy593 oh... hes not..? fuck man I just bought this guy perm.... :(
GameSack CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK .
GameSack Lol kill pantheon with just R at only 430 AP? no chance... You wont be able to kill Ryze with just R until you get to like 830 AP. .
GameSack Legendary ! YEEESSS ! :D
GameSack Tank team ?  Garen, Shen, Alistar .
GameSack rimiko86 use q after meteor.. to get 5 extra ap for the kill..
GameSack knnt ihr mal wider weiter machen mit LOL ist doch voll scheie das ihr stress oder so habt :D
GameSack haha wie ich da mittendrin rein komme :D
TopGear How did you get all the money?
TopGear What kind of car was that at the beginning it was a black car what is it called?
TopGear that was funny the no highway rule would have made it more interesting tho
TopGear Have nick use the sail boat next time and have the whole route go directly through the map. No highways or ring roads. Also give Tom a slower car.
TopGear This is so fucking funny! Please make more of these top gear challenges!!!
TopGear You should do the plane vs Bugatti !!
TopGear I prefer longer videos.
TopGear hahahah and btw. you can drink the milk staight from a kow but its warm
TopGear All that money how is it possible ?
TopGear I reckon you could get another half a second of if you were a little bit more patient exiting. Lot of powersliding going on losing you time.
TopGear THIS IS A GREAT SERIES!!!! GREAT VID!! KEEP IT UP!!!
TopGear 062 mph in 2.5 seconds... Dang
TopGear Id like to see you build something silly for the fun of it. turbo v8 in a mini FF or something. lol try to kill the test driver with as bad of a car that you can make.
TopGear This game keeps getting better ! Please get it on steam ASAP
TopGear Jolly hilarious I have to say old chap!
TopGear careful of copyright aha
TopGear thats epic, i already love the topgear series i think this would be awesome!
TopGear jajajaja, great intro. The circle at the end could be a plane propeller or a cannon barrel? Every time i heard that song Clarkson speaks in my brain TONIGHT jajaja
TopGear Jajajajajajajaja, Dis gon b gud!
TopGear Oh also, 600 videos! :D
TopGear you filthy mud blood XDD I assure you. We brits definitely say that
TopGear Wow I cant believe I missed this little gem, thanks for reuploading it!
TopGear This is amazing! lmao
TopGear Why are TheGeeNee allways drunk?
TopGear Lol actually vacca is italian for cow
TopGear You filthy mudblood xD
TopGear Did I hear Jimmy? First thing that comes to my head TUNABANDITS!
TopGear Love the video! Your British accents sound like speech impediments though XD
TopGear Jeremy lives on the Isle of Man
TopGear Hammersmith is in west London!
TopGear The avantimes splitter caught on fire
TopGear U play race the stig?
TopGear Je suis fan de Top Gear, et je crois me souvenir qu ils aiment pas trop le hummer
TopGear you actually are Chris Harris
TopGear How do you make your lap time list?
TopGear Not bad, glad I beat Toby, nice editing
TopGear otherwise this channel is just epic and amazing keep up the good work guys!!! best of both worlds..... fave show, fave game !!! thanks for making it a reality!!
TopGear u guys need to do like a top gear special like in india burma africa or something like top gear does i think thad be great... also do a challenge like customizing cars and doing fun challenges with them and also do races like the one with a plane to italy and car
TopGear I love this car but would have rather had the Chaparral Fan car though.
TopGear Ok so we got this, wheres the 2J?
TopGear Meh I dont particularly like this car pack very much. However the Nissan, and the Xbox One V8 Super Car are pretty nice. I would love to see a car pack with brand new GT cars or F1 cars. Cmon turn 10 only the Lotus F1 car!! You can do better lol.
TopGear Because its automatic in real life.
TopGear love the crazy 60s racers, great addition..but wait, why is there no shift animation?
TopGear April Car pack still not many new cars most of these are from pervious games
TopGear I hate you Turn 10. You and your braindead fans.
TopGear yeah. Audi rs4 and subaru impreza
TopGear Forza is an amazing game! Like people said, im not hating, but Turn 10 should really start coming out with ALL new cars, maybe 1 or 2 from Forza 4 per pack, but not 10 completely RECYCLED cars from Forza 4. This game is just basically next gen Forza 4 cuz like some guys said, theres only 1 or 2 new cars per pack and the rest are just recycled from Forza 4. T10 really needs to get their game faces on when it comes to DLC cuz this isnt going to be very popular unless NEW DLC is realeased. Not hating, I hope some of you guys agree
TopGear Turn10 you just had to add the Commodore didnt you, now im going to have to buy it
TopGear Come on turn 10, give us some more gt cars. People are really like the gt mini endurance events. The game is crying out for cars like the gallardo gt3, mp412c gt3, bmw z4 etc. Please make it happen.
TopGear Oh look, another pack full of cars from FM4.
TopGear Absolutely dreadful. Where is the C7 Corvette? Please, get with the times.
TopGear Racing Holden, Nissan R390, original Elise, Audi RS4... yeah, Im JUST cool with buying this. Still want the Alfa 4C though...
TopGear Turn 10 why do you add the Hummer to almost every Forza? It is slow as Maple Syrup and you guys never make a proper track for the Hummer
TopGear When theres an FC rx7, ill buy some dlc
TopGear Cant wait for Forza6 and getting the back log of cars from Forza4
TopGear Again cars that only should of been there in the beginning. Iracing is better a lot less cares but more excitement and real simulation
TopGear Hover van Time to show wincup whoes boss
TopGear This game is garbage compared to Forza 4
TopGear Wow this pack is kinda gay add something nice like 79 skyline ke70 s14 Honda integra and re add rims like work equip 03
TopGear As much as I really want that Chaparral, I absolutely refuse to support this DLC system! Ill probably pick this up when it inevitably goes on sale. If this is the future of Forza, I think I need to start looking for a new racing franchise. I understand that this is a launch title, but its lost the passion that made previous Forzas so enjoyable.
TopGear Wow I really want this pack! Thanks Turn10!Said no1 ever...
TopGear Hey guys id you look closely they are the same fucking cars from FM4!! Not good T10, shame on you.
TopGear oh look more cars you have to pay for that you got free in forza 4
TopGear Forza and Turn 10 please consider adding the Australian Manufactured ford falcon (factory model), you have the Holden (HSV 427), why not Ford?

TopGear Meeh... All my cars are better than that but that van, oh that van would be sick to drive
TopGear what is the song for this called?
TopGear The V8 Supercar looks sooo good.
TopGear Please add more new tracks for free and all cars avalaible in free play!
TopGear wtf a van real in a van in the a racing game. lol lol
TopGear Even though weve already had the majority of these cars previously, for the first time its a good group of cars
TopGear They need to add the chrysler pt cruiser and the range rover sport
TopGear should have got the 87 GNX lol take the weight of and spank both of them

TopGear what challenge is the old white jag from? I thought Id seen all episodes of Top Gear
TopGear the classic volvo saloon in the first race was has never been used in a top gear challenge so i don t know where they got that idea from
TopGear What class where they running?
TopGear would be awesome if someone could use a maurader
TopGear FailRace I have a vs the community idea do a budget not a high budget like 200k do something like the Ariel atom challenge however their is a flaw as you would never be sure if people actually spent the budget but its an idea that I hope you use in some way
TopGear Failrace vs the community in R1 cars
TopGear I never knew top gear ever used a mr2.
TopGear Some disqualifications might be necessary.
TopGear Q: Why do we only have 3 veiwers?A: Because your trying to drift in a VW Beetle!LOL

TopGear PLZ make a caterham r500 circuit build!!!!
TopGear I always drift interior
TopGear If you are gonna do top gear challenges, then please do it the way its suppose to be done. With factory stock cars, if they arent stock then it doesnt hold true to top gear challenges
TopGear oh yeah no m5 but c63 is better
TopGear You should do a challenge like that with old muscle cars
TopGear but nick... the c63 is a sports coupe not a sedan...
TopGear You are not an amazing driver are you use the driving line and also break when you didnt when need too
TopGear .....GODDAMNIT. THE CONSTANT SCREECHING OF TIRES.... Who the hell is doing that, HOW ARE YOU NOT KILLING EACH OTHER?!
TopGear hey dude we upload the same content and i almost have 1,000 subs maybe we could play together it would be an opportunity for both of us :)
TopGear I played this a lot back in the day and I remember it being the most unremarkable game Ive ever owned. It was the racing game with the hot dog car that was all I could remember, I actually realized that this was the game about two minutes into the review...Oh shit, I just realized I didnt own this, I owned the sequel Top Gear Overdrive.Okay, I guess I dont have memories of Top Gear Rally. Oops.
TopGear I love your yellow controller xD
TopGear I remember not knowing how to unlock stripminetook foreverwhich made me love the game even more
TopGear Thanks man! Now its time to play.
TopGear Hey nick in the future I plan on getting an xbox one and I would like for u to friend me on the list cause it looks like fun
TopGear But the ferrari is still more exciting and better looking.
TopGear if u wanna roll your car, go handbrake it in the corner after the second straight, you get more rolls.

TopGear Challenge, buy a 4x4 for under 50000 and start at the vinewood sign and end at paleto bay. The catch is that yo cannot use any roads and you must cross over the top of Mount Chiliad.
TopGear Let me be in the next one homie, i subbed an erything, gt: DeniedSkate3
TopGear Car vs boat vs plane and to win the person has to get to the specific spot first
TopGear I HAVE NOT BEEN SACKED, Ill be back in the next one.
TopGear Hello guys! Ive been watching since the first episode. Ive been wondering if I would be able to apply for a position to be your permanent 3rd guy. Im nature and know alot about cars. Ive watched every season on top gear so I know what Im doing.
TopGear Heres an idea, get 3 people, meet up at the airport. 2 people get in a plane and the other gets in any car of their choosing. Race to mount chillad but the plane users have to land at sandy shores airfield and take a car to the top of mount chillad. Hope you havefun!
TopGear You didnt give me credit for the challenge idea :(
TopGear get the dully form ovvee
TopGear Hey this is Jason Johnson and I am HUGE FAN of your videos !YOU ARE THE BEST AND CAN YOU DO A GRAND THEFT AUTO THE OF YOUR AWSOME VIDEOS!
TopGear I got spin tires and I need help putting deep and sticky mud on. I have put more trucks on. But dont know how to put the mud on.
TopGear Can u use the ford f250
TopGear If I added you would you take the friend request!
TopGear Thank you for taking my request on the super ram ToastyMustard
TopGear This is on Xbox One only, right? I ask because it looks like they improved the handling mechanics over previous games.
TopGear You did 62, 62100 kmh! 6098 kmh
TopGear i cant see it higher than 480P :c
TopGear Learn to shift before you drift!
TopGear Obviously when u switch from high powered drift machine to low powered drift machine is hard to drift because they both use different technique,if u watched the drift bible low powered car needs to drift on a high toque band so u can get the wheel spin
TopGear why dont we have the 720p option
TopGear the guy that bought the trueno sounds like fucking jesse eisenberg
TopGear Ar12gamingthat challange was my ideaim saiyanpotato
TopGear Where is the livestram?
TopGear GMC ALL DAY EVERY DAY
TopGear willieisthenewcaptonslow
TopGear That Miata should have Clarksons dually 6wheel design.
TopGear Any news on forza horizon 2
TopGear I thought it was top gear but all I get to see is a lame ass game
TopGear Hold on, Did I hear you say drifting with 200bhp is hard? Really? Well, I think you need to work on your techniques, using momentum and such, because if an 86 with 200bhp is hard to drift then either you arent running the right difficulty setting or you arent shifting the weight in the car correctly. You should be able to shift the weight with a feint or braking drift in an 86 easily.
TopGear I love the original game and find it very enjoyable and have to say I need this s I gotta be honest I totally prefer the street car racing over rallying! Also as you said its a fantastic looking game, off to Ebay I say! lol
TopGear I have many many fond memories of top gear rally and the paint shop! Great racing series!
TopGear I agree this is an impressive racer on the N64. A must have racer on the N64.
TopGear top gear rally is the best in the series for me top gear overdrive was ok but i much preferred ridge racer 64 but i think il give it another shot if i can find it cheap cool review glenn
TopGear Great review as always! This one is on my list :) hehe
TopGear wow the graphics look pretty good for a N64 game, I never heard of this one before... are there any hiccups in multiplayer or does it play smoothly?
TopGear I remember the shortcuts in this game were hard to find and I spent hours just finding them the time trial mode then trying to remember when I started the actual race
TopGear not one ive played tbh glenn, it looks pretty decent and the sense of speed I can tell is there
TopGear yeah.  I think Im gonna pass on this one.  I dont like to brag, but Im really good at racing games.  I can breeze through everything from Burnout to Fzero GX within a few hours.  With the way you built this game up, Id probably finish it in one sitting.
TopGear Top Gear Overdrive still cant quite live up to the legacy of the original, but its the best Top Gear game since then. With gorgeous graphics, excellent track design, fitting original music, fast and frantic races, great multiplayer racing, and a cool cashupgrade system, Top Gear Overdrive stands on its own as one of the N64s best racing experiences. Only the few problems of not enough tracks, lacking features, touchy control, and a difficulty setting thats a little too easy detract from the game. Otherwise, its a great game for both arcade racing fans and for those looking for something more akin to PlayStation racing games. A tremendous first effort by the small group at Snowblind Studios.
TopGear Why making a Gran Turismo like game for the N64 would never be impossible?N64 actually had some racing simulators, like some F1 games. In fact, in the 90s, if you wanted to play a F1 racing game simulator, you would need to buy a N64, because the PS1 just couldnt handle those games. The best ones were on the N64.Theres also World Driver Championship, which is a simulator just like Gran Turismo and, in terms of visuals and technology, is also far superior to any other racing game at the time.
TopGear Hey! This is an absolute amazing video! Your channel is absolutely amazing!I just started Youtube, and could use some comments and likes, do you mind checking out my channel? Thank you so much bro! I appreciate it, and keep up the excellent work!
TopGear Not enough speed for the grip that, that FRS has
TopGear Non potrei MAI annoiarmi!!!!...adoro questo tag!!!!....comunque AMO alla follia le galantine ...verissima la affermazione ke hai fatto...solo ki ha avuto un animale pu capire... :( un bacione grande!
TopGear Bellissimo il tuo TMI... e stupendo il trucco ...baci
TopGear Np ahah copier questa tua risposta in futuro hihi popolo del tubo svegliatevi che c una ragazza che merita veramente!!
TopGear Ciao! Scusa il disturbo..sono nuova su youtube, se vuoi passa! Grazie!!  :)
GameSack glad I found this, makes playing him even better :D
GameSack This was the first thing I heard when i logged into league of legends. I was like, WOW THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE AWESOME!!!
GameSack Man this brings up memories, there was sooo much hype around this. S3 championship is gonna be awesome too if riot uses this kind of music, builds up so much hype.
GameSack The reason I love this song is because it sounds like a teemo in a supersonic washing machine.
GameSack Damn washing machine.
GameSack Feel like want to hide in bushes and stalk the people.Pack up weapons and leave
GameSack watch?vYYgmdhsrPu4 Thats where Riot took the idea. Im laughing so hard.
GameSack TRRRRRUUUN TUNTUNTUNTUNTUTUN!! TANANANANANNAN TATANANANANAN atataannnanaanananaaaa Tun TUN !
GameSack Guys click me and see my rengar music and comment!
GameSack DUM DUM DURURUR DUM DUM
GameSack Rengar  Draven bro :p
GameSack i think its like protoype claw and blade
GameSack here mousy mousy mousy
GameSack Plus the Kha Zix spikes on his shoulder, haha!
GameSack One of my favourite champions
GameSack Kinda Transformer style.... Epic song, but I still think PFEzreal theme is the best.
GameSack Need 10 hour version !
GameSack Vis isnt considered music, this is.
GameSack I play my league games with this song
GameSack it has Hans Zimmer feeling :D (dark knight, inception, pirates, potter etc.)
TopGear Add a message to your video
GameSack Lmfaoooooo at the end
GameSack I love it when Steve goes crazy!
GameSack TheWillofDC I think the volume is a pretty good level now
GameSack On the topic of Video giveaways i think its kinda silly that Youtube is trying to stop it. A lot of people have stopped watching TV over the years because of sites like Youtube and i think more and more people will continue to do so. However TV still allows giveaways and GameShows and i think if Internet is truly going to replace TV then we need to embrace that type of content as well. I was very disappointed to find out that my channel cant be accepted as a partner because its a gameshow
GameSack Riot Games just gave away a free skin and champion (which would normally be like 20 dollars all together) to everyone for just subscribing to there already popular YouTube channel. I think its perfectly fine.
GameSack Is Collective Digital Studio something like Makers Studio?
GameSack JamesBerg86 thx! will do!
GameSack I think what Steve is trying to say is that the FreddieW contributors are not donating to a nonprofit, they are investing in a forprofit. Whenever you invest in a for profit, and it does well, you receive a return on that investment. So what is the return? Videos? That seems a little weak. He could just rent his videos for that matter. Because I could invest in anything from savings to the market and receive anywhere from .0001 to at least 5 in return.
GameSack 2:50 misspelled freddiew
GameSack Youtube ISNT a government body. What Riot did WASNT ILLEGAL. The way its established is verified by Youtube itself so that you CAN UNDER YOUR OWN FREE WILL, SUBSCRIBE. Youtube ISNT POLITICS, God.
GameSack u guys are wrong about riot lol
GameSack I dont know if you remember Will but at the start of this yearend of last year you predicted that RWJ would pass RyanHiga interms of Subscribers, and you were spot on. And a couple of videos ago you predicted that Freddiew might surpass RWJ. I think you are going to be right once again considering what freddiew is doing atm.
GameSack FreddieW should just make the movie better with that extra money. Steve, your evil laugh is coming along. Have you chosen your evil villain name?
GameSack Your production value has increased quite a bit. I would like to suggest you try different micing. Record your sound in a different way.
GameSack Will what Steve was trying to say is that Freddie is already making tons of money off his videos alone. So to ask for another 75K, seems to beg the question, what should be done with the money he was already making off youtube videos? Further more, why did Freddie need to raise an extra 75K? Youre telling me he couldnt finance the series out of his own pocket? BS. Freddie is a top youtuber, he could have easily financed with the money hes made off youtube already. So why the extra 75K?
GameSack Steve is like Wills personal troll XD
GameSack wills wearing a smosh, ask charlie tshirt
GameSack TheWillofDC Will there are plenty of partners who do giveaways everyday of the week, I know Phillip DeFranco does it on his show everyday. I do not know who has gotten banned for doing this, Im sure you are more knowledgeable about the situations than myself. Riot games didnt actually gain or lose anything. If you look at it like this, Riot games could have easily just had 100k people join youtube that wasnt already there and all and all isnt it about the community?
GameSack Y U NO talk about theneedledrop winning On The Rise? It was such a close competition!
GameSack I love the way he has made a lovely intro and spent time and effort to make a wonderful set and then chosen to film it all from an angle that shows off the wires and folded up curtain in the corner. A few more back boards wouldnt go a miss there Will, maybe a little fillerpaint to get rid of that distracting line in the middle of the set. :)
GameSack Is Jenna Marbles that good?
GameSack what about fpsrussia and epicmealtime?
GameSack jennamarbles is awesome !
GameSack wedgeii2 The only way I know of is going to the top right corner beside the video, on your homepage, and clicking the x. It might be a glitch, in which case, your only option is to wait it out.

TopGear vas a subir locos por los autos
TopGear HE WAS REFERRING TO THE BRIDHE YOU FUCKING SLOPE!!!!!
TopGear Somi Guha is racist in herself because she knows that the word slope has been a basic, core word for hundreds of years and has no ethical meaning in the slightest yet because the presenters are white theyre easy targets to accuse of racism. If we took offence at the Chinese word for flat for example Im sure theyll think were idiots if we try to sue them for having the word flat in a chinese TV show.
TopGear I didnt even know the word slope had other meanings until all this palaver, but having heard that I now find this segment hilarious.
TopGear Whats wrong with harmless jokes this is why I hate the modern nanny state when you cant say this you cant say that they cant just police free speech plus only a few people complained so why should the media give a fuck
TopGear Absolutely pathetic. never even heard the term, and if that was a joke, it was a pretty cryptic one. Furthermore, SOMI, i assume the word slope doesnt even apply to people of your own ancestry (and cant claim the whole of asia is offended by it). If anyone from Burma wishes to complain, let them do so. Why is she watching topgear anyway if she doesnt like jokes. And BTW the Texas trip would be a whole lot more offensive to Texans but amazingly none of them decided to sue the BBC wonder why (presumably because they arent so meanspirited and pathetic).
TopGear The lawsuit is stupid and Id be surprised if she won anything. Having said that, anyone who thinks Jeremy DIDNT know what he was doing when he said but...theres a slope on the bridge (while an Asian man was walking on it) is kidding themselves. It was an obvious jab at another race and Im sorry I had to witness that from someone I thought was a better man than that.
TopGear Big woop, get over it
TopGear Fuck off Somi, get a life, you idiot!! Viva Clarkson!!!
TopGear Lmao and people wonder why racism will never die... Because people like this will keep using it for their own personal agenda. 1 million, how about earn your own fucking money, and stop watching too gear you slope
TopGear umm how is this racist lmao
TopGear isnt it funny when actuall truckers watch this thinking finally big trucks then this happened
TopGear Hahaha wait let me check my watch let me check my phone.
TopGear Dafuq happened to their voices?
TopGear Love to have the peterbilt
TopGear thats their Cb handle
TopGear Why do all your videos have the bottom cropped off and all stretched and distorted. Not watchable. Super low definition. May as well not even upload them.
TopGear voices are lower and its disturbing
TopGear Would subscribe if you dont mess with the voices
TopGear i dont care how bad the quality is. free episodes!
TopGear An Aerostar?!?! Im so disappointed in you Tanner...
TopGear Finally i can watch full eps
TopGear Subaru legacy Gtb estate 170mph for 1500...
TopGear I wanna see the corvette drift
TopGear Do your self a favor,watch british topgear.Omg they just copy the british version, no new ideas.Terrible waste of time
TopGear Yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
TopGear The trick is to lower the air pressure in the tires.
TopGear Why the distorted low quality video?
TopGear This Chevy might not be the fastest but it sure did save everybodys ass more than once. Thats a Chevy for ya! :)
TopGear Really, the stock IH 345 replaced by a Chrysler 318, idiots!
TopGear WHY THE FUCK CANT WE GET GOOD QUALITY??!!
TopGear I dont know which is worse, the sped up voices so they sound like chipmunks, or the slowed down voices like on this video so they sound like its all dubbed. This blows. Why cant anyone post videos like the UK show videos? I need to just buy the series if I can find it.
TopGear im sorry why is a range rover shit the normal top gear uses them as film cars they go everywhere and fyi the best off roader is a defender
TopGear what about the bmw x5? that thing rolls very nicely.
TopGear What is the music at 27:27?Who does it? It sounds awesome!
TopGear Tanner is horrible with girls XD Im pretty sure he is just acting :p Top Gear UK is so such much better though!
TopGear Love the Boxter, but seeing it here it just screams midlife crisis. The corvette is the classier one period.
TopGear That Ucra is no Super Car, a Super Car must do it all, be nice, handle great, fast as hell with all modern conveniences such as AC, heater, stereo and a ROOF.
TopGear Ive bitched and moaned about the voices so much, but ya know something?... I love this show so much, Ive discovered I no longer really care. The only part that still gets me is how the camera sort of shows the sky and not the action a dozen or so times per video.. that part still sucks. lol
TopGear Tanner is a drifter. So what. Hes an arrogant 53 punk. Adam is an actor from New York where everyone takes a taxi. Rudledge is a cool, nice genuine guy.
TopGear that dodge is awesome
TopGear american cars really r no good 4 anything
TopGear Bacana ein? Show... eu era bom demais nesse jogo. O foda era anotar os password num papel pra jogar em um outro dia... kkkkk
TopGear Vertical video is a sin.
TopGear I am reading yours tweets guys and just laughing myself :D Does even Richard know this?
TopGear I hope youve got your running shoes (or a folding bike) James!
TopGear Uhm, I dont understand english very well, anyone can transcribe what James is saying at the end?
TopGear THIS IS GONNA BE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear Yes please! But dont vertical film again
TopGear andasyoucouldhaveimaginedivedonethisproperlythis could be a nice hashtag..
TopGear Are the respective pilots aware of this race? Loving it. Tweets cheering my day up no end. But Champagne and hula hoops?
TopGear Hamster in a suitcase in a cargoplane?
TopGear Goodluck chaps.May the best manmachine win!
TopGear Come on, Captain Slow!
TopGear i remember watching this interview (full and HD) somewhere else, cant remember exactly where. why it wasnt broadcasted anyway?BTW thanks for uploading it!!! Loved how he said ...your accent youre so sneaky with American accent.
TopGear Well even if you recorded this and part 2 with your Android and hands, its all good, because your the only one Im able to find with the full interview. So thank you :)
TopGear He does not like coming second.
TopGear What is this song called?
TopGear those speakers are so annoying, love the Chernobyl vid though
TopGear I hv them water speakers
TopGear Surprised to see the V8 pass the GT3 on the straight, or am I missing something?
TopGear Lol how about you show the good people whole race. After 3 laps Erebus got their arse handed to them by the Super bike, Red Bull F1, and the Time Attack Mitsubishi Evo. The bike came first, Evo and F1 equal second and the Merc 3rd by a long shot followed by the GT3 Merc and WRC Corolla.
TopGear Get in the cockpit of a MercedesBenz SLS GT3 race an E63 V8 at the Sydney Motorsport Park.
TopGear Awsome video Karim ! Thanks for uploading it ! Keep up the good work !
TopGear 9:24.... Oh.. baby....daddy like.
TopGear What song is that in the very beginning? I MUST KNOW
TopGear Richard driving god Hammond.. Who remembers that from one of the early series? LOL
TopGear llllloooooll the end where the nissan gtr goes

ZONEofTECH daniel ur videos are so coolur so coollets be friends
ZONEofTECH Oh my god it is the amazing Spiderman. :D
ZONEofTECH Solar seams the most practical
ZONEofTECH Speak italian...PLEASE
ZONEofTECH This should solve Americas obesity problem!!!!
ZONEofTECH Sapphire can shatter fairly easily, so it may not respond well to drops. Its fantastic for avoiding scratches as anyone with a nice watch can tell you.
ZONEofTECH Shouldnt forget water proof swimming is a sport to
ZONEofTECH I hate how people are so worried about battery life. You charge your phone every night, is it that hard to just plug a cord in along with your phone?
ZONEofTECH I hate how people are so worried about battery life. You charge your phone every night, is it that hard to just plug a cord in along with your phone?
ZONEofTECH i dont think they will use solar powered cuz wat if its snowing and there is no sun?
ZONEofTECH The song is new game by nitro fun
ZONEofTECH Ok Im gonna say it. Dude you look so much like the actor Andrew Garfield. He played in The SocialNetwork and The Amazing Spiderman
ZONEofTECH why do you promote stuff like clarence and cell phone companies
ZONEofTECH Is that a bit of repeated footage on the sapphire I think it is
ZONEofTECH Movement and solar charging would be a good combination
ZONEofTECH No thats for the iPhone 6
ZONEofTECH Smart watches are useless, why not do things the old fashioned way? Its really not necessary to have a smart watch..
ZONEofTECH I want to see on the Apple iWatch I want to see people calling each other and possibility txt on it idk maybe
ZONEofTECH i like your videos man keep up the good work
ZONEofTECH I would say the 2 is soooo AWESOME!!!! )
ZONEofTECH I like the thick band idea of Concept 2... But Concept 5 looks the most plausible
ZONEofTECH I actually like the one better than two because it is more practical, but two is still amazing
ZONEofTECH of course i would pick 2 but we all know that can take a while until it is made but if i would choose a concept that can be ma with the technology and engineering that we have today, then i would pick concept 3
ZONEofTECH I think I like 5 best lol
ZONEofTECH think number 2 will come out in 150 years
ZONEofTECH can you talk about the new mac book pro 2014?
ZONEofTECH I love number 2 But number 1 is the moste realistic
ZONEofTECH ma favorite in 2 ! luv it :)
ZONEofTECH Number 5 and 2 are sick
ZONEofTECH there is a problem with the concepts... wheres the headphone jack?
ZONEofTECH i would buy number 2 the moment it comes out
ZONEofTECH i had tons of fun watching this!
ZONEofTECH i like number 1 concept,,,
ZONEofTECH I think 4 needs to be longer...lol
ZONEofTECH 1  2 iPhone 6 CONCEPT
ZONEofTECH I can even understand what their saying because their accents
ZONEofTECH Number 4 is kinda silly
ZONEofTECH How can u use no 4 as a phone though :
ZONEofTECH Is the 4th one a phone or a dildo
ZONEofTECH that guy holding the iphone as virtual guitar is Babak Ferdosi the guy working for NASA , he was a part of curiosity mission to Mars :D
ZONEofTECH i have seen the number 2 spot many times before and its deffenetly my favorit
ZONEofTECH Sorry but all of the iPhone 6 videos are a complete lie an when you reply I will tell you why
ZONEofTECH Would be amazing if they would make it like 1
ZONEofTECH 2 is my favorite. We need that. I mean if me have google glass we can have that
ZONEofTECH I love on 4 when the guy uses it as a ruler and markes the wall with a pencil it doesnt even touch the wall or make a mark XD
ZONEofTECH Almost 200.000 views and 2243 LIKES!!I simply have no words for this!Youre all amazing! A thank you simply isnt enough..So Ill go with a bolded THANK YOU!:)
ZONEofTECH Omg you look like Andrew Garfield! Hawt.
ZONEofTECH Aluminium? lolz great vid
ZONEofTECH Because apple didnt have screen cracking issues before. Now they are going with a stiffer, more brittle display. Which means that as soon as it touches anything, its just going to spontaneously blow out
ZONEofTECH Yea ill be waiting for the Iphone 6s
ZONEofTECH What is Apple trying to do make a phone into paper?
ZONEofTECH No it is grapine I bet half of you guys nevrer heard of it
ZONEofTECH Yea a new iphone! Now that should do with my 5s? make a video of different ways to destroy it ! :)
ZONEofTECH Great effort in putting leaks and rumours together!
ZONEofTECH Hey look! Its jeff gordon!
ZONEofTECH wireless charging? are you crazy?
ZONEofTECH You look like spider man
ZONEofTECH He looks so much like Andrew Garfield lol
ZONEofTECH Is it me or do you look a lot like Andrew Garfield?
ZONEofTECH I need to get a joooobbbbb
ZONEofTECH Good thing I got no contract on my galaxy s5 to switch on this baby if its any good when it releases
ZONEofTECH Apple is stupid, they could have released a bigger screen with the same resolution years ago, the PS Vita has slightly lower res but is quite a bit larger (5) and still looks great.
ZONEofTECH I was paying attention, as a matter of fact i paid too much attention. What you have to understand is that the bigger the phone and faster the processor it can still drain the battery just as fast even when they say youll get 12 hours video playback (that doesnt mean anything especially if you havent got a real life experience with the phone yet) and sometimes those promising phones dont live up to those expectations. Dont believe the hype and everything you hear, research it first.
ZONEofTECH Does anyone else feel Samsung always rushes into launching their new technology slightly too fast? :
ZONEofTECH Should of made a red one :(
ZONEofTECH Looks nice... not THAT MUCH of a difference, but then again Im still using the GS3 cause I didnt see much of an incentive to get the 4... maybe Ill get the GS5 or the Note 3 (If only theyd come out with a GS with a built in Spen).I really dont get the complaints about the plastic backs.... 1st: If you DONT put your smartphone in a case, youre a flippin idiot, so what does it matter what the back looks like 2nd: THANK GOD I can remove the back case to change out batteries AND additional SD cards... again, you have to be an idiot to buy a phone that is sealed with no way of expanding memory or easily putting in a fresh or new battery and 3rd: WHY would any intelligent and practical person PREFER to have the extra weight of a metal brick in their pocket (what, that huge new phone isnt heavy enough for you?) and WHY would any intelligent and practical person want a phone surrounded by glass all around (that new expensive gadget isnt delicate enough for you?) and 4th: why would any practical person prefer a more expensive phone just because its wrapped in stainless steel or aluminum when it will just be covered up in a PLASTIC protective case anyway... DUH. It just comes down to shallow vanity... and besides, you look like idiots covering up your TOO delicate, TOO heavy, and TOO expensive fruits with those GIANT Otter case within a case within a case within a case.... I LOVE my GS3... and although the GS5 isnt an earth shattering new model, all I truly look for is: ram, memory, battery sizelife WITH easy access, and SD card capable... and Samsung has delivered in ALL the truly important areas, with the added beauty of their HD screen and camera.My ONLY regret is that its a Googleandroid phone... I used to love Google, but I have grown to HATE Google in the past couple of years, with that hate growing more and more every passing day. With as much as I love Samsung GalaxiesNotes... I have to confess that my disdain of Google is pushing me towards an iPhone or Windows phone in my future. Google seems to have gone off the deep end and seems to THINK that we LIKE being dragged with them eventhough were kicking and screaming the whole time... they have gone blind, deaf, and dumb to us regular users... they have shown they simply dont care about us anymore... they are no longer our heros... they have become our oppressive captors instead... am I the only one who remembers that same tyranny from Microsoft in the Nineties???Google SERIOUSLY needs to get back to their roots and remind themselves of what made them so different and so beloved in the first place.
ZONEofTECH it doesnt even look well presented i got bored ...
ZONEofTECH Skip to 2000 to skip music intro and music
ZONEofTECH This is major disappointment after a great phone like S4, what were they thinking with the band aid design?
ZONEofTECH Lmao.. The David park guy had to clap for himself for people to cheer..... hahaha
ZONEofTECH TheRandomActivity first off iphones will always sell more that copycat samsung and dont fucking argue with that because its very clear who copied who. All i gotta do is look at the homebutton on the iphone and galaxys and know that samsung was inspired by apple. And by the way what makes samsung better? Useless features lol cmon the iphone can do pretty much everything samsung still cant do when its jailbroken. Samsung still cant fix their lag and their phones break much faster than iphones
ZONEofTECH its quite hilarious watching the 12 year old stone aged isheep kids bash and troll the galaxy which is clearly in every area better than your icrap, yous cant handle yourselves can you? your iphone days are dead little ones, the battle is moving towards the android OEMS now, not stone age devices which were very similar for 7 years LMAO!
ZONEofTECH galaxy s5 a keen disappointment
ZONEofTECH i have iphone 4 ios 5.1.1 and i update my iphone to ios 7.0.6 from iphone setting and now i have apple logo on and off, can u fix it
ZONEofTECH Samsung has nothing new but a better camera on the new phone. Apple will once again out sell Samsung because Apple actually have something new to offer. If the iphone 6 has a 5 inch screen...game over. Cant wait to get the 6 and the awesome iwatch coming out.
ZONEofTECH Samsung Galaxy S5Specs, Camera, Features,Price  Release date!
ZONEofTECH guy you cant assume when the phone drops in just a week but you still get a like just to help the channel
ZONEofTECH Can u help me root my s4 19505 qualcomm updated to 4.3 thanks

ZONEofTECH Can u help me root my s4 19505 qualcomm updated to 4.3 thanks
ZONEofTECH Keep up the awesome videos. :)
ZONEofTECH Over 10 hours of editing and this is the result!Samsung Galaxy S5, Galaxy Gear 2 and the NEW Galaxy Tab 4 :)
ZONEofTECH Gear fit Rocks!!!!!! love gear fit design!!!
ZONEofTECH S to the question of whether the Galaxy gear 1 was a prototype or if the Galaxy gear 2 is a rushed replacement, I can think of a third option. The galaxy gear 1 was a test of sorts. It wasnt a prototype as you indicated, but rather a concept test to see what the market was before ramping up production and RD. It is likely that Samsung was developing multiple versions of the Galaxy gear at the same time. The gear 1 was only a proof of concept model to generate interest in such a device. The gear 2 will be the culmination of the original design and the feedback from the gear 1. This means Samsung wouldnt have had to redesign from scratch in only 5 months, instead, they would have been designing since the RD department first proposed the gear concept. My guess is that the gear 2 has more than a year of design and development under its hood.
ZONEofTECH cant wait for the revel of the S5
ZONEofTECH its the same bullshit leak lies every year... thumbs down for tard video!
ZONEofTECH good ,My online shops have ,
ZONEofTECH Why all the dislikes this is a great video
ZONEofTECH I think that its the type of design apple will use. Im not sure about it being real
ZONEofTECH its funny how people speculate how a new devise will look but when it comes out it looks totally different
ZONEofTECH It is going to be the same as all of the others they never Change. The galaxy is way better
ZONEofTECH oh and 2 GB of ram and quadcore.
ZONEofTECH My mom still uses her NOKIA 6110, what is the big deal about all these IPHONE and Samsung?? as long as you can send messages, make calls and received calls all are fine, nokia old phone and my old trusty motorola which are key pads phone are good and made for people who are honest folks, you can text while having a dump, while eating, while driving, while talking to someone with your fingers instinctively knowing where to press, while masturbating, HELL I can even stroke my girlfriends twat and suck on her breasts and ass, having sex while looking and texting on my trusty motorola phone..what is the big deal about all these Iphone and Galaxy??? it is expensive, goes out fashion in a flash, this is just a way for these people to cheat our hard earned money for things we do not really need...if you want to check out the internet and work on your computers just stick to your PC or laptop...bunch of nonsense, this is the classic story as depicted in the Stephen Kings horror novel Needful Things you people are sad people, havent got a life??? just waiting for the latest phones from these big companies cheating on peoples money...GET A LIFE YOU SAD MISERABLE PEOPLE, there are better things to do than to comment of what is and when is the next phone coming!!!!
ZONEofTECH omg it looks exactly like the samsung thats so stupid
ZONEofTECH Thats retarded. It looks like an Android.
ZONEofTECH Ill slAp some 1 if they buy this shit
ZONEofTECH The 3.5 inch display is perfect, I hope they dont increase it more then 4 inches.
ZONEofTECH it is called CONCEPT...!
ZONEofTECH What is the point of making another iPhone when you could just keep on making updates and features for the original iPhone?
ZONEofTECH Looks like someone put a iphone button on a gs4
ZONEofTECH Good quality video!!! All is good.... Info, audio, video, etc... Good job!!
ZONEofTECH Iphone 6 looks the same to me.It just little bit bigger.I think Samsung Galaxy S5 is better than up coming Iphone 6.Thats my opinion.
ZONEofTECH fake ! iphone fans keep dreaming !!!!  waiting for the samsung s5
ZONEofTECH The iPhone 6 looks like a samsung galaxy to me
ZONEofTECH So...completely off topic, but anyone else notice this guy looks like David Tennant and Andrew Garfield had a baby?

ZONEofTECH Hi, please could you do a gaming review? Thanks
ZONEofTECH Hi I just got the 2.6ghz, 1 terabyte ssd. 15 MacBook pro yesterday. This thing is powerful. For premiere pro and after effects, I had to download the nvidia cuda unlock. I cant believe how smooth it runs with multiple effects. I am very happy with this machine. Final cut pro runs like a champ too. However, mts files must be transcoded. I gotta try few games and see how it performs.
ZONEofTECH 4:20 The developers were racist HAHAHA XD
ZONEofTECH How many FPS can that produce with high setting for games with high graphic needs (like Saint Row IV  Hitman Absolution)?
ZONEofTECH Is this a for review onlygiveawayable(?) or your own macbook?

ZONEofTECH For some reason the phone looks used.
ZONEofTECH Please make a review about the new macbook pro retina 13 :)
ZONEofTECH You can say  now shut up and watch
ZONEofTECH Japanese is after French at the start screen.
ZONEofTECH video: review how to use your fingerprint when its locked on the iphone 5s
ZONEofTECH Are you willing to give away that iphone 5S cause I really need a phone.
ZONEofTECH Definitely the iPad Air makes it for me out of all the Appple announcements. Im still nursing my Ipad 1 and have been waiting for a serious reason to upgrade and I think the Air does it! Thanks for the informed synopsis.
ZONEofTECH Hey Daniel its pretty cool apple has the softwares free and I also liked iPad mini with upgraded retina display with I guess the same price
ZONEofTECH Hey Ben, What discount do you mean? MacBook discount or Apple software discounts (keep in mind that those are free now with every new Mac).
ZONEofTECH iPhone 4S vs Nokia Lumia 925!Who WINS and who LOSES?
ZONEofTECH Shit! Boot up test Tells NOTHING, only if the phone has the same OS! Some people think the Nokia would be faster, because of the faster boot! I got news for ya its not! )
ZONEofTECH MichelTello26 Can I fuck you too, Im seventh! )
ZONEofTECH Why does the description say S4?
ZONEofTECH I really need that Galaxy s4
ZONEofTECH Samsung phones  plastic shits
ZONEofTECH Make a review of the iphone 5c :)
ZONEofTECH Thanks ZT,I learn a lot,By watching your vedeo,keep on going.
ZONEofTECH Price for the case has gone up to 9.95
ZONEofTECH Awsome I realy need an iPhone 5c so bad
ZONEofTECH I would like a PC version :)
ZONEofTECH blue iphone 5C Id be honored and would love to watch your videos even more than I already do so I hope I win and thankyou soooo much

ZONEofTECH NEW VIDEO!iPhone 5C vs 4S  BOOT TEST
ZONEofTECH Do you mind but can you tell what me(us) what song you use?
ZONEofTECH The music is too loud
ZONEofTECH The real winner is the galaxy S4. Im not joking, I see in slow motion.
ZONEofTECH The boot test doesnt matter if theres nothing to actually boot up praglom kidsom
ZONEofTECH Stock? You mean stock android?
ZONEofTECH Boot up Test Shows in no way, the speed of a device only if they have the same os!
ZONEofTECH That wasnt as big a blow out as I thought it would be
ZONEofTECH Why is his iPhone 5c 1.25 GHz mine is 1.30 Ghz
ZONEofTECH Nice video, I actually own a 4S 32gb and Im trying to see if its time to change it for a 5C! Im satisfied with my 4S but I like very much the 5C design. This was very informative, but Im still in the process of what to do. However Ill probably wait until they announce the iPhone 6, which I dont think Ill buy cause its gonna be too big for me, then ill buy a 5S instead hoping on a cheaper than now!
ZONEofTECH I have an iphone 4 but Im getting a 5c in 26 days
ZONEofTECH my iPod touch 5th gen took 33 secs interesting
ZONEofTECH I think the iphone 4s looks so much better. I dont care if he is a little bit slow.
ZONEofTECH The hone 5c is crap no one likes it
ZONEofTECH iphone 5c won at 28 seconds
ZONEofTECH 1GB  1024 MB neither the iphone 5S has a 1GB RAM
ZONEofTECH This video doesnt make any sense we all know the 5c is faster since it has the A6 Chip and the iPhone 4s has the A5 Chip
ZONEofTECH I have the iPhone 5c and its just like the iPhone 5 and it Actually feels nice in the hand not cheap at all and I like the improve meant in the camera overall this phone is worth it
ZONEofTECH oh god peter parker of the amazing spiderman!
ZONEofTECH Lol!! Screw you!!! The poly carbonate dint help the iphone 5c!!! Its too damn flashy and looks a bit funny!! Coming to technical views 4s is much better than 5c!! Pretty boy grow up!!! 4s is a Steve Jobs revolutionary product!! :) 4s is still a good phone than 5c :)
ZONEofTECH Obviously the 5c is quicker its got a faster processor so this test is just pointless
ZONEofTECH Which one is louder .?
ZONEofTECH Im just saying its fast
ZONEofTECH This quite a pointless comparison with the only difference being IOS 7 instead of IOS 6. We all know the iPhone 5C beats the 4S quite comfortably in every speed test this guy did. Personally I would get the 5S.. I have a 4S currently and its beginning to show its age since the IOS 7.0.4 update.
ZONEofTECH So does that mean i can talk faster on iPhone 5C?
ZONEofTECH isnt a fair test! put ios 6 on iphone 4s, and test again! ios 7 is rubish!
ZONEofTECH Nice video  I luv the music in Boot time test can u reply what it is? :)
ZONEofTECH Um excuse the iphone5c red is pink did you notice that
ZONEofTECH iPhone 5s Space GreyiPhone 5c Yellow
ZONEofTECH waiting for iphone 6 x :))

ZONEofTECH Hallo is Dutch. :) I think the one you didnt know too was Korean! Nice first look!
ZONEofTECH Is it possible to take a long picture in a way..?
ZONEofTECH 5C is the worst Iphone model yet. Do not buy it. You are wasting a upgrade.
ZONEofTECH Im getting the the same one phone when my mom gets income tax in February

ZONEofTECH Prfftttt...i cant breath from
ZONEofTECH Thx Jake :) Im giving one away! The giveaway video is up! Good luck :) Who knows? You might not even have to get one for Christmas :)
ZONEofTECH I kinda like the 5C, would consider buying it although Id love the 5S, but may be outta my price range. the specs for the C were better than i was even owing. The white 5C would be the only one Id consider though not so keen on the colors. Thanks for the video man, good work )
ZONEofTECH Lol!!! 56x faster THAN ORIGINAL IPHONE!!! That is iPhone 1, not 56x faster than iPhone 5...
ZONEofTECH Yes, I did add an annotation to correct that.
ZONEofTECH Hey great video man but those figures that say 40X and 56X are the improvements it has had since the original iPhone .. Just a heads up!
ZONEofTECH Great video man like all of them! Got all the info for the upcoming iphone ) Detailed and informative! I subscribed to you and shared your channel :D
ZONEofTECH Thx :) I do hope so. I wanted to be as detailed as possible. Unfortunately I dont have that many views at the moment :( , so a share and like would greatly be appreciated :) Cheers! Dan ZONEofTECH
ZONEofTECH What does the Galaxy S4 do? Serious question.
ZONEofTECH Sir Color Blue Thanks :))
ZONEofTECH Nice video dude! Like all of them daniel
ZONEofTECH You look like Andrew Garfield!
ZONEofTECH Go back to the 1950s old man! Any nonparinoid person would buy one.
ZONEofTECH What do you expect? Hes korean and his native language is not english.
ZONEofTECH I do try to reply to as many questions as I can, especially to people like you, who only ask serious and important questions. I really hate it when I work 10h for a video, especially when I am in the middle of nowhere and work my as.s to find a McDonalds to upload a video, and that video still gets more dislikes than likes, simply because people did not read the title. I believe you know which video I am talking about. :(
ZONEofTECH when will you announce the winner of the iPhone 5C. and when you do can you message me back telling who the winner is thank you for your time
ZONEofTECH I love it how people CANT read the title and spam the dislike button.... READ THE TITLE: This is the event announcement....NOT the event...Jesus...
ZONEofTECH Mines the 17th now :D
ZONEofTECH nope, and stop insulting 7 year olds
ZONEofTECH Android is fucking poopoo.
ZONEofTECH In that case, still better than shit  crap.
ZONEofTECH Haha, that must be why :D Fandroids are so ridiculous .
ZONEofTECH Its an Android fangirlboy, who doesnt realize the quality of Apple phones with their metal casing compared to Androids cheap plastic casing.
ZONEofTECH Still the same garbage
ZONEofTECH Nice video cant wait for the ipod touch 6g
ZONEofTECH I would like to say to people who want iOS 7 it is semi available to developers and those who know how to update with downloaded firmware. But it will hopefully be released soon but the current beta is less glitchy on the 4S in my opinion
ZONEofTECH Andrew garfield is that you?
ZONEofTECH iOS 7 will be released on September 10, and the new iPhones will be released on the 17th, the other products next march.
ZONEofTECH I Have a ,Samsung But I am thinking iPhone
ZONEofTECH Im have a samsung galaxy S4 and an ipad Samsung and appple rule Nokia suck
ZONEofTECH are companies allowed to go at each other like that ? isnt that unprofessional ?
ZONEofTECH Lumia 1020 it is! Dont freakin fight. Switch.
ZONEofTECH How is this the same? First of all we dont know the price yet. Secondly, the Mac Pro is all about performance, and this thing runs circles around the old one. Lastly, the 6 thunderbolt 2.0 ports allow for unheard of expansion in capabilities. So whats with the same shit?
ZONEofTECH The same shit and more expensive thats the main difference
ZONEofTECH Cheap my ass i love it
ZONEofTECH How much is iPhone 5c
ZONEofTECH I guess you guys cant speak Chinese
ZONEofTECH Its cheap but apple never makes bad quality stuff. The plastic back doesnt even really feel like plasstic and for 100 its a great price
ZONEofTECH in my country this cell phone cost 1100 dolars
ZONEofTECH if you live in a different country its not dollars.
ZONEofTECH plz let me win because me cousin is braggin about her iphone 4s so i want a iphone 5 to rub it in her face

ZONEofTECH Fake Thats Not a Xbox On Thats The PS3
ZONEofTECH You look like CaptainSparklez )
ZONEofTECH I have used to my galaxy s4 for professional photoshoots and my models have loved it but I need to get myself a DSLR to expand my repertoire...
ZONEofTECH When I take a picture with a highlight out the sun, it turns everything dark to try to reduce light. Is there a way to stop that.
ZONEofTECH 4th viewer! 2nd comment!!!! 4th viewer?? wait...waht?
ZONEofTECH I do have the galaxy s4 i9500 and i love everything about the camera except 3 things (1. Video recording stabilization 2. Noisy voice when recording video 3. Slowing auto focus)
ZONEofTECH GREAT video! I rarelly post coments to videos. Congratulations. I love the S4. Great photos for a smartphone. A lesson that Apple should learn...
ZONEofTECH Nothing bad about plastic phones
ZONEofTECH They would sell this plastic iPhone, alongside the iPhone 5  5S. So they wont switch to plastic entirely. Only the cheaper iPhone 5C will be made out of plastic.
ZONEofTECH i think the cc stans for colour
ZONEofTECH I love your videos, but please post more tutorials and videos not related to the Galaxy S4!
ZONEofTECH u should case tests that would be really cool
ZONEofTECH Awsome video man and review the Nexus 7:)
ZONEofTECH Mine doesnt do that anymore. Please help):

ZONEofTECH dude you look like Andrew Garfield :) cheers.
ZONEofTECH whats up love the vids
ZONEofTECH when doing this, say if my moniter is larger than my laptop screen and im using word, does the monitor have the ability to show more or the word document, or is it just expanded and blown up to fit the screen?
ZONEofTECH thanks a lot, really i need connect my macbook pro to big display monitor i feel frustration when i try to work on logic pro
ZONEofTECH It works for me but the audio doesnt any suggestions

ZONEofTECH I have the Note 3 and my shit never ever works. Been in the tutorial it never works. Glad it just isnt me.
ZONEofTECH Do phones cost more in Romania or the US
ZONEofTECH Theres no way that thats an actually Apple product. It look just like a custom casing for an iPhone 5 some company came up with.
ZONEofTECH Arruinaron el iphone con el video de hasta el final
ZONEofTECH They should stay with the metallic features the plastic and translucent iPhone make it look cheap and too fragile
ZONEofTECH I actually kinda want it.
ZONEofTECH Kinda :) but with a plastic back instead of an aluminium back. And thinker....way thicker (thats what she said!!!!)
ZONEofTECH Yeah, it does look pretty awesome to be honest :)
ZONEofTECH It looks like shit who will buy it. I would rather give 1000 euros for an iphone 5s than that shit ps im 11 and i have an iphone 5 and i will never get that piece of shit
ZONEofTECH Hmm, not that far away to be honest. Ukraine is the only country separating us (that sounded really weird hahha). Im glad you like my videos! Dont forget to like,share (all that good stuff....) and SUBSCRIBE to my channel for more EPIC videos ! :D
ZONEofTECH Let me guess, you installed it on an iPhone 4. Am I right? :)

ZONEofTECH Restart your device to check again
ZONEofTECH rename the file. erase .DMG and change it to .IPSW :)
ZONEofTECH did u jailbreak your phone?
ZONEofTECH You only need beta 2 installed. To get beta 2 you need beta 1 and for beta 1 you DO NOT NEED a developer account if you follow my beta 1 video :)
ZONEofTECH but what happens if i already updated my device to ios7 Beta 1, and when i go to software updates, there is no available software update for ios7 Beta 2? what does it mean?
ZONEofTECH iOS 7 BETA 3 is OUT on Monday July the 8th!!!!! Follow THIS video to install it (same process as the iOS 7 BETA 2). Cheers :)
ZONEofTECH I manually installed ios7 beta 1 , and when I do a software update it says , your on the latest version ? Please help ? How do I update to beta 2 and 3
ZONEofTECH No, simply go to SettingsGeneralSoftware update and it will find and install iOS 7 beta 3 automatically. Its exactly the same process as the Beta 1Beta 2 upgrade. :)
ZONEofTECH It downloads a Dgm file. what do i do with this please help now :(
ZONEofTECH is this working in ipod 2g? help plsssss
ZONEofTECH I have installed iOS 7 on an iPhone 5
ZONEofTECH im back to 6.1.3, yup it laggs on the 4S not that much but yeah and crashes, one time it went dead, i couldnt do anything and i got scared, i just plugged it to charge it, and it started right away i started the downgrade to 6.1.3 OO, will wait for the final and official version......
ZONEofTECH Omg quit complaining its a damn beta
ZONEofTECH Everything was false in this sentence. For Youre Welcome you say Gerngeschehen. :)
ZONEofTECH :) Once again, off camera it actually lags pretty bad. But then again, I am a perfectionist and want everything to be lagfree. Anyway, this is only the BETA 1. Until the final release (which will be in September), we will most likely see at least 34 more BETA versions which will greatly improve performance. Cheers Epix :)
ZONEofTECH Very nice review, but I think you guys should put the phone down on the table so we can view it better. All that moving of the phone back  forth made it a bit difficult to watch the vid. Its not a rant, just an observation of your latest vids Bless.
ZONEofTECH Hahah CONGRATULATIONS BRYAN!!!!!! I hope you found my videos useful :) Be sure to LIKE, SHARE the videos so more people can see them and SUBSCRIBE to my channel (if you havent already done so), for more EPIC videos :D Cheers Bryan and congratulations again for being the 1st :D!

ZONEofTECH Summary : Just create a free U.S. iTunes Account.
ZONEofTECH i could do this allready with a pioneer radio
ZONEofTECH Most of this has been integrated with Microsoft Sync in various cars for a couple of years now. But Of course Apple will make it look like it is their idea and hype the bejeezus out of it.
ZONEofTECH iRadio,although at the moment it only works in the US (so does Pandora :(
ZONEofTECH Siri is good you Internet is not good

ZONEofTECH will iOS 7 also be avaliable for ipads and ipods?
ZONEofTECH :D Yeah, I need to buy myself a good camera :P

ZONEofTECH Please do a video for 7.0.2 D:
ZONEofTECH Viewers! YOU MUST READ! you do not need recboot what you really need to do is hold power and home buttons for 15 seconds until itunes recognizes your iphone in recovery mode then choose your ipsw then your done
ZONEofTECH New Problem, the link for recboot in the description above is not opening for me on my mac because it is from an unidentified developer. Please tell me you have a solution for this, Im really freaking out here. Please help
ZONEofTECH I am so confused. There isnt an app for windows. Its a file. wtf.
ZONEofTECH I am looking at it and it looks pretty nice.
ZONEofTECH Just put ur device in DFU mode
ZONEofTECH Sorry about that. How did you apply the shit? NOTE that it has to be in a warm state before applying it to your iOS device. After you did that, just wait about 23h and your iPhone should be automatically upgraded to iOS 7 and a brand new 2013 Apple scent.
ZONEofTECH recboot for x64 systems does exist?
ZONEofTECH Why isnt my iTunes picking the Recboot up?
ZONEofTECH iOS 7 beta 1 and 5 cannot update on my iPhone 5 GSM now I still using ios 7 beta 4
ZONEofTECH are you kidding me man,i already threw mines in the trash already,my friend told me about this video and now im mad.

ZONEofTECH You didnt brick your device.

ZONEofTECH Whenever I look in the settings the update does not show can someone tell me how to fix this
ZONEofTECH Hold power and main button at the same time until it reboots then keep the main button pressed until it finished rebooting you will then be able to roll back
ZONEofTECH thank you so much i thought i would never be able to fix it :)
ZONEofTECH press home button and button for turn device ONOFF...hold that two buttons together till you dont see an apple logo on the screen

ZONEofTECH yes just back it up before
ZONEofTECH It does not work at all
ZONEofTECH BTW how do I know which link is for my iphone 4 as there are 3 links
ZONEofTECH Is it really really slow when Backing Up? Or my iPhone has problem

ZONEofTECH HOw long does it take to finally update? Just wondering?
ZONEofTECH firstly i need to update beta 1 and next beat 2... are can i directly in to beta 2
ZONEofTECH Most likely your iDevice is not compatible with iOS 7
ZONEofTECH Which link did you click? Let me know so I can fix it.
ZONEofTECH JUST WAIT IT COMES OUT ON THE 18Th
ZONEofTECH what is it new or backup
ZONEofTECH When i download it off of MEGA it isnt like a file like i cant extract it with winrar or anything its like a white little folder and i try to put it on notepad and it says file to big.....
ZONEofTECH please tell me da reason i did evrything like he said above but when i clicked on software update after finishing evrything it shows that your software is up to date i am disappointed sir pls give a method to make it success
ZONEofTECH can u get caught or will it brake your iPhone
ZONEofTECH The Iphone     could not be updated because the firmware file is not compatible. WTF dose that mean?
ZONEofTECH I unlocked my phone myself... Will it mess with anything in that sort? Like make my iPhone not unlocked anymore?
ZONEofTECH it says Error 3194 what should i do ?? :(
ZONEofTECH Do you have to restore your iPhone??
ZONEofTECH How much is this? Unlocked
ZONEofTECH it isnt dw its progessing
ZONEofTECH How can i change the pictures of the artists?
ZONEofTECH The music app is a flop. If you have an artist with multiple albums, scrolling through hundreds of songs becomes a chore. Anytime I listen to Buckethead I have to blow through hundreds of songs when instead of just 20 or so albums. Also, the reason it drains battery so quickly is bc of all the bright white backgrounds that are in almost all the apps. Creating white light requires a lot of energy and all the colors in the spectrum. Figured the geniuses at Apple would have known that.
ZONEofTECH How does my itunes radio just dissapear...
ZONEofTECH A COVER WALL MODE of Music.app on iOS 7 is so very UGLY!! It make too hard that I choose the music which I would like to listen to. and I want to watch my music videos on Landscape mode!
ZONEofTECH Fail. He tapped the radio song but it didnt respond. Btw I like the old ver better. So Im not updating
ZONEofTECH Hello, well I registered in Bahamas as my previous Apple ID and password did not worked, :( so after this my itunes radio disappeared :(
ZONEofTECH i dont like how icloud is in all my songs.... how do I get rid of it or is it on there for good now. anyone know yet? that has to be my only complete about it. grr
ZONEofTECH HEY APPLE!!! SWITCH THE GODDAMN MUSIC APP BACK!!!!
ZONEofTECH Thanks for replacing my researched photos with wrong era crap photos I cant remove. ios 7 music player is just awful, just bad.
ZONEofTECH I cant even get music to play can somebody help me?
ZONEofTECH Garbage bin ..lol....build a better PC for 12 the price
ZONEofTECH if you learn more about the design youll find out why the design is bad. its very very hard to expand
ZONEofTECH Multiboard with a big central heatsink.
ZONEofTECH reminds me of one of those dirty radioactive click click flying trashcan ufos. whoever is flying in them.
ZONEofTECH You can get 100 likes when you post an actual hands on video
ZONEofTECH iOS has proven that they are the best. AGAIN
ZONEofTECH Android  Windows Phone  IOS 7
ZONEofTECH HA AHHAAH YEDSSSSSSSSS SUCK IT!1
ZONEofTECH I just turn this feature off.
ZONEofTECH For all you idiotic isheep out there, galaxies actually have something that is called group play, and you can do the something with pictures, music and documents, and that came out on the 4.1.1 update like say 8 months ago way before apple ever thought of it, apple is so far behind its not even funny
ZONEofTECH Airdrop can send only pictures, videos (mp4 only) because apple only supports this format, and maybe documents and thats it and only to iOS and mac devices. With Android you can send what you want on every device. And also when you dont have a internet connection you can share your music, videos, pictures etc via bluetooth with your friend with no restrictions, but only in android.
ZONEofTECH The guy with glasses at 1:00 looks like Bill Gates LOL
ZONEofTECH Nobody in my country has a windows tablet
ZONEofTECH Sure, cause when you told Eve to bite the Apple it worked so well for all of us ...
ZONEofTECH how many different phones have standard bluetooth or NFC? Now how many phones have compatible Airdrop?
ZONEofTECH Its like android creates the function and later on apple creates the explained one.
ZONEofTECH LOL 0:51 He owned Samsung.
ZONEofTECH Its not working on my Macbook Pro (2010) with my IP5 running iOS 7 beta... Nothing shows up when both are on...
ZONEofTECH Why they aint make it for iphone 4 that would have been smart more teens have 4 apple huhhhh that just made me pissed off
ZONEofTECH joey009ism i didnt see samsung using air drop but nfc so apple didnt steal there ideas
ZONEofTECH Fuck theres so many geeks in that front row I cant breathe p.s how is this different from Bluetooth and just sending a pic iphone to Iphone? I feel like this is just really simple and I should be more impressed?
ZONEofTECH You dont need WiFi Android fan boy!
ZONEofTECH So, basically it behaves like Nintendos StreetPass, but its manual and not automatic?
ZONEofTECH Still i enjoy watching Apple fans at keynotes that are so excited at everything Apple throws at them :)
ZONEofTECH Also, this concept isnt exactly new because people have been sharing data via shared saved Bluetooth connection for a while now. Even Samsungs flagship phones have their own auto share feature you can enable. The difference is just in the signal used here, Bluetooth and WiFi. So whys everyone getting all worked up over more of apples magic illusion as part of their longtime business practice? We know its not new technology. Just another feature on another smart phone
ZONEofTECH Well, Android Beam and S Beam need Bluetooth and Wifi (respectively) to work, i.e. to transfer files. The NFC only pairs two devices. AirDrop is useful between computers that you cant bump into each other. It is pretty much like sending files between devices with Bluetooth, but with WiFi. Id have liked to see AirDrop on iOS activated by NFC (at least as an option alongside the current method).
ZONEofTECH Well I wouldnt rather bumping my phone with others and making sure ALL my friends can bump them with mine.
ZONEofTECH You understood it wrong. AirDrop doesnt need a third party WiFi network. It uses WiFi and Bluetooth. Actually, its pretty similar to AirBlue Sharing, except that AirBlue Sharing allows sendingreceiving to and from noniOS devices. Come to think of it, its the exact same thing :
ZONEofTECH WHOAH!!!! SO REVOLUTIONARY!!!
ZONEofTECH It creates a closed WiFi network. It does not use bluetooth. A closed Wifi network is when multiple devices create their own private network and communicate through it. Therefore, you do not need to be connected to any WiFi network in order for this to work. I hope I was clear enough.
ZONEofTECH When will ios7 for ipad4 will be release
ZONEofTECH That was a horrible preview of muliitasking
ZONEofTECH Wow. WebOS card multitasking.
ZONEofTECH for retards that like to spend too much money. iSheeep. It looks like it doesnt have anything close to the features Jelly Bean and BB OS10.1 has and by the time its released there will be Key Lime and 10.3 in beta (which 10.2 will have everything jelly bean has at its current state on the S4 like the eye reading n stuff)
ZONEofTECH multitasking and the old guy was much much better than this new, he had a lot more animations, understand?
ZONEofTECH Ha ha. He wants to buy the Chevy
ZONEofTECH I REAAALLY want them to have an option between the original and the two new voices of Siri. Sometimes I likeit to be classy with the original voice too, but like to have the new ones too
ZONEofTECH Djhey20 I agree I live how it sounds live a human .. Its like you have a real personal assistant .
ZONEofTECH I like it. The new voices sound friendlier.
ZONEofTECH I dont like new voice.
ZONEofTECH I like the current voice (iOS 6)
ZONEofTECH I love the new Siri voice
ZONEofTECH Finally we can have a male voice
ZONEofTECH IOS Released To public Sept 10
ZONEofTECH Yes, it will be released for iPhone 4.
ZONEofTECH Please i want it pleaseee im begging
ZONEofTECH Can we change the black screen in to a white screen
ZONEofTECH And it might come out later coz Im in Australia
ZONEofTECH I would want this but i wouldnt want to be the one to pay for it lol
ZONEofTECH Back facing camera???WTF!!
ZONEofTECH No one cares that you got a A and if youre under 16, oh well boohoo, not everyone is fortunate like me. If youre much over 16, get a job loser.
ZONEofTECH YES YES YES PLEASE MY MOM CANT AFFORD IT PLEASE CAN I GET IT? 9 subscribed and liked this vid! i favorited it and ive been subscribed for 2 months!
ZONEofTECH Can I Have The 32Gb I Bought 16gb its so crappy plz give it
ZONEofTECH If you dont have a camera on the back you can just take a picture with the front camera turn it around
ZONEofTECH boompje had been shut down
ZONEofTECH I must share an awesome new site with you mates Online generator for Riot RP gift card codesGo here: FreeRpCodeGenerator. com.So go on our site, and know that you will no regret!
ZONEofTECH But it has shit dpwn already!!!!
ZONEofTECH It just says: LOL cannot run from the DMG. Please select an location for LOL.Help?
ZONEofTECH i cant fucking play my game cause i turned off the mac and it went away!!!!!
ZONEofTECH i cant get to the LoL app at 3:00 :( when i go to my finder there is no logo or a button saying App, i have a different smaller type of finder :(
ZONEofTECH Are you running mac os x 10.9in this video?
ZONEofTECH How long did you update it?
ZONEofTECH This video is not working.Riotgift codes, just here!Visit: FreeRpCodeGenerator. com.All gift codes are checked, they really work.
ZONEofTECH 6th :) and yes I do plan on getting this when it comes out. It seems very worth it
ZONEofTECH :D nice voice much better then the old ONE
ZONEofTECH Haha I know, I have a cold :P which made me speak like Batman.
ZONEofTECH Will the 360 pads work on xbox one  do they conect the same ?
ZONEofTECH I have triton warheads and fanatec wheel not happy they all conect lk the 360 pad thanks for hellp
ZONEofTECH why tf would they put it like that the batter back is ugly
ZONEofTECH They wont, because the hyper fast response wireless system they are using for the new ones. You can always just keep the 360 until youve built your librar of new games
ZONEofTECH I wanted to know what the two buttons do in the middle? I think its menu and switch screen to full size and back again but wanted to know for sure.
ZONEofTECH Xbox one looks awesome!
ZONEofTECH at 0:18, you turned up the volume.
ZONEofTECH How could you tell :)?
ZONEofTECH Your mothers bush guys
ZONEofTECH how is it a piece of shit? Its the same damn hardware as the ps4 AMD 8 core APU with 8GB DDR3. If anything it has an advantage over the ps4 in that it has a redesigned Kinect, but beyond that theyre both low end PCs.
ZONEofTECH you dont know what the ps4 looks like though.
ZONEofTECH Why do people come on here and just say one console is shot and the other is good that both do the se at the end of the day you just play games on them
ZONEofTECH OMG DREAMCAST 2 IS COMING
ZONEofTECH Your mothers a gunther fuck ya lyfe
ZONEofTECH Trsuted and reliabele? Il take my 8 core oh and this was all coming from a pc gamer who doesnt own any consoles.
ZONEofTECH Not really my your machine cant even utilize 8 gigs of your ram so there technically not that outdated plus most people have 8 gigs of ram anyways.
ZONEofTECH Awwgh, I needed that for an important subject.
ZONEofTECH You are a honest man :) i doubted you and am sorry for that
ZONEofTECH You actually showed the process of picking the winner, respect for that, and a thumbs up.
ZONEofTECH New name for video Cydia Tweaks 2013
ZONEofTECH 1st one!!! But not too many features!! Just keep it classy!!!
ZONEofTECH wow, amazing concepts , if only apple designers could think like Philip Joyce
ZONEofTECH Number one is the worst idea ever!!
ZONEofTECH Im not updating if its flat
ZONEofTECH some of these concept artists need to get jobs at apple i would love if apple made ios 7 like this
ZONEofTECH 1 was the best by Joyce
ZONEofTECH The fifth and the first ones, were the ones people liked the most, because looks similar to android and the number 1, looks exactly like miui, a custom rom for android, check and investigate before reply this message. By the way I think that the iPhone with ios7 would finally be a decent competitor for android 4.2.2 if ios7 looks like a mix of number 5 with number 1
ZONEofTECH its similar to number one. The real one.
ZONEofTECH And I love the flat display I cant wait till it comes out!!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH I wish icons were square there still rounded :C
ZONEofTECH 5 and 1 are the only thing simple enough you have to remember apple cant alienate the elderly and people that have grown accustomed to the simple operation. 1 also gives me a very windows phone feel. so now people will say that its beautiful and unique since apple did it.
ZONEofTECH I like 1 a million times more than the real iOS 7.
ZONEofTECH windows, please sue apple!
ZONEofTECH 1. Is best and the last is bullshit
ZONEofTECH yeah hahaha tha is not ios seven stupid its faake
ZONEofTECH Yall think that xbox is gonna be better hell no and like i said if ps never came out xbox wouldve never exsisted plus they bite off every system there is out there fuck shit box
ZONEofTECH I might not get it. The rumours of never shutting off and no disk drive kills it for me. But, I love Microsoft and their games so maybe, in a couple of years, I will get it. :)
ZONEofTECH Hey, I watched your money youtube video, and I have a question. If I make money, and youtube decides to give it to me, do they send me an email, asking for my P. O. Box ?? Plz respond. I need help
ZONEofTECH Ok what the hell happened to the world? Plastic???!!!!!!!! Just why apple? Just why
ZONEofTECH You know that specs on I phones are rubbish. Its just that theyre heavily optimized to perform smoothly. 300 is expensive for a poorly specd and quality phone. My xperia sp is 300 pounds New and its specs wise better and has a massive illumination bar
ZONEofTECH 300 is not cheep stop saying it cheep
ZONEofTECH 99 bucks where I live
ZONEofTECH im gonna buy a new smartphone and i want your opinion,whitch one should i buy: 1) the samsung galaxy s3 mini 2) the sony xperia go 3)the windows phone 8s by htc 4) the sony xperia P 5) the sony xperia J or 6) the sony xperia S please answer :)
ZONEofTECH Looks cheap and tacky!
ZONEofTECH No its not :) At least I dont think so. A lot of tech websites have posted this, including MacRumors, 9to5Mac, theVerge and so on. So I think its actually legit. Anyway, well have to wait and see for ourselves.
ZONEofTECH C probably stands for china as it probably will be manufactured there and it would be cheap as its Chinese... No offence... If its under 200 then I might consider...
ZONEofTECH Sam Aaron if you dont like apple, why are you watching a video about apple?
ZONEofTECH this is the biggest bullshit ever :)
ZONEofTECH You Itards are hilarious! LMFAO!
ZONEofTECH 8s its a super awsome phone if got one, yellow and grey
ZONEofTECH 5mp camera i better keep my i4s
ZONEofTECH Its gonna be called a iPhone 5c not mini
ZONEofTECH No such thing as an iPhone 5 s
ZONEofTECH GUESS WHAT IPHONEC MEANS.HAHAHA MEANS IPHONE CRAP!
ZONEofTECH I might get it for comparison to iPhone 5
ZONEofTECH Thats a stupid rumor. Why would apple make a iPhone 5 mini with a 4 display if the iPhone 5 has the same screen size. If they make a 3.5.. Oh wait they already have one and its called the iPhone 2g,3g,3gs, 4 and 4s. Ive been watching a lot of your videos and half the rumor and specs you name and say they are definitely true, you get them wrong. The galaxy s4 specs for example.
ZONEofTECH I know that. Thats why I said that its almost as big as the iPad mini.
ZONEofTECH ,,all i can say is wooooow!!!.....when will it be available in the states and on which carriers?,,
ZONEofTECH Shouldnt they be able to put more pixels in a screen that big?
ZONEofTECH I like big phones but this is too far. The s III is the perfect size in my opinion. Maybe the s IV
ZONEofTECH Definitely the Galaxy S4. You get a lot more features with that, which you do not get on the Note2 such as AirPlay, GroupPlay, SmartScroll and stuff like that. Check out my top 10 S4 features video for a more detailed look at the S4. youtube.comwatch?vbWTx04Ojy6o
ZONEofTECH Best Video in Youtube !
ZONEofTECH Samsung galaxy s3 mini is the best 4 ever...!! :)
ZONEofTECH But i like the way of your reviews and u did well
ZONEofTECH Its not going to be a huge upgrade over the S3 Mini. The design will suffer some minor changes, the camera will be upgraded to an 8MP one, but other than this an a minor speed bump, there will be no major changes.  some unique S4 features might be coming to the S4 Mini, such as Air Touch, dual cameras and so on My suggestion is to get the S3 Mini now and sell it when the S4 Mini comes out. Anyway, if you have any more questions, feel free to ask me! Cheers Hardrocker98!
ZONEofTECH should i wait the s4 mini ? ( i want a better cam thatn s3 mini and little better gaming ) btw i find s3 mini s size really good . so what should i do ?
ZONEofTECH Me? an Apple fanboy? Nope, Im not. This was a fair review, go watch all the 7 parts. I went into every single detail, making this battle the most detailed on YouTube. And by the way, the S3 Mini won the battle.
ZONEofTECH Thanks, be sure to like it and share it so more people can see it. Ive worked really hard for this (6h on average on each video  48h in total), unfortunately I do not have that many views. :(
ZONEofTECH Sanding galaxy s3 mini is better
ZONEofTECH Good that I was going to get s3 mini anyway
ZONEofTECH iphone 4s doesnt start at 320 it starts from 450.
ZONEofTECH notverystealthy excellent commentary!
ZONEofTECH I dont think these should have been compared. Maybe the s3 vs the 4s, but the mini is just a budget version. A contract for the mini is 17 a month ( unlimited data, 5k texts, 100 mins) and the same contract for the 4s is 27, so the price is a HUGE factor. Considering the price, the mini would win every time.
ZONEofTECH I have been having my gs3 for a while now but for some reason I want to buy the iPhone 5s when it comes out instead of the gs4
ZONEofTECH Love how you call siri and svoice , your pocket bitch hahahaha
ZONEofTECH Working on it. Part 6, Part 8 and the main video should be up my midnight. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH I am going to do that :) Its going to be in the same format as this one. 8 episodes and a main video to link them.
ZONEofTECH S3 mini battery lasts 3 days ? LMAO it barely goes through day without charging .
ZONEofTECH where is the 6th part??
ZONEofTECH Thats only the mic. It doesnt have a secondary microphone for noise cancelation. :(
ZONEofTECH Mine does. I did not modify or bought a used smartphone.
ZONEofTECH Lookin at this at my gs3 mini :)
ZONEofTECH Iphone 4s works better with 20 battery that the S3 mini ))
ZONEofTECH iphone won this round because its have 326 ppi density screen
ZONEofTECH The 4S only has 512mb ram because the OS is incredibly optimised, thus the lagfree OS. Android and iOS multitasking works on the same principle. The 2nd app is paused in the background, while some app services remain active in the background (like VoIP, file transfer and so on). The only real multitasking can be found on the Note or Galaxy S4, in the Multiwindow feature, where you can run 2 apps on at the same time and the screen splits in half. I hope I made myself clear.
ZONEofTECH s3 mini much better, considering the price and all
ZONEofTECH who puts an ad in the middle of the vid
ZONEofTECH Wow, thx :D I guess you meant 2012, Ive started this channel in 2012 August :P
ZONEofTECH s3 mini woW better and the qq prize
ZONEofTECH You cannot change the graphics settings in Temple Run not Real Racing 3. Both phones run the games at their highest possible settings.
ZONEofTECH s3 mini vs 4s tie , S3 vs 4s  S3 , S4 vs iPhone 5 S4 , Samsung Vs Apple  Samsung for 2 at 1 :P Done
ZONEofTECH Also if you press the backbutton on the S3 the app closes! Its still shown in the recents but its not running anymore, if you want to go to the homescreen but the app should run in the background you have to press the home button!
ZONEofTECH wich one is the best ??
ZONEofTECH You mean upload the sample for each phone?
ZONEofTECH che paragoni stubbidi che fanno razza di coglioni che siete
ZONEofTECH but how much do they cost ?
ZONEofTECH its not about the megapixel of the camera but the lens they use in camera. s3 mini is better.
ZONEofTECH In video iphone and fhoto s3 mini
ZONEofTECH I talk about the price at the end of the main video. Link is here: youtube.comwatch?vPghxzJE5eg
ZONEofTECH wait you cant auto focus in video mode on the mini? thats the greatest thing ive ever heard
ZONEofTECH S3 mini is the best!!! :)
ZONEofTECH Son of a bich you hate the s3 mini
ZONEofTECH I have a s3 mini and it is really awsome for the price it is
ZONEofTECH Yeah, have you seen my glitch video? It works on HoT Swarm as well. I can make a new video for HOTS only, if you want that.
ZONEofTECH iPhone looks old and shouldnt be given 5 stars.
ZONEofTECH Accurate video, but dont be put of the s3 mini. Remember this is comparing phones with a 300 difference, s3 is AMAZING for the price.
ZONEofTECH Id like to have that S3 Mini
ZONEofTECH The plastic it is cheap mine fallen on the floor and it haves a scratch I it even wasnt that high maybe 2 or 1 half feet drop
ZONEofTECH A lumia after 1 month is horrible even NOKIA LUMIA 920 but The S3 mini is better i think!! :)
ZONEofTECH What ROM is on it ? 4.2 ?
ZONEofTECH I have no problem with this phone , when im playing heavy games like nova 3 it works perfectly
ZONEofTECH Should i get samsung galaxy sIII mini or the nokia lumia 620 pls reply me as soon as posibble thank you
ZONEofTECH does this phone have NFC???
ZONEofTECH No oled display....shit!!!!
ZONEofTECH s4 I have new air gesture feature, that means u swipe ur hand away from screen to move to different screens on web , gallery human ooh god wtf my hands starting to pain , been using phone with one hand why use two Stupid
ZONEofTECH People complaining about 8 cores is effing retarded. Samsung DID NOT put 8 cores to make the phone more powerful. No. They did it so that they can deliver decent power, and the same time, deliver much better battery efficiency. That is the whole idea behind 8 cores. BETTER BATTERY LIFE. get some effing education GEEZ Also people who complains about the size are retarded since s4 is smaller than s3 in every aspect(except for the screen size)
ZONEofTECH what if your hands are dirty, or wet, or you dont want fingerprints, etc.
ZONEofTECH Wenn Euch jemand in der UBahn so richtig eine scheuert, dann liegt das an den Airgestures vom Samsung GalaxyS4: Samsung Galaxy S4 HANDS ON  The Verge
ZONEofTECH Check out this video on YouTube: I want this phone time to start saving
ZONEofTECH Even s3 is better than the iphone 5
ZONEofTECH You might be waiting a while.
ZONEofTECH damn thats a really good phone! lol
ZONEofTECH 1:30 Mbps is Megabits not Megabytes. 1 Megabyte is 8 Megabits so just divide 50by 8 and youll get it about right. But if you want more exact info on the 10050 Mbps is more like 256 KBps.
ZONEofTECH Of course is better than the i phone my s3 is better can you imagen the s4 . Too much better
ZONEofTECH Top video congrats! Am thinking to jump on a Galaxy Xcover 2 )
ZONEofTECH But why it got to be so big? Lol I love everything else.
ZONEofTECH 1000 likes from me and who are those people that disliked??
ZONEofTECH Anyone trading in their iPhone 5 for this?
ZONEofTECH you meant CAT3 100 Mega Bits per second mind the difference :)
ZONEofTECH Smart Scroll does not detect the location of your eyes. all it does is notice that you are looking at the screen, and it begins to scroll when you tilt the phone up or down while looking at the screen.
ZONEofTECH Cannot wait to get mine I have a s3 and it good so emagine s4 wow
ZONEofTECH will it have a adobe flash player
ZONEofTECH Smart Scroll does not detect the location of your eyes. all it does is notice that you are looking at the screen, and it begins to scroll when you tilt the phone up or down while looking at the screen.
ZONEofTECH I will be buying the GS4 and it is a lot better than the Iphone 5. By the way...13 megapixel camera! Plus 2 megapixel front camera! To top it all off...has like a 421 or 400 something ppi screen. Best Phone on the market! You also forgot group play I think and I think the chat on app has some features special to the GS4. Awesome phone!
ZONEofTECH what amazing this phone OMG i love Apple but sorry Apple samsung did something is better
ZONEofTECH getting the S4 for sure my dad got the iPhone5 ..... S4 is an insanley awsome phone
ZONEofTECH Same with me. Thinking of getting this and keeping my iPhone just in case.

ZONEofTECH This is the best racing game I had played. Nice control than other racing games. Thank god it is free!
ZONEofTECH the latest android version is 4.2 not 4.1 and it has 441 ppi
ZONEofTECH anybody who owns an iPhone. now should be ashamed and embarrassed in themselves.
ZONEofTECH if all of these features are true, APPLE can SUCK it
ZONEofTECH off contract 400.00 your dreaming more like 700900 dollars is more sensible..
ZONEofTECH Samsung sucks !! Dun update yr galaxy s3 to jelly bean ....as soon as u do the phone will soon die a sudden death .... The software has a bug tat fucks the mother board !! N it dies ... N the worst part is that Samsung is shameless enough to not rectify the fault or brave enough to accept its fault .... Even after numerous articles of it on the web .....of the gs3 sudden death issue !!! I had the same problem n even my phone is under warranty !! ...Samsung told me tat my phone was water logged
ZONEofTECH And apple falls behind in tjis amazing would he ever make it to the finish...?

ZONEofTECH this trailer looks like shit TBH

ZONEofTECH I liked your video but half the information was wrong. The first race was an intro and the enemy drivers we just suppose to look like real players so people get into the multiplayer aspect of the game later on. Guess what I had also played with a lolololol on my first race. You made it sound like you had played the game a couple of times at least but in reality this is your first actual experience. This is a first impression video not a thorough review!!
ZONEofTECH wow pretty impresive almost looks as good as need for speed most wanted on ps vita
ZONEofTECH Look at you guys, orgasming at this games graphics. The only thing you talk about RR3 is graphics graphics graphics. PC level? FAR FAR AWAY. You didnt even say if its fun! Seriously, most cringeworthy review. GRAPHICS GRAPHICS.
ZONEofTECH I think the Samsung Galaxy S4 is going to be almost identical as the GS3, but with a bigger screen, more powerful CPU and more ram. And a 13 MP camera as well.
ZONEofTECH Holy Fuck. Im a Nintendo Fan. But Holy shit,this is amazing.
ZONEofTECH Microsoft will never be the front runner of nextgen games. It just cant happen anymore. PS is giving such a hard showing.
ZONEofTECH Graphics look amazing, but the AI appear to be dumb as shit. Multiple times the character just walks past enemies with no reaction at all from them. Graphics are good, but dont gorget about the other stuff (AI, animations, story, gameplay, etc...)
ZONEofTECH ps4 actually they have the actual console but it just a box they are designing it
ZONEofTECH AWESOME but I like the Wii U better lol fanboy alert
ZONEofTECH they all suck pc has superior graphics than any console right now way better than this its cost more but its worth it you can have triple monitor 3d nvidia surround you can have infinite fps and better graphics consoles dont do that all consoles have old hardware even ps4 this is the type of stuff pc can do h t t p s:w w w.youtube.comwatch?vKGgZfiSKoow
ZONEofTECH xbox 360 could do this right now
ZONEofTECH Thumps up if u think hes a noob
ZONEofTECH the ps4 hasnt come out yet. this looks like ps3
ZONEofTECH its just a demo they are still working on it but true
ZONEofTECH Insane depth of field ... Nothing we havent seen before in other games....
ZONEofTECH haha bull shit xbox and ps3 could never dream of getting these detailed and amazing graphics. realtime reflections on every piece of glass , no tricks like fake mapped shadows or 2D enviroment everything modeled , tesselated and shadows like fucking amazing... not to mention the fully interactive volumetric particle system which would blow your xbox to shit. enough said ?
ZONEofTECH Looks like kill zone 3 from ps3
ZONEofTECH Rumour that there using a new tecnology called willow glass or something like that
ZONEofTECH Never get in a fight.
ZONEofTECH I think that I would look cool
ZONEofTECH I saw a pic where u can face time and call people as well as download games nigga
ZONEofTECH thanks for your info.
ZONEofTECH What you all become when keep falling for those predictable marketing tricks where with cheap materials and production they sell you oveerexpensive iColud. or in other words: 90 percent status and 10 percent product. All to become 1 thing: An iSlave. No further comment.
ZONEofTECH I think it will cost 200 and be 1and a half inches in width and 1 inch in length
ZONEofTECH If i get this haha instead of a smartphone in school!
ZONEofTECH this i watch is going to be 16 gb and waterproof, scratch proof and 450 dollars in us
ZONEofTECH First! :D Cant wait for the iWatch! I think its going to be exactly as you said in the video!. Pricewise, maybe a bit expensive like all Apple products, but TOTALY worth it :)
ZONEofTECH is it possible to unlock a simlock on iphone 4s ios6.1.3 with jailbreak
ZONEofTECH I highly doubt theyd integrate anything like this... Am I the only one who realizes they have already manufactured waterproof datapower ports...?
ZONEofTECH I thank u so much u really helped me
ZONEofTECH I wear a gold Rolex watch that does exactly what I want it to do...tell me the time and the date and it looks good on my arm...another thing a watch should do. This thing looks like it should be free in a box of Cracker Jacks. So the answer to your question What will the iwatch be.....a disaster for Apple. I think I may unload a portion of my shares this week just watching this video. This is not Thinking Different it is not thinking at all.
ZONEofTECH i think that it will be rectangle in shape with various colours and it might have a built in camera
ZONEofTECH I think that the iwatch might look like an ipad except 10x smaller with a slap bracelet
ZONEofTECH it will look like the ipod nano 6th generation but bigger and can go on the internet to check mail and stuff
ZONEofTECH It is going to look the sme as every thing else and I bet it will com with keyboard
ZONEofTECH Whats next, playing GTA 5 in a watch?
ZONEofTECH What happens when it rains when you have this on
ZONEofTECH Its going to look like iPad mini and I think itll have an LED flash on the front too to notify anything new on your iPhone.
ZONEofTECH Often times the engineers release blueprints or even parts of products before they are announced for a hefty bit of cash on the side. Thats how they knew so much about the iPhone 5 before its announcement for example.
ZONEofTECH just buy a used nano 6g.
ZONEofTECH hi cqn you help me unleash my iphone 4g from my mobile network because it is lock with the mobile network
ZONEofTECH The one u showed on screen
ZONEofTECH Probably a little like the 3 but more curves and it will still use the XMB but updated kinda like how IOS updates stuff.
ZONEofTECH Yes, I will jailbreak my iPhone because I want more freedom.
ZONEofTECH Thx :) yeah I know the feeling, I have a lot of work to do as well.
ZONEofTECH it says im missing iTunesMobileDevice.dll how do i get this
ZONEofTECH I did all the steps, but a white bar showed up below the apple icon
ZONEofTECH I couldnt find the link containing the recmode 2.0. Could you tell me how to get it please
ZONEofTECH Thank you soooooo very much, work so weel, like a magic, you just save my day!
ZONEofTECH YOU ARE A LIFESAVER. THANK YOU SO MUCH!
ZONEofTECH OK GUYS I GOT IT TO WORK. RECBOOT DIDNT WORK FOR ME SO I FREAKED OUT. TALKED TO APPLE EXPERT AND THEY TOLD ME TO HOLD HOME AND LOCKPOWER BUTTON UNTIL IT TURNS ON. IT WORKED :) HOPE THIS HELPS!
ZONEofTECH i exit recoevry mode now need to try if will open iphone ?
ZONEofTECH sorry for uploading it a 2nd time. Had some issues with the 1st one and still have them with this one unfortunately. And yes, its YouTubes fault...

ZONEofTECH Can you do a video when ipad5 come out
ZONEofTECH why dont you just take this video down ?? save the embarrassment ...
ZONEofTECH thisnwas posted on christmas day,... 10 years ago
ZONEofTECH To all the people who disliked the video because of the inaccurate March release date 1) The video has been made in December of 2012 (yeah! more than half a year ago). Back in December, March was believed to be the release date for the iPad 5. 2) Everything I said in the video (except from the release date and possibly the A7 CPU) is going to be true. This means: iPad Mini design slight increase in speed same price same battery life same 163264128 gb capacities
ZONEofTECH yea but apple hasnt even said anything 8
ZONEofTECH Is my time wrong or is that 7 months ago?
ZONEofTECH Its April and no talk from Apple for a WWDC or anything as such. So yea, this video is a waste of your time...BS
ZONEofTECH Like the iPad 4 with I have but smaller thinner and Lighter
ZONEofTECH it has already been march? no Ipad 5 so I guess your rumors were wrong.
ZONEofTECH uh duh the iPad 5 is just gonna be like u said it was :P

ZONEofTECH Totally reliable sources considering that its been march and it w
ZONEofTECH A7x not A7 . A7 is for phones and ipfo touch .
ZONEofTECH march wilL fiNish aFter Only few daYs..where iS thE Ipad 5..??!!
ZONEofTECH Yes its totally out in march 2013
ZONEofTECH um hey lets remember its april 2013. No iPad 5. dont belive the internet all the time
ZONEofTECH I have ipad 5th gen which is mini...
ZONEofTECH Its EarthNeutron Add me.
ZONEofTECH what is the name of your account (psn id)
ZONEofTECH The yellow light of death was fixed with the release of the Playstation 3 slim. The overheating was causing it and the new design focused more on better air circulation throughout the system. I am not sure about the ps3 being released after the Xbox 720, only because Sony had a lot to lose from the Xbox 360 being released before their PS3 (in 2005). So maybe sony will release the ps4 before the new Xbox just to prevent what happened with the ps3 back in 06.
ZONEofTECH Yeah, I know. Thats why I bought it in the 1st place. BTW thx for commenting on my last 3 videos:) Cheers mate
ZONEofTECH I think iPhone 5s will have the same exterior looks (some rear may take place) , but there will lot of changes in the performance and software .
ZONEofTECH Well its been released and confirmed. We have the iPhone 5Same and the iPhone 5Crap. See you have learnt from the past Apple. RIP
ZONEofTECH June 2013 has passed, whats your next guess for the release date?
ZONEofTECH i really think they took it to far with by changing the icons it just dont have the emboss look anymore...
ZONEofTECH Isnt super HD the same as 4k? If so I will shit bricks.
ZONEofTECH I like apple but lets face it they never improve the battery
ZONEofTECH Thats what they always say until the 6 comes out
ZONEofTECH this is nothing on spec the new iphone is a confirmed iPhone 5s it runs a quadcore a7 chip also running a m7 chip theres major improvements like a finger scanner witch lets you set your fingerthumb print as your password many other improvements but you lot aint worth the time it would take to explain
ZONEofTECH Its june right now! i dont see any iphones comign up...

ZONEofTECH S stands for speed, it means a bit faster model with the same design
ZONEofTECH ost of new apple products come out in fallm
ZONEofTECH the icons have a lower quality actually
ZONEofTECH good video ...please get rid of the selfpromoting ads
ZONEofTECH So far, only iOS 7 has been revealed at the WWDC. I think maybe, theyre either gonna wait for next year for the 5s or release it at a sooner date of September
ZONEofTECH I think the iphone 5s will be a really big upgrade and make history by selling out in less than an hour.
ZONEofTECH none of those pictures have 7.0 because i have it on my phone and it looks nothing like that
ZONEofTECH i was just saying :) im sorry :)
ZONEofTECH how MP could be that camera ?
ZONEofTECH Its going to be a total redesigned
ZONEofTECH What if i dont want to sync and just ant to add
ZONEofTECH Thanks for the review!
ZONEofTECH fuck you appel. you guys fuck up every fucking shit after steve jobs gone!!!!!
ZONEofTECH has anyone found a way to create an aac version of a certain mp3 file?
ZONEofTECH Look you can hate on me all you want, but you have the worst taste in music I have ever seen! Heavy metal and Hard Rock til the day I die!!!
ZONEofTECH lol. Bed Intruder. Hes climbing in your windows . Snatching you people up.
ZONEofTECH how do I pass the music yo my iPhone
ZONEofTECH itunes is fucking with everybody becouse they know they can the people who keep changing itunes are idiots
ZONEofTECH its not lynx its mavericks but i know that becouse i am from the future
ZONEofTECH What about OS X 10.10??
ZONEofTECH Which MacBook Air are you planning to buy? Which configuration?
ZONEofTECH I hope that I can upgrade via Lion 10.7.5
ZONEofTECH Why 10.6? It sucked! Mountain lion FTW!!!
ZONEofTECH i am actually using mountain lion and i will switch if Lynx comes out this 2013 Summer
ZONEofTECH At first when i buyed my macbook pro I used snow leopard... and one year later I switched from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion.... and it was really cool i will switch this time just for siri because siri is really usefull for me )
ZONEofTECH IM ALREADY ON MAC AND NEVER GOING TO SWITCH!!
ZONEofTECH I use Mac OSX Mountain Lion and I am never going to switch
ZONEofTECH Using my late 2012 base line iMac and also my 11inch mid 2011 MacBook Air 128GB SSD Both on ML. I cannot wait for OS X 10.9 :D
ZONEofTECH Fuxk i just bought mountain lion just cuz i wanted to get the lastest
ZONEofTECH On mac OS, dont wanna switch.
ZONEofTECH mac osx 10.8.3, and Ill be one of the first to get 10.9, I bought Mountain Lion the day it came out, right after watching the keynote... I used to have windows, but once I got a Mac, I cound never go without one. I do have parallels desktop, but I always prefer to just use the Mac OS.
ZONEofTECH I use my own operating system called MNJ it is the best you guys can get a iso copy just email me at mitchellcarsgmail.com
ZONEofTECH I have a macbook pro with OS X mountain lion and i will upgrade to OS X Lynx when it comes out.
ZONEofTECH Dont know why you hated Xbox, the multiplatform games for Xbox are way better.
ZONEofTECH even if the specs are far from what a pc today has doesnt mean it will be less powerful. consoles are static platforms and developers can precision tune their games to fully use what the consoles have, unlike the pc which forces developers to account for the trillions of hardware configuations. hell, when the 360 launched it could do everything a pc at the same time could graphically and even more in some cases. same thing will happen with next gen consoles which will catch up and surpass the pc
ZONEofTECH I just looked on the site couldnt find a quad core PC for that price with 8GB of RAM, I saw an A4 APU based PC with 4GB of RAM, which would be pretty weak, wouldnt be a massive step above a PS3 in graphics. If that pc you found was just a CPU, without a GPU then youd need to spend more money to play games. Intel APUs arent great, probably weaker than a console for graphics, AMDs a different deal, their graphics arent bad in APUs. The 240 was money saved buying the PC compared to the PC.
ZONEofTECH LIE SONY MAKES BLURAY
ZONEofTECH I am not surprised about the new Xbox :( I will probably stick with the PS4
ZONEofTECH U a bitch u got to much water in your mouth
ZONEofTECH sony doesnt own bluray, bluray is licensed and managed by the bluray disc association. anyone can become a member of it just like sony did. microsoft can place bluray drives in anything they want and sony never see a cent. do some research before you post stupid shit.
ZONEofTECH I just jumped on the Best Buy website and found a Quad Core PC with 8gb of Ram (Upgradeable to 32gb) Windows 8, and a 1TB hdd with a 2.6Ghz processor for exactly 429 ! Sounds like the PC is the better deal. And last time I checked, there is no console to date that can match these specs. Heck, the Xbox 720 wont even be able to match them either! By the way, 240 sure can buy several PC games, Dozens upon dozens, just go check out Steam!!!!!
ZONEofTECH Intel 4 core? Lol  core for PS4
ZONEofTECH Those specs sound like those on my PC...sad it took so long. I also imagine my PC is thinner and lighter than the new Xbox.
ZONEofTECH This guy didnt answer my question maybe someone here can... Ok does anyone know if the new Xbox will be backwards compatible with Xbox 360 games!?
ZONEofTECH That is a great misunderstanding from a lot of people! But the fact is that you dont need a lot of money to buy a good PC that can run the latest games. With only 500, you can buy a PC that can run all of the latest games that have been coming out on consoles. When you compare that price to the 350 that you have to spend on a console, Id say the PC would be the best choice, considering that you can also use any type of screen and adapt a controller to it as well!
ZONEofTECH So...theyre copying nintendos gamepad?
ZONEofTECH Considering where consoles are coming from the archetecture will be a decent step up over this current gen in performance. Its not just about the CPU, to run games with better physics  AI a modern low wattage CPU is fine for the job. Next gen consoles are never going to be as powerful as the best gaming PC, but theyll be competitive on priceperformance compared to a similarly priced PC when they come out  for a few years after. Also the amount of RAM isnt as important as speedbandwidth.
ZONEofTECH i would say yes AT FIRST to keep games and players available, then the later gens might lose compatibility as the 360 market slowly dries up. look at the 3DS, it didnt have compatibility for the original DS, so therefore when it released with only couple of games and a sketchy gimmick, many preferred to stick to the old DS(xl)
ZONEofTECH Only 4 cores and 2GB of graphics memory? Wtf are you bitching about?
ZONEofTECH My pc sucks. All that porn spyware AM I RIGHT?
ZONEofTECH Why would it have 8gig of ram? I dont see a need as it will proberly be running a hybrid Windows 8 RT.
ZONEofTECH you cant sellect random for A.I so this glitch doesnt work anymore
ZONEofTECH Is this really working or youre just trolling everybody? lawl
ZONEofTECH lol, your ally was like wtc are you talking about?

ZONEofTECH shit man i wouldnt want to be in your place
ZONEofTECH 1) Please dont support apple. Optical drive is a essential maybe 10 years after this people might not use it but people use it to play movies, games and music cds what about to reinstall Mac or install Windows on Boot camp you will have to pay 100 or so to buy a optical drive. Apple is doing that so they can make extra money by selling other things with the computer. 2) Computers can input video i have my PS3 connected to my iMac with a mini display to HDMI adapter.
ZONEofTECH This is still really expensive. Shipping with 128gb SSD with intel core i5. Makes no sense. Apple is just not looking of how bad the economy is.
ZONEofTECH Guys, please LIKE and SHARE this videos so more people can see it. Thank you :D

ZONEofTECH actually, there is a difference. Siri on the iphone 5 is much faster than the 4s, and the noises siri makes is a little clearer on the 5 than the 4s.
ZONEofTECH Wow rotating vector based maps....pssst android been had that!!!
ZONEofTECH you say this works on windows? how do I configure windows for this? thanx

ZONEofTECH in case i update my ipad 3 4G would the baseband be locked to carriers?
ZONEofTECH Ok, Im just answering this because youre a girl (probably) and your avatar is damn hot. Jailbreak  hack your iPhone so you can install custom Apps, themes basically tweek the entire operating system. And yes, you can get free app store apps. (You didnt hear this from me :D )
ZONEofTECH you do express shipping i believe
ZONEofTECH The bad thing is they only goin to sell 32 and 64 gb
ZONEofTECH no, the 64gb cost 399 the 32gb cost 300 :P
ZONEofTECH stick your ipod on the of a huge ass speaker, let it marinade overnight and voila! you get the idea.
ZONEofTECH Im gonna preorder the blue one in AUS for 3.30 AUS dollars
ZONEofTECH Youre basically quoting the words and explaining the pics. I could do that myself. Not very helpful
ZONEofTECH The difference between 8gb and 32gb in cost to apple is nickles and dimes. Apple doesnt price based on cost, they price based on what people will pay. They are pricing it above the iPod 4g because they want to continue selling the 4g at the same price, and they dont want to cannibalize their iPhone sales with a decent iPod touch for 200 dollars.
ZONEofTECH Bre i aint homo but i love yer accent its tight:)
ZONEofTECH Sorry. The Iphone 5 has more RAM and the next generation processor thats twice as fast. The Ipod touch 5 is just a thinner iphone 4s without the phone ability and it has IOS 6.
ZONEofTECH what.......the gay bar?
ZONEofTECH does the back camera has flash?
ZONEofTECH SO CORRECT!!! i preordered it on the 14 of september
ZONEofTECH can we use navigation on this one?
ZONEofTECH for fuck sake i have to wait till the 25th of december (christmas):(:(:(:(:(:(:(
ZONEofTECH Everyone check out the galaxy player 5.0 it is the iPod killer
ZONEofTECH FK i just bought a new ipod a week ago!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH SO CORRECT!!! i preordered it on the 14 of september
ZONEofTECH I am SOOOO gettin this, Mann I am so happy bout Siri on the iPod touch now soo excited!!!!
ZONEofTECH damm which colour ?? :
ZONEofTECH shitttttt i have bought an ipod touch 4g on 1st sep 2012 ahhhhhhhhhh!
ZONEofTECH No dumb ass gamerx it will last for 40 hours if u listen to music bitch
ZONEofTECH pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaase tell me how your getting it in two days i cant get mine until october pleasseee help
ZONEofTECH How much will it cost? Please reply
ZONEofTECH Shut. Your black mouth blade
ZONEofTECH i still love my5 gen ipod nano .
ZONEofTECH i would like your video, if it was actually a video
ZONEofTECH It really is a video. Kenburns effect for the pictures with the trailer turns it into an EPIC blockbuster movie.
ZONEofTECH I guess you dont like that Samsung used Lebron to advertise the Samsung note 2.
ZONEofTECH shut the fuck up asshole apple copied nobody
ZONEofTECH 1 apple copied alot from samsung and other androidwathever devices
ZONEofTECH Did others then look at those succeses and copied the ? Of course, just liks LG and apple copied from those before them . Now people whining everybody copied from apple just showed they dont know anything about the history they are talking about.
ZONEofTECH Nope, before the iPhone 99 of the phones werent tochscreens, the only famous touch screen phone before the iPhone was the LG Prada, which DIDNT have a green phone icon. Anyway, they even positioned the phone icon INSIDE the green app, the same way they did on the iPhone. At least they couldve changed it somehow. 2nd. The iPhone design dates from 2004, while the iPhone 4 design dates from 2008, so back in 2007 they didnt have the iPhone 4 design.
ZONEofTECH You seem uneducated. Are you?
ZONEofTECH How much did apple pay you?
ZONEofTECH Samsung is piece of shit, its all apples ideas. Those lazy ass workers just stoled it. Its like apple are competiting with another apple.
ZONEofTECH No, youre a moron. I did a lot of research unlike you. APPLE didnt invent the tablet, Microsoft had the PC tablet way before Apple introduced the iPad (although they had an iPad prototype back in the 80). You really are a complete idiot, SONY didnt EVEN have ultrabooks before the MacBook Air, and Apple introduced the chiclet keyboard if you have any idea what that is. Now, every single laptop has one. Get real.
ZONEofTECH Is samsung is better than apple why did they have to copy and steal all of apples designs, ideas, and innovations? Obviously apple is superior, or else everyone wouldnt be coming out with their own versions of apples products.
ZONEofTECH Dude u make cry u make me question myself why!? Why!?
ZONEofTECH this phone is so shit
ZONEofTECH who cares about the pixels there both about the same
ZONEofTECH This is quite possible, the most interesting video Ive seen.
ZONEofTECH For fuck sake just get on with it
ZONEofTECH IM GETTING 1 IN NOVEMBER!!!! YAY!
ZONEofTECH lol, you think you are funny replying to your own comment
ZONEofTECH Lol smaller box means more boxes can fit witch means they use less gas lol Omg that is so hilarious.
ZONEofTECH I just wanna see this and idk why Im seeing this
ZONEofTECH next time show whats on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH 2:39 did he just says iPhone 3GS, sext?
ZONEofTECH Tell me why Im watching this
ZONEofTECH Very informative  interesting video about the iPhone 3GS, do you have one on all the other iPhones (past  future)?
ZONEofTECH This video is so funny because hes recording this with an iphone 4
ZONEofTECH I want the 3gs for mmy birrhday
ZONEofTECH Hey ZONEofTECH! Do you still use your iPhone 3G?
ZONEofTECH Apply ice on burned area
ZONEofTECH Fuck it I will buy 3gs
ZONEofTECH Who does a iPhone 3GS unboxing when it came out 4 years ago!!
ZONEofTECH Yeah were not here to see the review of the box . .
ZONEofTECH Who watches a video of a phone that came out 4 years ago?
ZONEofTECH Who Want the iPhone 3GS or iPhone 4G or even 4S this Smart Phones has Gone! I love to see people get the latest New Powerful SmartPhones because Camera, face camera Lovely, performance  New Apps New Programs!
ZONEofTECH the iphone 4s looks way better then the stupid 3gs
ZONEofTECH I was wondering if you can delete the Compass app or do you have to keep it?
ZONEofTECH Does anyone know what the music was in the beginning?
ZONEofTECH Pentru ca filmele mele se adreseaza tuturor celor pasionati de tehnologie, nu doar celor din Romania.
ZONEofTECH Man I remember seeing this when it came out back then. I had a motorolla razor phone and really wanted this one but was stuck until I was due for an upgrade and I have the iphone 4 32gb now. I was so jealous that everyone had an iphone but me. But I am so happy I finally have one :)
ZONEofTECH Just bought this a few weeks ago from Gamestop really cheap. Dont give a fuck what snobbish assholes wanna say about it. I didnt even have a smartphone before, so it was an upgrade for me. Sure, it sucks compared to newer phones, but my quality of life is not diminished by having an older phone.
ZONEofTECH Mate u just dont no anything
ZONEofTECH Say iPhone 5 5 times then post this on two other viedos
ZONEofTECH Hi, i recently upgraded to a Samsung SSD 840 pro and enabled trim but the hard drive has started freezing, have you had this experience and is there a solution
ZONEofTECH thank you so muccch!!!!
ZONEofTECH Thank you as well :D Be sure to SUBSCRIBE if you enjoyed my content :) Cheers a104036 :)
ZONEofTECH Running latest version of OSX and Samsung 840 250gb and this worked as described :)
ZONEofTECH Can I use ONYX and Ccleaner with SSD disk?
ZONEofTECH Thx youuu :D Be sure to SUBSCRIBE, Like and Share this video if you found it useful. Thanks again :) Cheers!
ZONEofTECH This works on my late 2011 Macbook Pro. I just upgraded my 7200 RPM HDD to a Samsung 840 500GB SSD with the latest Mountain Lion OSX 10.8.3! It does require a restart after the initial launch and patch to work. You sir, have earned my like  subscription.
ZONEofTECH under about this mac and system report i dont have anything that says trim support. Why is that?
ZONEofTECH The trimmer app? Which one? the one from iMovie?
ZONEofTECH the trimer enabler.sorry for the type error. if you check the comments on the site provided from you as well as from other ones that i googled it seems that theres been some kind of incompatibility issue
ZONEofTECH War is up. Costs 300 just to fix!
ZONEofTECH i dropedd my iphone 3g in water for 1 second and now is deed
ZONEofTECH U had that u just put it in the box with all the stuff
ZONEofTECH The 3G3GS back looks like a mouse
ZONEofTECH When I got my iPhone 3G they didnt even put a charger
ZONEofTECH le puedes poner wahtsapp
ZONEofTECH can i have it!!!!????
ZONEofTECH Lol, THIS was incredible just a couple years ago
ZONEofTECH subscribe is the message
ZONEofTECH THANKS FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO I RALLY NEED TO FIND AN ONBOXING OF IPHONE 3G AND U GAVE IT TO ME. THANKS
ZONEofTECH can u pleases give this to me
ZONEofTECH dat helt me a lot because the iphone so stupid wid itunes
ZONEofTECH I have had portable Apple products for like 6 years, and when you said Get it? FINGER TIPS That was the very first time that I ever got it. Thank you sooo much.
ZONEofTECH 1. Because Romanians dont watch such videos, they are more popular in the USUK. 2. Because I will be going to the university in the UK, which will not only improve my English language skills, but will also give me a change of becoming a YouTube partner (which is not possible in Romania). Be sure to SUBSCRIBE to my channel for more videos!! Ive been putting a lot of effort in making them so a SUBSCRIPTION from you would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH Great video! Upgrading to an SSD was the best move I ever madeespecially because I dual boot.One strange thing: I back up to a 5400 RPM 1TB SeaGate GoFlex HDD over 2x faster than your internal hard drive, and thats via Firewire 800. It doesnt make sense.
ZONEofTECH hehe awsome :D I made a video on how to enable trim. Check it out :) Please SHARE my videos so more people can see them cause at the moment I dont have that many views :(
ZONEofTECH and the shut down time is only handy when your girlfriend walks in when you where watching porn if she minds)
ZONEofTECH Also, about the movement test, it doesnt really matter for HDDs anymore. Theyve become extremely efficient and accurate and wont fail if you move them unless you throw your laptop out of a window, but the point is SSDs last longer cuz they cant wear down mechanicallyPhysically.
ZONEofTECH I have a 1 TB hdd at 5400rpm and im looking into upgrading to ssd, this vid is exactly what i was looking for lol.
ZONEofTECH Interesting video. The part about the SSD being immune to shocks is not true though. They are less prone to a mechanical drive, but they still can damage quite easily from shock.
ZONEofTECH Whats the point in my HP Windows 8.1 Laptop I got SSD and HDD at the same time :P
ZONEofTECH is there a possibility to have both the ssd and the hdd harddrive ?
ZONEofTECH Whats the name of that song or beat in the background ?
ZONEofTECH Why do Germans get the best music?
ZONEofTECH Hello Zoneoftech should i ditch my Macbook pro 13 2011 stock for an Macbook air 13 haswell?
ZONEofTECH Well, Internet Recovery ONLY reinstalls your OS (LionMountain Lion) and only works on 2011 or newer MBPs. After you got your OS onto your new SSD, you have to restore your data from a Time Machine Backup.
ZONEofTECH How can i get Mac OS on a new ssd? MacBook Pro 2009? Just insert the disk? And how to start the disk installation ?
ZONEofTECH This seriously made a HUGE improvement on my macbook pro. Is completely as good as advertised and this video made it all too easy for a rookie to do!!
ZONEofTECH I love the Darth Vader breathing at the end.
ZONEofTECH I have this one buy in green I got it on EBay. 8 GB.I got one Brand new for X mass in 2007the Red one but i brooke it trying to take the back cover off.
ZONEofTECH Had one till my cousin chucked it in a corn field
ZONEofTECH I just brought a use one this style ipod didnt know it was this old I guess should did research I pay way to much for it...
ZONEofTECH Thanks a lot :D Q: Do you think I should keep the spinning ZONEofTECH logo in the bottom right corner that used to be in my previews videos?
ZONEofTECH this was also my first ever apple product, I got it when it was first released when I was 9 :L i still have it, its the 8gb blue version. I have since gotten the apple iPad 2 (white, 32gb , wifi model) , the 5th gen iPod nano (blue, 8gb ) and I recently just got the 5th gen iPod touch (silver Nd white 64gb version.) Im soon hoping to add a iPhone 5 or maybe even the 4s to my apple collection :D
ZONEofTECH Haha :D thats great :) By the way, I have a playlist in which I upload only Apple videos so be sure to check it out. I have a bunch of reviews, comparison and stuff like that. Also, be sure to SUBSCRIBE to my channel, if you enjoyed my content and would like to see more :) Cheers !
ZONEofTECH Where can I get one brand new ?
ZONEofTECH hahaha i have the same ipod nano and it too was my first venture into buying an apple product, it was the first ipod that i actually liked and still like to this day, i just went to game stop and bought a used but well taken care of black 8 gig ipod nano 3rd gen and i plan to keep using then till they stop working.
ZONEofTECH i still use mine up to today 2013
ZONEofTECH I dont have anything against apple, its just not me. This little gadget however has me wanting to buy one lol. In my own opinion this is the best design for the ipod nano ever made.
ZONEofTECH Yeah, good old times. Be sure to subscribe if you liked this video, like it, even favorite it if you want. Ill be posting over 30 videos in the upcoming days, all of them filmed in 1080p. It would help me a lot, since at the moment I do not have so many subscribers, nor views. Thank you
ZONEofTECH SOLVED: It seems that one of my RAM is loose. Thats what the 3 beeps meant.
ZONEofTECH I had this last year. It lasted 9 months, first the light went out, then the fan stopped working. But all in all it worked very well, plus I got it off eBay for 67 with bucks (Free shipping).
ZONEofTECH Nah, I usually talk like that when presenting the product. Its quite difficult for me to make these videos in English, since its not my first language. Anyway, thx you again for watching and also for subbing :) Oh, and thx for the extra views, its really appreciated.
ZONEofTECH Does this work well when gaming? Because when I play Skyrim or any games my laptop goes to hot like a fire! XD
ZONEofTECH how loud is the noise in dB (decibel)?
ZONEofTECH Does anyone know where i can get it in the uk
ZONEofTECH where did you get it, and what is it called?

screenjunkies Phr33Pur3 neither do I, but hipsters used to be a smaller part of trendsetters, allways stating that they started wearing this and listening to that BEFORE it was popular. remember? hipsters used to not go with social trends, at least thats what they thought.
screenjunkies this person who is now dead literally should have called 911 and not just commented about it on youtube.
screenjunkies Ed Helms being such a douche. He takes it SOOOOO serious xD

screenjunkies that tshirt should be a crime to wear in public
screenjunkies A buddy komedy flick with Flula and Jason Segel would KILL.
screenjunkies Where do I get the Tshirt with the laser beam eye cat? Can I get the Amazing Flula to sign it?

retrogametech My Dreamcast ended up with a hole drilled in it when I tried to get the screws out to press in the contacts at the front (a common problem) and used a removable screw head (it got stuck), had to get it drilled out. It worked fine after though. Tried it recently and it carried on a bit and the ground became see through in Crazy Taxi.
retrogametech segadreamer No it was a blown cap on the PSU. I replaced it and it worked fine again.
retrogametech shutuptv100 in europe it was changed to blue as a company owned the rights to a orange swirl as there logo the comp was Tivola
retrogametech hey mate, i blew my psu too.. can i just ask: what did u replace? was it the whole psu, or just the blown capacitor? thanks. im no good with electronics, but if replacing the capacitor fixes it then its going to save me quite a bit of money. cheers

Then your voice appears on his videos in full Transformers mode and you start thinking wait a minute...this is just a birthday roast! And Jon, I know that Sean is your friend and all, but he might look to get out and date one in a while instead of surrounding himself with toys. I mean, you have a wife and kids and still do toy reviews. Just saying. And meeting booby Cosplayers at ComicCons DOES NOT COUNT!

screenjunkies Durante quando o narrador fala o Estrelando, d para perceber que ele no se segura, e comea rir! KKKKKKKKKK
screenjunkies kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies Eu at que gostei do filme, mas no mostrou nada alm do desenho.
screenjunkies conseguem transformar um desenho bom num filme pssimo
screenjunkies Vince Vaughn is a FUCKING WEIRDO!!!
screenjunkies is vince vaughn dead? at that point he should of just walked off. what a retarded interview
screenjunkies WHY WAS SIGNS MORE HATED THAN AFTER EARTH?
screenjunkies Vince Vaughn doesnt even know what his own characters do in the movies...
screenjunkies inhale cringe exhale loudly
screenjunkies Gotta be when hal made the lance armstrong crack, then immediately reached for the computer, after Vaughn said he didnt wanna use google.
screenjunkies I thought every one hated The Last Airbender?
screenjunkies Something funny in the coments below! Give me my t shirt.
screenjunkies The Internship... its a poor excuse for a google advert, calling it a movie would be a huge overstatement. And it makes no sense.Vince Vaughn needs to teach the good nerds how to live. Interestingly this is also the only major difference between the good nerds and the bad nerd.The advert teaches you, that nerds can be either disgusting and geeky, or evil. Nothing else makes sense, but this is almost offensive to me.
screenjunkies Something funny... :P
screenjunkies God, this interview cringes me.
screenjunkies While The Last Airbender is abhorrently bad, After Earth is much worse.
screenjunkies Where do you most get on Vince Vaughns nerve? Right here, Vince Vaughn Googles Himself! where he is looking offscreen at his agentmanager trying to feel when how to get your ass yanked.
screenjunkies Vince Vaughn sucks!!!
screenjunkies Haha, it was when he looked at the cameraagent with a WTF look at 2:24.
screenjunkies When you waved goodbye at the end you reminded me of the retarded policeman...
screenjunkies He got most annoyed when you asked him about Jennifer Anniston
screenjunkies Think you struck a nerve there with the whole Jen Anniston spiel
screenjunkies I got spoiled by Lonely Island on Sixth Sense
screenjunkies Happy Birthday, Joe! I hope everyone is nice to you this evening.
screenjunkies The questions are dumb, in fact hes visibly annoying one of the mechanicsI thought you where going to ask technical questions not troll the mechanics with retarded questions.
screenjunkies Most of the action sequences in FF, for that matter other car chase movie, are filmed at lower speeds. Then they dub in more engine noise in post production. The opening scene of the first FF movie , where they were hijacking the truck is pure Hollywood.
screenjunkies Jeff seem like a cool guy to roll a Heisenberg, what his number?
screenjunkies The Rock acts a whole lot better so...THE ROCKBut....Vin Diesels mumbling is sort of one of a kind.Hmmm
screenjunkies Vin diesel he used to be a bouncer at a night club in NYC
screenjunkies Drop it out of a plane! LOL!
screenjunkies for all those planning to watch fast  furious 6. keep in mind: way to get ur car up 190mph is to drop from an airplane.
screenjunkies I like a Rock. I mean, THE rock.
screenjunkies Vin Diesel is better than The Rock because while Vin Diesels acting seriously leaves something to be desired, compared to watching The Rocks acting selfmutilation seems preferable.
screenjunkies A Scion xb drift? The real answer is no not without a drive train swap. Fwd cars dont drift, they power slide.
screenjunkies Find someone less annoying than this guy to do the videos. Honest trailers is a 9.610. This guys video is a 2.410
screenjunkies If I wanted to street race this scion, what should I do ....buy a faster car
screenjunkies Yo, fuck you, hes great.
screenjunkies You can rotate the cabin 180 degrees making it a RWD car
screenjunkies The rock was in wwe and could beat the other mans ass
screenjunkies The Rock did Doom  Vin Diesel never did anything that bad.
screenjunkies Is he your boyfriend?
screenjunkies NW independent german auto repairs represented by Latino guy with Hitler mustash or so :) u wouldnt believe but my PC soundcard broke down on it with downsampling from 41. khz to like 800Hz...
screenjunkies Looks like youre getting a screenjunkies tshirt.
screenjunkies Rock beats paper.. And Vin Diesel
screenjunkies A robot can act with more passion an believability then Vin Diesel can
screenjunkies Bryce Dallas Howard as Dr. Crusher
screenjunkies I cannot disagree with Hugh Jackman as Picard. Hes the only character who would have that warmth that Patrick Stewart brought to the role. Of the three, Hughs the only one I can see saying, Make it so, in a manner similar to Patricks
screenjunkies I would have james mcavoy as Picard and Jim parsons as data... Just think about it.
screenjunkies I would have Patrick Stewart as Picard !
screenjunkies Charles ShaughnessyBradley CooperMichael Jay WhiteTom HiddlestonJon Michael HillSibel KekilliLily TailorDanai Gurira...and if you REALLY want to count Wesley in,.... Nathan Vetterlein
screenjunkies For Dr. Crusher, I replace with Jewel Belair Staite.
screenjunkies I try to take an objective side in debates like this. But this guy, this first guy on the far left in the red shirt.My initial thoughts when I heard Reboot TNG were: Just dont.Then after that when I was hearing the reasons and characters: 0:51 to 1:10 I just wanted to staple the guys mouth shut.I havent seen breaking bad, Ive got a long list of stuff to watch, but from what that guy says, this Heisenberg is nowhere near what JeanLuc Picard is as a character. Maybe its my inner Trekkie, but from the moment he started talking I could just feel the rage bubbling up from my gut. It wasnt the bad rage, it was the passionate rage. I love TNG, I just dont want it to become something that its not. Im midway through a Tolkien movie crisis because the Hobbit films are pretty much shitting on my hopes at the moment. (Maybe this is how the star wars diehards feel)
screenjunkies NNNNNooooooooooooo!!!! These fucking movies should have NEVER BEEN MADE AT ALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies I hope they dont reboot it if they dont have Patrick Stuart. Lets face it, Picard is only Picard because of Patrick Stuart. Take that away and its no longer Picard.
screenjunkies Im sorry but I cant see anyone else playing PicardPatrick Stewart is the ONE AND ONLY Picard!
screenjunkies If there has to be yet another scifi reboot, Id like it to be Space: 1999. That one kind of cries out for reboot treatment. I remember hearing some studio was going to do it a couple years ago, but now it seems to be languishing in development hell with no end in sight.
screenjunkies Although I think its good that they give their own dream cast (which is basically just their opinion), I quite disagree with who theyre picking.Dont get me wrong, the actors they chose are good actors, but..To me, the cast or TNG was quite young.. I dont know the real ages of the actors who played Data or Geordi or anyone else when they were in TNG, but they all look around twenty to thirty years old. (Except Picard ofcourse) I hope that IF they reboot TNG, they pick young looking actors and put A LOT of effort into it. Go big or go home. You know that if you dont do it good, youll get hate from the fandoms :(I came across a good example of an actor who could play Data, Tom Hiddleston. If you look it up on Google youll find some photoshopped pictures of Tom as Data and they look quite good to me :)
screenjunkies Ayelet Zurher (Lara LorVan, Supermans birthmom in Man Of Steel) as Deanna Troi.
screenjunkies Needs a brand new crew for a reboot of ST:TNG. Hate the idea of trying to recast a winning cast. However with the remakes of STOS, JJ Abrams was smart to go younger and then have them grow up as the original cast. But for ST:TNG, a whole new crew is needed. B4 would be Datas counterpart on the show. As for the rest, I say keep the nuclear family dynamic and look into the problems associated with today. Such as a Gay captain, a transgendered doctor, an alien married couple, unmarried parents, adoption, and others.
screenjunkies Bryan cranson is not playing anymore bald characters. Get over it fanboys. Breaking bad is over.
screenjunkies In a few years perhaps they can do the original cast of this and any other remake of any kind, as utterly flawlessly realistic computer generated characters, so still Bil Shatner or Patrick Stewart, or even the late DeForest Kelley and (pardon my forgetfullness whoever played the original Scotty)
screenjunkies XD keep it whoopy made my night
screenjunkies Funny that they mentioned Lost to Star Trek not being a very huge leap, I think Terry OQuinn would be a good Picard.
screenjunkies keep it whoopie, fuckin great.
screenjunkies dude is abrams got his hands on NextGeneration it would actually, literally, no joke, kill people from the badness.
screenjunkies I would prefer Hugh Jackman over Walter White for Picard. I dont think I would be able to take Worf seriously if Terry Crews played him.
screenjunkies worf doesnt need to be black
screenjunkies this is just sad i hope that patrick stewart is long dead before picard is recasted in his place and focus on the current startrek cast. the first star trek had i think five movies and years before tng was broadcasted and if the show is reboot im sure the fans will be pleased to see star trek still active but im writing a fanfiction apart from any current star trek time line with naomi wieldman is an aging admiral in star fleet becuase rather then recasting an old franchise i think we should move on and boldly go where no man has gone before.
screenjunkies Couldnt we just do a new TNG movie with the original cast, with Bryan Cranston as the villain or something?
screenjunkies What a shitty beam out.
screenjunkies I think he should reboot Firefly
screenjunkies There.....are.....four....Lights
screenjunkies sorry guys, but Ive never seen such a bunch of lame stupid people! Kevin (the second on the left) is the only one who still has a brain. The dude with the yellow shirt just belongs to an asilum for retarded
screenjunkies Ralph Fiennes  Captain JeanLuc PicardMichael Fassbender  William T. RikerChiwetel Ejiofor  Geordi La ForgeMarion Cotillard  Deanna TroiWalton Goggins  DataDjimon Hounsou  WorfAlex Kingston  Beverly CrusherYvette Nicole Brown  GuinanLast and certainly least Christopher MintzPlasse  Wesley Crusher
screenjunkies I hate the way they only want Cranston to play the same character he does in Breaking Bad, I am sure he good enough an actor to be just as dignified and diplomatic in his own way, perhaps with a fake French accent, and not have to play the same character as in Breaking Bad. The shows over! And I am sad to say that Next Generation is over too, its been a couple decades now, but most of the cast is still alive, and reboots are an extreme artistic cop out anyway, its almost as if scifi has officially declared itself dead by reducing itself to dystopias, reboots, and superhero movie after superhero movie, and with so many chubby males 3060 losing their shit over something that is like 88 CG, like video games they are too lazy to play. Its like peoples imaginations are so destroyed they rely on others like it was a drug.
screenjunkies Why must everything good be fucked up??? There already is a Star Trek The Next Generation, just leave it alone. They have already destroyed Star Wars and V, could you at least leave us TNG???
screenjunkies I do love me some Zach braff, but this seems kind of shameless, Zach
screenjunkies DontBackZach Hah! Sign me up.Indie GoGo: http:igg.meatdontbackzachScreenJunkies ZachBraff Kickstarter
screenjunkies If its always to see anyone full retard, its just disheartening to see some of your favorite entertainers go FULL retard.
screenjunkies Oh, and Ill have to defer to Mel Brooks on the two rules to funding a production from the musicalplay The Producers Rule number one. Never Ever Never use your own money. Max Whats rule number Two Max?  Bloom NEVER USE YOUR OWN MONNNEEEEEEEEYYYYYY!!!!  Max, very loud.
screenjunkies I find it hilarious how only 746 was raised XD
screenjunkies Donate 50 dollars and get an exclusive limited run tshirt. Funny because Im like Yo! Thats 50 dollars for a tshirt. Limited edition, lets do some simple addition, 50 dollars for a tshirt, thats just some ignorant bitch.
screenjunkies Yeah...why dont we donate 2 million to keep people from making a movie. How about a 10 million dollar campaign to tell people what they shouldnt spend their money on.
screenjunkies Well this guy is a jackass.
screenjunkies Is this supposed to be satirical?
screenjunkies What if he just wanted people involved with it I mean seriously .....why not make a video on Matt Damon trying gr
screenjunkies Unless this is some form of metatrolling where you purposefully become hypocrites to reveal the stupidity of the situation, this is fucking stupid. Dont back people with money to do vanity projects that they could fund themselves, now fund us to make a vanity project that we could fund ourselves. GENIUS TROLLING OR COMPLETE HYPOCRISY! I agree that perhaps the money could be put to better use or other projects by those with less financial clout but really? Not worth an Indiegogo campaign :P
screenjunkies Ye, cos obviously people want to donate their money for a joke.... Mabey I should give my life savings to my mate, uno...for the lols
screenjunkies did he pay you money to say that...because you know, hes fucking rich.
screenjunkies Zach Braff isnt worth 22 million and it doesnt seem like you know anything about making decent movies. Let people back the things they want to see. Why are you taking away from him for trying to do the things he wants? Also, his appearance on kickstarter put 500000 into unrelated projects and brought 40,000 people to the site. So why is this bad? Why so bitter?
screenjunkies Agreed my Jewish friend.
screenjunkies screenjunkies, I dont know your exact purpose (and im willing to admit that, because it isnt important) but an organization hating on one person isnt exactly commendable. You guys let this guy get in front of a camera without any REAL factual evidence that what Zach Braff is doing is wrong. It makes everyone look bad. If this is the guy presenting on behalf of you guys, does that mean that everybody is at his level? or does it even mean that there is even more ignorance behind the scenes?
screenjunkies The only good thing about this channel are the honest trailers.
screenjunkies Dont back Zack! you guys have fallen for his bullshit like a couple of scrubs.
screenjunkies Just dont give him money if you dont like the idea?! I mean, its as easy as that. Geez!
screenjunkies Amen! I barely have enough money to eat a burrito, let alone pay for a friggin millionaire to make a movie. PS, this campaign is CLEARLY a satire. But satire is kind of a big word, so I get why lots of people wouldnt get it ...
screenjunkies But he is also a multimillionaire.
screenjunkies A Syrian Film wouldve been far more innapropriate!
screenjunkies Should I eat the cuttlefish and asparagus, or the vanilla paste?
screenjunkies lol The genius of this film is that the worst parts r all implied rather than shown. highly effective disturbing horror. this film is not for everyone. Extreme horror.
screenjunkies I watched the whole Dexter series with my mum... it got pretty awkward during the sex scenes!
screenjunkies That is the most grossest movie ever
screenjunkies I feel sorry for your mom
screenjunkies GROSS DUDE SO GROSS .how whud thay take a bath and dude and the chapenies guy tuck a shit in her moth
screenjunkies This director is sick . And messed up
screenjunkies I imagine this movie was awkward to film
screenjunkies The most awkward thing Ive ever watched with my parents, might have been when me and my dad saw The Watchmen in theaters and the sex scene came on. We were both so damn uncomfortable, I saw his arm twitch and raise up a little like he wanted to reach over and cover both our eyes lol
screenjunkies dude, your mum is awesome
screenjunkies hahah! your mom is so cute! i love how she covers your eyes and says, dont watch that, i couldnt stop laughing.XD
screenjunkies Who would watch that with their mom
screenjunkies the first human centipede is horrible and boring, saw the second one and i loved it, awdward, gross, horrifing great movie
screenjunkies What a fucking wanker. Why in the hell would you make your mother watch this bullshit.
screenjunkies At least in the first one, I was able to sit through it fairly easyily. In the second one, I had to force myself to watch it. It just makes me so sick. Glad I watched it though so I dont feel like Im missing something lol.
screenjunkies The perfect mothers day present
screenjunkies Oh god I lived it again...
screenjunkies My mom and dad always change the channel when it gets to sexual ahha
screenjunkies I wasnt crazy about Pacific Rim. The action was EPIC, but the story just wasnt interesting to me...
screenjunkies You cant call Lone Ranger a family movie  unless you have major money to pay for therapy! The movie opens with the villain punching a guy in the chest, pulling out his heart, and then eating it! Any sane parents would join the mass exodus from the theater immediately after the first scene and line up for a refund of the ticket price. Seriously, what was your childhood like if you believe THAT is a good family movie?! You have my pity.
screenjunkies After watching this, I wanted to see how close they were. At least Amy knows how to do her job.Kristian (610)Amy (810)Devin (610)Hal (710)1) Iron Man 3 (409)2) Despicable Me 2 (367)3) Man of Steel (291)4) Monsters University (268.5)5) Fast  Furious 6 (238.7)6) Star Trek Into Darkness (228.8)7) World War Z (202.4)8) The Heat (159.6)9) The Great Gatsby (144.8)10) The Conjuring (137.4)
screenjunkies Pacific rim and man of steel were utter crap, and iron man 3? Come on!!!!! I had to play it (upon DVD release) like several times just to finish it, bored the crap outta me
screenjunkies Where did you get those numbers? Iron Man 3 made like 1.4 Billionaaronfialho
screenjunkies Wow Devin faragi you say the most hilarious things  iron man 3 is what people want from a marvel movie star trek is garbage and not a popular franchise winny wolverine emo peter is perfect im ROTFL!!!!!
screenjunkies Iron man 3Monsters uDespicable me 2WolverinePacific rimStar Trek into darknessSmurfs 2Man of steelLone Ranger
screenjunkies Any chance that youll veer release extended versions of these videos? Id really love to see everyones full thoughts
screenjunkies I dont know about everyone else but iron man sucked, fucking awful movie
screenjunkies Iron Man 3 sucked all kinds of ass in my opinion
screenjunkies That guy on the left is an Assclown.
screenjunkies Kristian Harloff, where did you get your shirt. I WANT ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies oh lord these people were so dumb
screenjunkies Ironman 3 almost as bad as daredevil
screenjunkies 2013 summer had so much movies I LOVED IT!
screenjunkies despicable me 2 beat monsters university the lone ranger and it was the number 1 movie in the world but iron man was only 1 movie in America and I think man of steel beat 10 times better than iron man 3
screenjunkies These guys was rite about TLR.
screenjunkies Star Trek and Pacific Rim were both epic movies, Grown ups 2 etc can go fuck themselves :
screenjunkies I hate all these people sometimes.Sometimes I dont mind them
screenjunkies The wolverine is gonna be better than man of steel maybe not more money but it kinda sucks
screenjunkies Grown ups 2 was also good wtf
screenjunkies Fast 6: oh you thought I wasnt gonna do well in box office? FUCK YOUR FACTS
screenjunkies That awkward moment when you though iron man 3 was gonna be amazing, until you actually watched it in theaters and was severely disappointed.
screenjunkies Why isnt Kick Ass 2 on either of their lists!!
screenjunkies Can we have a follow up of this video?
screenjunkies his friend maddawged me HA at least he noticed, that close of marky mark made me laugh so hard
screenjunkies Mike Tyson, i would just cry and try kissing his feet. Maybe i would be so exited that i would puke or something :D
screenjunkies .....wow...just......wow.
screenjunkies jackie chan!!! i would flip out if i met him!!!and i would ask questions that no other western interviewer have asked....like how many bones have u broken? show us a punch....show us a kickwhats the worst injury u had?? blah blah
screenjunkies I just realized right now that the ROCK reminds me of a President Obama ripped and on roids! If Obama started pumping iron and got super big and shaved his head.. hmm...
screenjunkies Id blubber like a baby if I ever met Bryan Cranston.
screenjunkies Quentin Tarantino or Michael Fassbender
screenjunkies Jim Carrey, Robert Downey Jr, Slash, Johnny Depp or Eminem :) Also Freddie Mercury and Michael Jackson, but its impossible to meet them because of a very obvious reason :D
screenjunkies Fat guy : OMFG The Rock!The Rock : Uhh k?Marky Mark : Fucking wrestling fans.
screenjunkies So this was one of the featured pages on youtube and just because of this video i wont watch another screen junkies video. ha u guys suck!
screenjunkies Lol. You gotta control your fanboy.
screenjunkies arnold schwarzenegger and chuck norris, hope i wrote arnolds last name correct.. i would absolutely pee myself.
screenjunkies Adam West and i would say nana nana nana nana BATMAN!
screenjunkies Hal Rudnick and Nick Mundy
screenjunkies For me it would be Hugh Jackman because he is the sexiest man I have ever seen and I can say that without being ashamed or anything because thats the thing I just have to be honest about.
screenjunkies omygosh i fully understand this. this is exactly how i feel about leonardo dicaprio. like, why is anybodys else presence necessary when youve got him in front of you? awesome dude (giveleoanoscar )
screenjunkies PLEASE LET ME MEET ROBERT DOWNEY JR ANDOR HUGH JACKMAN!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE MAKE MY DREAM COME TRUE!!!!!!!
screenjunkies I would meet Chuck Norris, then Vaporize from sheer awesome
screenjunkies Is it wrong to say nerdcubed?
screenjunkies He was wearing the Sign Guy colours at 1:33 !
screenjunkies Bryan Cranston for sure.
screenjunkies i was hoping this was going to be funny. I am dissapoint.
screenjunkies I would flip out if I met Quentin Tarantino I am a HUGE fan if his work.

screenjunkies o cara do jurassic park uhauha
screenjunkies Kkkkk.. muito foda hahha.. as gmeas Olsen. .. esse filme  fodis
screenjunkies This was a pretty trivial guide, it didnt really tell much about the story so far. Just the characters.
screenjunkies What is it about the good guys in T.V. shows being amongst the most excruciatingly boring, humourless, dull and dreary of all?...Watching (enduring) Rob Stark and John Snow is like succumbing to carbon monoxide poisoning  colourless, tasteless, odourless (well, 2 out of 3 aint bad) but anaesthetising to say the least. Then we have Sheriff Rick Grimes of The Walking Dead  boringno sense of humour whatsoever, followed by Dexter Morgan, the majority of superheroes  apart from perhaps Ironman, Hancock and that Green Lantern guy.
screenjunkies Favorite character: Hot pie
screenjunkies Geoffrey and his little stupid squeaky voice. I mean seriously, isnt he meant to be around 18 and his voice still hasnt broken. Plus hes a little sh.
screenjunkies i hate tht entire fkn show...
screenjunkies Theon GreyJoy is not a honorary stark, rather a captive hostage ward
screenjunkies Favorites: I havent ever watched the show lol.
screenjunkies The show is all about the Starks getting fucked
screenjunkies Favorite: Arya StarkAnnoying: Sansa StarkHate: Melisandre and Joffrey
screenjunkies um is it bad that i havent watched game of thrones?
screenjunkies This is like 90 season 3 stuff
screenjunkies make a simpler version please i found it extremely hard to understand
screenjunkies If you read the books then this video would be unessisary and it cersee
screenjunkies favorite characters: Thyrion,Daenerys,Arya and Robbcharacters I hate: Joeffrey,Theon,Viserys,Stannis and his redheaded devil wifecharacters I like as well but arent that relevant: Hodor, Shae, fat kid, Bronn,Sansa,Bran,Sam,the one with dirty hairannoying characters: Johah Mormont,Jon Snow,lord Baelish..characters I dont care about at all: Catelyn,Brianne of Tarth, Tywin, Lorashottest characters: Khal Drogo,Robb Stark,Daenerys,Cersei.CHARACTERS I USED TO HATE BUT I DONT ANYMORE: Jaime,Khal Drogo
screenjunkies freaaeakking jhon snowwwwwwww..and tywin
screenjunkies Forgot oneSamwell Tarleyspecial kind of courage. Courage that comes from desperation. Probably the only true courage anyway.
screenjunkies Favourite: TyrionAryia Most Hated: JeofferyDaenerys brother
screenjunkies Sir Bangshersisteralot xD
screenjunkies I love Ramsay cuz he fucked up Theon but they also make Theon look like a massive asshole in the show and he isnt nearly that bad in the books. I also love Arya and Dany in the books and Tyrion will always and forever be my favorite of all time.
screenjunkies Favorite characters: Tyrion, Ned Stark, Jon Snow, Arya Stark, faceless assassinHated: Joffrey, Theon Greyjoy
screenjunkies Joffrey needed to go for like 19 episodes ago hes the kind of vile character that astonishingly never seems to get whats coming to him. The Hound is the best one !!
screenjunkies hottest: the dragons!!coolest: the white walker general!most hated: the mountain! Hes such a mother
screenjunkies If I say my favorite character they will most likely die in season 4.
screenjunkies Im HBO fan but I have never seen Game of Thrones. After seeing this, I still dont want to watch it
screenjunkies My favorite character is Olenna Tyrell, she steals the scene everytime shes on.
screenjunkies Not cool what you said about Tyrion, just saying..
screenjunkies Favourite character: Terian. Hes a little badass dwarf that does whats right and isnt scared of anyone. Most annoying character: Sam. Theres just something about his loveable blunderingness that pisses me off. Most hated: Joffery. Who else would it be? Hes a coward, a spoiled brat, an abusive asshole, and he thinks he can do whatever he wants becuase hes king and no one can stop him.
screenjunkies Inconvenient truth fest wait someones at the door

screenjunkies just thought of an epic game just really hope no one else posted this.How I Met Your Mother Power Hour. Rules: Play 500 miles By The Proclaimers on a constant loop sipping (or slugging your choice, Im not youre mother) beer on the minute mark and a shot every time the song changes (liquor of your choice i recommend a bitchy type drink cuz its gonna get messy). Do this for an hour. Good Luck... Youre absolutley gonna need it.
screenjunkies 1:46 Hal smile looked like the joker if he was severely bleeding from the mouth
screenjunkies It should have been every time Jesse says bitch and everytime you see a boob on game of thrones
screenjunkies Drink a shot every time Batman does a Batman Squint.
screenjunkies Well TWD is easy, one for each dead walker.
screenjunkies Dude the goal is to get drunk not end up in the morgue.
screenjunkies One show inspired its own: Supernatural: purple nurples! Not sure whats in it, but theres a drinking game too.
screenjunkies Caipirinha!!! Simply delicious :D
screenjunkies Any News program  Drink whenever they mention something thats supposed to make you terrified, but which has less chance of actually affecting you than butterfly farts. The Drink  Perspective, 1 part Everclear, 1000 parts anything else.
screenjunkies Ancient Aliens drinking game  take a shot every time the narrator says the phrase As some ancient alien theorist believe...  first one to get abducted wins
screenjunkies Every time Ygritte says You know nothing Jon Snow.
screenjunkies Family Guy. Every time Peter does a flashback, drink a whole bottle of Jack Daniels so you cant remember anything.
screenjunkies Drink a shot every time Morgan Freeman narrates something badly... I am 40 years sober.
screenjunkies Who else skipped the GIRLS part cause you never seen, almost never heard of the show?
screenjunkies Watch Harry Potter and take a drink of a combination of cream soda and butterscotch shnops (butter beer) every time Ron makes a funnyweird face.
screenjunkies Futurama, Each time bender says Ass drink a beer )
screenjunkies it was xenophobic towards irish people not racist.
screenjunkies When reading Star Wars books: whenever the Jedi do something stupid and screw up the galaxy drink a lomin ale. (Beer with green food coloring) When watching STNG: whenever the Counselor uses the Force for absolutely no reason have a shot...
screenjunkies every time walter scolds jessie for screwing up
screenjunkies Twighlight: drink for every minute that you are hating the movie and questioning your sexuality
screenjunkies For years I was thinking that Osama ruling USA, I would not except that fault from Osama..
screenjunkies May the 4th! It would drive my girlfriend NUTS, especially if I dressed up
screenjunkies fandom day every fandom from otaku to whovein will be praised and given one thing from their respected choice from what ever series TV video games or otherwise
screenjunkies Give Obama a break Star Trek likely wasnt popular in Kenya when he was born. LolSiFi holiday how about July 8th Roswell crash day
screenjunkies Starday as in patriotic stars and starwars, startreck, etc.
screenjunkies Whether you be a Star Wars or Star Trek fan, space day would be perfect for everyone.
screenjunkies This was really cute, I have to say.
screenjunkies He only said three words on national television, its not like zombies are going to attack everybody because of some obscure email with the word zombie in itdont quote me on this i think Im tired or high
screenjunkies I nereded on the myself a little
screenjunkies I thought Halloween was the nerd hollyday, but then again cool people do it too...well, theres always ComicCon )
screenjunkies An Urgent Message to Obama from All Nerds.
screenjunkies Like Gandalf told Charles Xavier, with great power comes great responsibility! :p
screenjunkies OMG! HE DID THAT. Execute orders 66 NOW!!!!!!
screenjunkies can you just SHUT UP!!!!!!!! HE DOESNT KNOW ANY BETTER YOU IDIOT!!!!!!! NOT EVERYONE IS A NERD!!!!!!!! 8(
screenjunkies Obama did try which is cool but he failed quite badly. If hes going to venture into using science fiction he should make sure he knows his stuff. He would actually be a lot cooler if he actually watched Star Trek and Star Wars. After his presidency that is. Im sure he has no time to do that as president and spend time with his family. Unless his familys watching that kind of Sci Fi.
screenjunkies If you read the book you should know THAT THE MOVIES CAME FIRST!!!
screenjunkies you do not belong there are ones before you
screenjunkies Thats exactly how he has this country on a mind melt Jedi trick for kids
screenjunkies what, that he has the original DVD release box set that i also have but is now useless cause i obviously got the blueray set? i mean come on it, LotR, gotta have that shit in blueray.. but ya, is that all yer referencing? i dont get why this is a top comment, lol..
screenjunkies So he made a mistake it happens
screenjunkies Srsly that staring thing cracks me up everytime. But really that Skeletor thing sold me.

screenjunkies the climax was all a dream what a rip off lol.
screenjunkies Go home, stares... Youre drunk.
screenjunkies Im laughing so hard right now, whoever made this is a genius
screenjunkies lmao lmao Im crying right now!!!! dude got my lungs starting to hurt lol seriously :) lol starring shovelface, skeletor and snow dogs :) lol this whole thing is super funny, and when he talks about five car commercials and chess playing but hes honest :)
screenjunkies Am I the only one who finds it hilarious when Bella yells at Jacob about nicknaming her daughter Nessie? Why on earth would she be pissed about that?? Vampires are ok but a Loch Ness Monster? OH HELL NAW! :P sheesh
screenjunkies Ghost can kick Jacobs ass
screenjunkies Twilight is so fucking dumb.
screenjunkies Taylor Swift so amazing hahaha
screenjunkies And Kristen Stewart . . . And her inability to use toothpaste Hahaha cant stop laughing
screenjunkies Dude am I the only one who thinks that Kristen is hotter as a vampire
screenjunkies say SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY
screenjunkies I cringed at the amount of tooth paste that missed her toothbrush.
screenjunkies Does anyone know the music used from 2:11 ish, the background music of the stares
screenjunkies Im the same way! Shovelface and mouth breather... I burst out laughing every time I hear it. Awesome.
screenjunkies There is only 1 big problem of the Twilight saga finishing... we wont get any more of these honest trailers
screenjunkies mouth breather and shovel face
screenjunkies Say Thats how the ball bounces G. Please!
screenjunkies Most of the time they just dont speak and stare awkward
screenjunkies How many happen with dialogue? How long?
screenjunkies TWENTY SIX FREAKING MINUTES?!?! XD
screenjunkies No one blinks in this movie!! OO LOL!! XD
screenjunkies so... many... STARES!!!!
screenjunkies Thousands of preteens and lonely mothers wasted 26 minutes of their lives watching people stare at each other.
screenjunkies I did the math. Total run time of all 5 movies is 608 minutes. 24m 37s is 4 of the saga.
screenjunkies This made me feel awkward.
screenjunkies This is the most exciting and actionfilled video on youtube!
screenjunkies They put rober downey jr in this movie???? 24:55 da heck?? OO
screenjunkies We cant think of anything for this scene, just stare for five minutes
screenjunkies Made it to 04:43. I feel like a champ. A disgusting champ.
screenjunkies Whats the song used in the title card and in the staring scenes in honest trailers?
screenjunkies Did I just waste half an hour of my life watching the stares of Twilight? Damit, the realization make me feel how sad my life is!!
screenjunkies OK I get a brownie badge for watching the whole thing.
screenjunkies OK I get a brownie badge for watching the whole thing.
screenjunkies 3 minutes was enough for me...
screenjunkies Omg you guys actually suffered through all these movies to make this vid! Thats what i call a sacrifice for the audience!
screenjunkies And scene! Totally nailed it
screenjunkies I only liked it because it was funny to watch! Like if you watched the entire thing, but suffered through it all!
screenjunkies oh my god I made it just to the first movie lol its hilarious and mostly sad :(
screenjunkies I got past the first movie onto the seocond . why am I doing this im so not going to be able to watch much longer :P lasted 02:15
screenjunkies I cant believe I made it through the whole 26 minutes  there is must be something wrong with me haha :P
screenjunkies 1:13 for me XD couldnt take it any longer :DD
screenjunkies it took me a while to finish the video it ended with me laughing all over the floor with how bad these movies were made yet i still sat my ass and watched every single one of them
screenjunkies OH GOD DOES IT EVER END?!
screenjunkies I love how you wave goodbye
screenjunkies I want Matt Damon to host
screenjunkies Funny that Hal said We want more Ben Affleck, considering the controversy over Batfleck... just interesting.
screenjunkies NPH should just host everything.
screenjunkies Most Awkward award should have gone to Melissa Mcarthy and Paul Dudds jokes. God that sucked.
screenjunkies i cried when you did the australiancockney accent of adelehow can someone be that unfunny?
screenjunkies Barbara Streisand, not Walters.
screenjunkies More Affleck? One word: Batman
screenjunkies This is the most creative thing Ive see by you. Pure genius! Btw, Adele also thanked Mr Bean, Roald Dahl, FrenchSaunders and the congestion Charge. It was a pretentious speech (i still love Adele, Shallow Hal)
screenjunkies I certainly did not watch the Oscars last night...however, I can totally get behind the ScreenJunkies making fun of it all. Good stuff. :)
screenjunkies So John Travolta has mispronounced something for two straight oscars.
screenjunkies 3:08How dare you sir. NO!!!... No... :P
screenjunkies Why werent Paul Rudd  Melissa McCarthy up for Most Awkward Award while presenting Best Animated Film?
screenjunkies I just think that he is not simply hilarious at all. He and his family guy is boring as hell.
screenjunkies Im waiting for the time when he says: Yeah, I look like Peewee Herman.
screenjunkies I know you think you are funny but you actually are not. Accepted it and stop doing these kind of video.
screenjunkies I hate Seth macfarlane
screenjunkies Fuck you ...live with it !
screenjunkies Wait, wait. Did you guys find Teds joke antisemitic but you can make fun of Adeles weight? B.S.
screenjunkies You look just like PeeWee Herman!!!
screenjunkies it would be great if Robert Downey Jr, hosted the Oscars
screenjunkies The best person to host the Oscars is ups Russia
screenjunkies THE LAST AIRBENDER YES
screenjunkies it would be nice to see cyclops and jean resurrected some how, anyway i think the movie may have already screwed up because of the fact ONCE AGAIN the story revolves around wolverine
screenjunkies First class is the best Xmen by far
screenjunkies half of me wants these movies to do well because it sucks when you see characters and stories that you love get butchered. The other half wants 20th century fox and sony to have a series of busts so that... well, you know. I just want everyone in the same universe.
screenjunkies Come on! I like the XMen Origins Wolverine
screenjunkies My favorite XMEN character is Jean GreyThe Phoenix. The movie did a terrible job on her storyline DreamKiller
screenjunkies Heres the thing that bothers me, Wolverine is the lead and main character in this movie. If you know the original comic series of Days of Future Past, you would know that Kitty Pryde aka Shadowcat is the the focus of a majority of the story. Its kind of sexist that she is taking the backseat to Wolverine.
screenjunkies Avengers vs XMen. That was a great story and it could be its own trilogy. Imagine all the fight scenes and how the character from all the movies would interact.
screenjunkies The Marvel street level heroes. Spidey, Daredevil, Iron Fist, Luke Cage, Moon Knight?Black Cat?
screenjunkies Have batman team up with the fantastic 4 and xmen with guest apperances from iron man and thor while going against loki the winter soldier and Magneto to try to take all the elemets from the sun to blow up our galaxy
screenjunkies so are you going to do a Godzilla Trailer?
screenjunkies Star Wars and Star Trek meet that would blow my mind
screenjunkies I really think if the director really wants to make ANY of these movies to work he simply needs to not only watch the entire cartoon series of the Xmen but become passionate about them but also read the comics. They need Bishop and Cable to bring the professor back get Gene under control so they can use the Pheonixs powers, bring in Gambit, Collosses (the older version) Ice Man (older) Wolverine Cyclopes (with there comic suits) Beast and Professor X.
screenjunkies I was just talking about the katana thing this afternoon!what a coincidence!
screenjunkies Deadpool, Cable, Wolverine with the Punisher and Nick Fury.
screenjunkies I agree, i was very upset with the misconduct of Dark Phoenix as just Code Name or alter ego than the Cosmic Force it is.
screenjunkies 6:10 And yet, nothing on Lady Deathstrike and her adamantium nails in X2?
screenjunkies I just want to see Wolverine fight the Hunk to be honest!
screenjunkies I call BS on this whole video
screenjunkies avengers, fantastic 4, and maybe some xmen too. I really want this movie to be good I LOVE xmen and they need redeeming. my nightmare scenario is this: we all know that time travel movies are hard, but xmen comics have a lot of material to work with from time traveling xmen. so it might be easier to figure out the plot, which I really hope they do because time travel plot holes are the WORST.my ultimate fear is that they will put so much time and effort into making the plot and storyline correct and workable that they will forget all the great action and character that goes into a xmen production
screenjunkies They are gonna fuck this up.
screenjunkies okay okay okay....where are the REAL girls from craigslist. the fat ugly and insane ones?
screenjunkies Natalie Portman right?
screenjunkies Are these girls actors?...
screenjunkies And back to the future
screenjunkies This girls are IDIOTS! or really nervous.
screenjunkies I dont want to live on this planet anymore.
screenjunkies Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Edward Cullen, before Edward met Bella. Buffy would stake him, save the day and prevent a horrible, dystopian future from ever happening.
screenjunkies I am a girl and understood every reference immediately, im probably not hot enough to have made it into the video though...
screenjunkies Testing out how classic movie romance plotlines would work in the real world...
screenjunkies I recognized terminator and Star Wars
screenjunkies Come on Hal, you and Haily were cute! Persue that!We want to see you get married in the future!
screenjunkies 1.Dirty Dancing2.Sixteen Candles3.Twilight4.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind(I think?)5.The terminator6.Star wars7.Back to the future
screenjunkies Natalie Portman in Empire Strikes Back!?
screenjunkies That was in fact the moment when I stopped the vid, cause I lost all interest in these girls.
screenjunkies Yay for Eternal Sunshine reference!
screenjunkies Uhhh, I was born in 89 and all I know about Gabriel is hes a singer. Obviously I got nearly every other reference.
screenjunkies When she said the Natalie Portman thing I seriously shrieked. :
screenjunkies how come that so, did she blow you? comment is not in the top
screenjunkies Could you have picked up worse women than these?
screenjunkies those girls are fucking stupid, how could one of them not get the star wars reference right away?
screenjunkies You absolutely have no taste in movies arsehole! I just fucking unsubscribed, get a new host not an arse!
screenjunkies Iron man 3 is the best
screenjunkies Bane blows up the field
screenjunkies Best halftime show would be directed by JJ Abrams  who cares who is performing....he would reboot it!
screenjunkies Benedict Cumberbatch!!!
screenjunkies Did this asshole say vin diesel was a piece of shit?
screenjunkies he obviously never saw Pitch Black.  wasnt the Rock in the Tooth Fairy ???? the Rock is a pussy compared to Riddick !!!!
screenjunkies naaa spongebob has the most epic half time show,,
screenjunkies Chuck norris standing in the middle of the field
screenjunkies Do 2012 honest trailer
screenjunkies Best Half time show already exists. Its the Kitten Half Time Show for the Puppy Bowl.
screenjunkies Dmx singing party up with weir al. Also weird al is singing eat it.
screenjunkies Best half time show recreate the spongebob half time show (sweet victory) with a guest appearence of morgan freeman
screenjunkies Tu pac hologram halftime show
screenjunkies Half Time show  William Shatner doing a Benny Hill type performance with all the cheerleaders.. :)
screenjunkies How did I miss this episode? I have no idea. Luckily they had a link on their new Honest Trailer.
screenjunkies Best Super Bowl halftime would be watching Adam Sandler dress up like ghost rider while the rock and Liam Neeson try and stop him.
screenjunkies The ultimate stare off between Kristen Stewart and Keanu Reeves...
screenjunkies Superbowl1 Champions league groupe stage game between two teams from eastern europe
screenjunkies Oh Europe  Just let us have our sport.
screenjunkies Half Time show  William Shatner doing a Benny Hill type performance with all the cheerleaders.. :)
screenjunkies How did I miss this episode? I have no idea. Luckily they had a link on their new Honest Trailer.
screenjunkies Most epic halftime show Benedict Cumberbatch summing up random people in the audience like in Sherlock.
screenjunkies Do Breaking Dawn Parts 1 and 2!!!!
screenjunkies Best half time show: The Avengers reenact Magic Mike. ScarJo will play Mike.
screenjunkies david attenborough or morgan freeman walks out and just narrates everything that happens or that he sees
screenjunkies liam neeson and morgan freeman rap battle.
screenjunkies HOLY FUUUCK. That Robin chick was on that Conan Goes to a Halloween Store video. She seems so funny and CHARMing. Robin I know youre reading this, Im so in love with you
screenjunkies on 1:04, the blonde one says in greek Please Hermes,give me a parking spot,keep it empty so i can use it. its not a spell,greeks say that every minute replacing Hermes with Fucking God
screenjunkies witches my a, but i would let em polish my firebolt... ok not the one on the right.
screenjunkies I AM a witch! and black. how come they found the stupidest fucking witches possible to answer the dumbest questions ever? im sooooo pissed.
screenjunkies is it just me or were the other witches embarrassed of the one in the middle?
screenjunkies i have a clan of werewolfs and am in iintrested in the help of witches above level 12 to buff us when we go on hunts we also have a level 10 clown specced in baloon magic. a lvl 15 shiteater specced dihare and a lvl 11 catholic priest who just seem to like children a lot
screenjunkies he was being such a douche
screenjunkies at 3:40, she had to think about her answer and she looked away from him while answering. Conclusion: she eats children.
screenjunkies There are no witches in this, just an idiot interviewing a dopey ginger and two hambeasts
screenjunkies The guy interviewing them is such a tool.
screenjunkies FYI: If you want a Schindlers List of paganism try The Burning Times Trilogy. It shows actual history about how people who believed in pantheism were systematically murdered. And even folks who didnt were killed. Over a 400 year time span 100s of thousands of people were burned at the stake. Women, Children, Men. The fact that youre willing to list Jesus as a fairytale monster saves this program totally. Thats awesome. I want to be clear that I like Screen Junkies, I just want the public to respect that other faiths are valid too.
screenjunkies I was waiting for him to bring up Harry Potter.
screenjunkies Ive never laughed so hard at a youtube video in my life.
screenjunkies wtf the parking spell she just tells in Greek and not ancient Greek or latin normal new Greek : god pls give me a parking spot
screenjunkies The reason witches are made to look evil is because we have a horned god who somehow they connect with the devil and the casting of spells that they somehow connect with the devil, even though WE DONT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE DEVIL! I think there is a huge ignorance to the whole witch thing being bad and stuff, we are made to look ugly and evil .....like really? Wicca (no exactly the same thing) is also picked on like that (some do practice magic), we are a religion however small just cuz we dont go to church and have a set standard doesnt make us any less of a religion and I dont like the way we are portrayed.
screenjunkies Omfg, lost my Shit. Fucking idiots!!!
screenjunkies So apparently, anyone living in Greece is speaking in a language used to conjure magic.What the fuck?
screenjunkies What. Is. Wrong. With. These. Idiots.How does that even portray modern day witches poorly when its a fictional movie based on a fairy tale? If it was set in 2014, then id get it, a little.
screenjunkies unrealistic . . .Skanks with rotting bodies flying on broom sticks, gizmos and gadgets that never existed in any century, and a troll the size of Dwayne Johnson. Somehow I dont think they were going for realism. XD And for all the real life version of witches that exist, there is OBVIOUSLY the fictional, fairytale version that gets used by Hollywood.
screenjunkies Quick question: what the fuck is a real witch?
screenjunkies Im actually not sure if this is real or a joke.Im kind of scared now.
screenjunkies DUPSTEP KILLS ZOMBIES
screenjunkies Harsh language is my favorite weapon against zombies.
screenjunkies I dont like rob Corday
screenjunkies The best way to kill an zombie is to show them twilight
screenjunkies i really laughed at this !!!!
screenjunkies The romantic zombie comedy Warm Bodies devoured the box office competition this weekend
screenjunkies this is hilarious! Love some Rob Corddry

screenjunkies Always with m134 mini gun or AA 12 or SW 500 MAGNUM. or if not ketana to the head chain saw works too spiki bassboll bat nail dynemit.
screenjunkies put the zombie inside a huge microwave
screenjunkies Best way to kill a zombie is to drop a paino on its head. Old school but effective.
screenjunkies Did he just say The Walking Dead was bullshit I am going to kill him
screenjunkies Most effective way to kill zombie: punch to bladder.
screenjunkies The best way to kill a zombie is to get its attention so its limping towards you, run up duck down cut the legs off so its crawling around... And then make it come towards you again and stab its head.... Unless its R... :)
screenjunkies Bear hug them from behind. 3
screenjunkies Walking dead is not bullshit it is actuly it is more realistic
screenjunkies I would show the zombie your video. It would die from boringness
screenjunkies Strap them down and make them listen to jb
screenjunkies Funniest thing Ive watched in a long time.
screenjunkies BANE GAY KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK rachei aki cara
screenjunkies Twilight action figures... very offensive
screenjunkies Im surprised nobody said that action figures and toys are aimed at kids... What sort of parent lets their kid watch Django? Anyway I dont think its offensive to make action figures out of anything as long as theyre responsible about its marketing
screenjunkies Shawshank Redemption limited edition shiv
screenjunkies Recreate all your favourite tragic true death scenes with the official Band of Brothers playset!
screenjunkies Screen Junkies with a street Junkie. lol.
screenjunkies how about a John Mccain presidential action figure?
screenjunkies Woody Harrelson action figure from Natural Born Killers.
screenjunkies Well... technically all the Spawn action figures also picture a black guy :P
screenjunkies Do, Escape From, shit wrong show.
screenjunkies As a comic book fan, I am more offended by The Big Bang Theory than Django Unchained.
screenjunkies passion of christ...cross and nails sold separately
screenjunkies do the joker voice!!!
screenjunkies the birth of a nation, sorry... but he asked
screenjunkies Nailed it with human centipede, but I think the movie teeth would be the worst...
screenjunkies SAW traps for your barbie dolls,book on how to talk to teen by Cersie Lannister and cook book by Hannibal Lecter :D
screenjunkies Titanic action figures complete with their own sinking ship. lol
screenjunkies Id buy a Human Centipede action figure. How could I resist?
screenjunkies legende a do filme do skyfall
screenjunkies kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk show, parabens pela legenda
screenjunkies hahaha tima legenda (continue assim cara)
screenjunkies Legenda Batman DKR please!
screenjunkies The Amazing SpiderMan was great! Better than 2002s! Except we didnt need the retold origin.
screenjunkies So many people say that the Amazing SpiderMan film was so much better than the first Spidey film. I was one of them for the longest time, but as the hype kinda wears off, I can easily say that both films were better than each other in certain aspects. Both were great in their own ways. SpiderMan had a more compelling villain. The Amazing SpiderMan had better supporting characters (besides Aunt May). Both did great jobs with Uncle Ben. SpiderMan was a more rewatchable movie (Probably due to its lighthearted nature). The Amazing SpiderMan had a better Peter Parker and SpiderMan as a whole. The Amazing SpiderMan had a much better New Yorkers help out Spidey scene (Crane operator with a debt to Spidey aids in quick travel for injured hero vs. random NY citizens with preplanned speeches for Goblin and cars full of rotten food and misc. junk to throw while Spidey saves perpetually screaming redhead and kids). SpiderMan had a more memorable music score (The strings and percussion played in a way that totally gave the score a creepy spider movement vibe, whereas I hardly remember TASM score and I watched it for the 15th time, yesterday). Its really hard to be subjective because I grew up on SpiderMan cartoons, so I fell in love with the first two Spidey movies. Heck, my first comic was a SpiderMan comic. But we have to face the reality that neither of the two franchises are perfect, but they have their moments. I really hope that Marvel doesnt get the movie rights for Spidey back for a while, because we all know what theyd do with him (see Ultimate SpiderMan cartoon on Disney Channel). Id like to grow old and die before I ever see Spidey ruined like that on the big screen!
screenjunkies I highly disagree about Milla Jovovich. Maybe the movie was bad, but Milla plays her role as Alice really really good. The plot holes and goofs about her character arent her fault. She made the best out of it.
screenjunkies Adam sandler needs to cut the shit with this half assed comedies that he keeps pumping out. I would like to see him do more serious rolls.
screenjunkies Was dissappointed with this episode guys ..sorry!...I was waiting for SANTA to lean across the table and make NICK the NEW SANTA!! ..He touches NICKS chubby little finger ..THEN....(cue sparkles!.. stars and mystical whirlwinds!..) .........TA DAH!!....NICK would have looked down at his new red costume..and said....:OH!..MY!...GOD!....I LOOK SO FKN AWESOME!!!!......AND ex santa SAYS .. OK...Now that thats over with!...SHOW ME MORE shit movies!!...
screenjunkies Cloud Atlas was a class film if youre intelligent enough to actually concentrate and appreciate the structures of the story.
screenjunkies I thought Battleship was pretty good
screenjunkies Look at all these white guys hating on madea..
screenjunkies Amazing SpiderMan was dope
screenjunkies Most of the stuff I heard in this video is a load of rubbish lol
screenjunkies Is everyone forgetting the chick from dark knight rises? Worst death scene ever! Guess they already hit their budget for the movie so they couldnt replace her since she was doing so well up until that point and just said f it, cut, and print it. Guess they thought she would take away from all the other mistakes and unexplainable scenarios in the movie. Well guessed wrong, just made the list longer.
screenjunkies Good stuff. You are awesome Hal, lets be best friends.
screenjunkies Every unknown actor from the last airbender
screenjunkies worst picture: Gravity
screenjunkies Why does everyone hate on Tyler perry so much. I think made a is funny as hell I get maybe its cheap humor but hes still crazy funny. :)
screenjunkies wtf is with the fake hand
screenjunkies How to fix die hard 5..... Stop making the Fucking movies
screenjunkies JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE HARD
screenjunkies Die hard 1,2 and 4 were the best out of the whole films.
screenjunkies .. um what a weird fake hand.. you shoulda atleast done something with it.. like something neat.. instead of just having a fake hand for no reason at all
screenjunkies JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE HARD
screenjunkies Its actually Spartacus:Blood and Sand and Jai Courtnetys Character Varro was one of the best on the show his friendship with Spartacus was brilliant! (Watch it Guys)
screenjunkies John Tucker Must Die Hard
screenjunkies They should do a Die Hard version of Last Action Hero, its 2020 and a the last die hard movie is made, Die Hard 12, and its terrible. all cgi crap, including a cgi Bruce Willis. Then a kid goes to see it and magicly falls into the movie and teaches John mclane about his roots, and how Die Hard should be, slowly the movie turns to be good, and the cgi bruce turns into a real bruce. STUPID I KNOW! But it would be so funny, and who knows, might be good!
screenjunkies Nick Mundy is awesome
screenjunkies Grow your hair out!!!
screenjunkies the die hard movies are begining to die hard
screenjunkies It should be called Die Hard of Natural Causes.
screenjunkies y does he have a fake arm?
screenjunkies That guy has some decent points but I think he is putting on an act to try and seem really outraged. And to be blunt, he is not that good of an actor. Sorry, and Im not trying to be a troll or mean etc. To steal a phrase Im just show him how to fix this video
screenjunkies More Nick Munday, hes awesome.
screenjunkies 4:32  Fake arm?? Funny, cuz if you go to google and search hal rudnick fake arm video this one pops up... at least for me
screenjunkies I think I found an easter egg....
screenjunkies There will be no Die Hard 6, the last film destroyed the franchise.
screenjunkies Die Hard 6: Die Harder Die Hard 7: Die Even Harder than That Die Hard 8: Die Much Harder
screenjunkies I dont have doubt that Die Hard 5 have the same background of Silent Hill 4. Hey we can change the name of the characters and call it Die Hard, will sell more.
screenjunkies What the fuck??!! Is he peeing fire at 2:13?!
screenjunkies The Christopher Nolan award should go to World War Z, for the most obligatory use of that sound
screenjunkies Well, they were sure wrong about the Andy Samberg part.
screenjunkies I hate anna Kendricks face why cant anyone agree with me?
screenjunkies Vyhlaovn cen by Screen Junkies
screenjunkies and it was pretty funny when data got his head ripped off
screenjunkies Umm the Grey sucked, anyone who liked it is an idiot
screenjunkies That In memoriam song was awesome! hilarious!
screenjunkies i totally agree on Anna Kendrick, she grows on you and you get really horny.
screenjunkies Well, maybe I like this kind of film (and I saw it three times) so I pretty much got it andor found a reason to explain things. The guy turned into a zombie cause of the black gooacid combo that changed his biological makeup.
screenjunkies haha! caught Hal off guard  0:07. love Screenjunkies btw
screenjunkies Nope. I just watched the movie
screenjunkies Totally agree with you on 1.  Battleship was just as stupid at Transformers, but since it didnt have the same title, it bombed. I really liked Prometheus.
screenjunkies Aside from HBOs Luck, which I havent seen, I dont agree with any of your statements.
screenjunkies i want your Ghostbusters stuff !!!!!!
screenjunkies John Travoltas dignity . . . amen to that.
screenjunkies oh cmon, prometheus wasnt THAT bad.....
screenjunkies Ya I gotta agree I thought the last of it left a long time ago... you know after Battlefield Earth
screenjunkies Movies rarely  if ever  live up to their trailershype. Which is basically the point: Con the public into seeing your film. Screen Junkies HONEST TRAILERS vids are based upon this premise.
screenjunkies i would totally do anna kendrick
screenjunkies This guy reminds me of Kevin Sussman
screenjunkies travolta lost his dignity years ago hairspray.
screenjunkies Oh! I get it! Battlefield Earth right.
screenjunkies People say the same about Cloud Atlas, but I totally got that film too.
screenjunkies Promethius was a great movie, but definitely not very easy my friend. Ridley has even stated that he wont review the secrets from it. And why the fuck did that one dude turn into a crazy ass zombie!
screenjunkies Say faith,trust and pixie dust
screenjunkies Say Say hello to my little friend
screenjunkies eu vi o conto de um hobbit e  praticamente mesma coisa um saco

screenjunkies Pobre Sean Bean! huahhahahua
screenjunkies Morri na parte de Guynet Paltrow kkkkkk
screenjunkies eles deveriam fazer sobre o filme de Percy Jackson, no tem nenhum filme mais facil de zuar.
screenjunkies Deus amado, so tantos pontos abertos que me impressiono como ns, pblico, no percebemos. Ficou hilrio, e tima legenda.
screenjunkies intao se for pra procurar defeitos, vamos procurar os defeitos de alguns dos melhores filmes da historia, como Titanic e The Godfather...voce vai achar erros MUITO mais grotescos que esses ai do Batman, e mesmo assim esses filmes nao deixam de ser alguns dos melhores de todos os tempos...
screenjunkies Os erros de Titanic e The Godfather em geral so erros que tem a ver com filmagem e questes de ambientao. Os erros de The Dark Knight Rises so furos de roteiro. E furos de roteiro so menos perdoveis do que erros de ambientao e filmagem. Principalmente vindos da mesma equipe que fez obras primas como Amnsia.
screenjunkies kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.. quem assistiu Looper vai entender o Bruce Wilis
screenjunkies Cara, ningum t reclamando do filme. Isso  humor!
screenjunkies Best movie interview ever?
screenjunkies Can you please do The Cabin in the Woods trailer? :)
screenjunkies James woods picard Forest whitakerlaforge Kevin bacondata Djimon Hounsouworf Jeff Bridgesriker Drew BarrymoreBeverly Kyle GallnerWesley
screenjunkies Jesus was never meant to be funny.
screenjunkies with the current state of the film industry the entire cast might be Nicholas Cage and Tyler Perry. God help us all.
screenjunkies Please do inception!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies I love how Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann both had very different reactions to the waxing.
screenjunkies Those three are the best.
screenjunkies Dude you are hilarious.
screenjunkies TNG with: Shakira as Deanna Troi (no one understands her anyway) Jim Parsons as Wesley Crusher (he can play a genius and irony never fails with fans) Helen Keller as La Forge (it just makes sense) Nicholas Cages Forhead as Worf The Situation as Riker (Why not?) James McAvoy as Picard (RIGHTFULLY SO) Kate Walsh as Bev Crusher (she knows how to play a doctor and her career is going nowhere anyways) AAAND...... Jennifer Lawrence as Data for her robotic deliveries
screenjunkies i want a tee shirt maaaan
screenjunkies I left a comment. Now do I get a shirt?
screenjunkies What a fantastic interview. You might have noticed how the three of them started off cold and a little annoyed. Most people get bored at press junkets very quickly. But through Rudnicks silly questions and antics you see the three celebrities let their guard down. While drinking and being goofy they reveal much more about themselves than they would have through answering a typical questionnaire. Well done screenjunkies.
screenjunkies True. I can wash, but Ill never be clean.
screenjunkies Well my favorite part was the one hour sequence where Bilbo packs his clothes for the journey.
screenjunkies PLEASE DO INCEPTION!!!!!!
screenjunkies This is my 3rd time watching this  I just noticed the toy in your pocket. Hahaha
screenjunkies Amazing, Amazing! Interview!
screenjunkies How do you know youre not getting reeled in by this girl?Because I already fuked her. XDWhat power would you like?The power of flight.Why?So I can take girls up into the sky. And if they dont fuk. They dont come down.Oh god, I cant look at Superman the same again.
screenjunkies Haha fucking creepy cunt
screenjunkies This came out the same day as Sandy Hook. Rest in Peace Sandy Hook kids. (Please, Hal, read this for those kids)
screenjunkies This movie is badass. Everyone go see it now!
screenjunkies ace venture pet detective
screenjunkies They should make a movie about Tim Burton and have Johnny Depp play Helena Bonham Carter.
screenjunkies At this point in his career I think Johnny depp would have a hard time playing Johnny depp
screenjunkies The Grinch, he talks too drunkly
screenjunkies Johnny Depp couldnt do Edward from Twilight because Edward has to be a Pssy.
screenjunkies hell i would fuck superman and im not even gay.
screenjunkies hell i would fuck superman and im not even gay.
screenjunkies What would Superman having phone sex sound like? I laughed for five minutes
screenjunkies Johnny depp could not play the role of any of the women from the hobbit.
screenjunkies Super man is definitely way different than that one dude.
screenjunkies That got inappropriate really fast. Who knew superman was such a dirty old man
screenjunkies Johnny Depp could never play Michael Clarke Duncans role as John Coffey from The Green Mile.
screenjunkies It was all fine and dandy till 2:25. This is kinda disturbing, was he serious?....I would have left as soon, as soon as this guy got weird, not about that lyfe.
screenjunkies so I thought I was watching a video about the hollywood Superman, and then it turned into two creepy dudes watching nudes
screenjunkies A role he couldnt play? I dont know... Willy Wonka?
screenjunkies Johnny Depp couldnt play Edward Cullen.
screenjunkies why did u even ask?? of course he couldnt play Mr. Chow from the Hangover. Im asian and I dont think i can even pull that off!!
screenjunkies lol, this superman is a giant pervert. Its like Patrick Stewart in Extras.
screenjunkies Anybody who played The Joker before him. :I
screenjunkies he couldnt play the role of a tayolr loffner from twilight
screenjunkies This was funny as hell
screenjunkies Ok you can kill us now:(
screenjunkies Another funny Jewish holiday movie is Hebrew Hammer. Of course it was just a comedy central original movie but it was okay. As for why Superman is being arrested, because his movie sucks?
screenjunkies Im a jew and this guy is also jewish
screenjunkies Santa messed up every year........
screenjunkies daniel its a good army but I think its ranked 13th in the world so I dont know about one of the strongest. I kinda wish this movie was real. I would see it
screenjunkies how the Grinch stole hanukka
screenjunkies are we ever finished with these bullsht stereotypes?
screenjunkies 2:12 actually in my country the y have bacon but it is not made out of pork
screenjunkies Lol thats awesome and I would see it.
screenjunkies i would be jewish if i can eat bacon
screenjunkies Hilarious, you should make this!!!!
screenjunkies If Jews have all the money, then why ask for money? LOL
screenjunkies They arrested Superman for funding another M. Night Shyamalan film. :P
screenjunkies He obviously got arrested for vandalism after the bullets they shot at him destroyed a wall
screenjunkies They arrested Superman for being an illegal alien
screenjunkies Somehow I think youll keep responding. As a Hasbarat its your job! Shit I wish my job was so amusing. Orangeman? Youve got me all wrong. I identify with White people before we were ever corrupted by that alien religion from the Middle East called Christianity. You are using the Algiz rune. To say youre a Catholic is laughable. You freaks are all mixedup. Keep trying to blend in though as it is quite funny.
screenjunkies Never thought of that. Where IS his green card?
screenjunkies The sandwich making breaks so many jewish rules for eating kosher.
screenjunkies also, since when do trolls have such perfect grammar? Im dazzled
screenjunkies Sou super f de Jogos Vorazes, algumas coisas eles exageraram mas eu preferi levar tudo na brincadeira do que levar a srio, ento eu ri muitoooo!! Very Fun
screenjunkies Do fenomeno jovem adulto que no  sobre vampiros gays kkkkkk morri de rir
screenjunkies no curti, achei ofensivo
screenjunkies Sem essas partes importantes do livro: haha concordei na hora, eu queria ver essas cenas no filme mas no tem pena
screenjunkies Hilrio. S no concordei com o fato de acharem que a Jen no passou emoo como Katniss. Mas, opinio  opinio. Curti!
screenjunkies Achei bastante engraada a parodia e realmente concordo com a parte de faltar cenas importantes do livro, tipo mostrava pelo menos os dos Avoxes, quer dizer eles so de certa forma importantes para a historia.
screenjunkies Bom, acho que alguns no entenderam The Hunger Games :
screenjunkies Dat little Yoshi plushie strapped to the guy in the Mario costume. XDAlso I rofled when the Stormtroopers always miss. came up.
screenjunkies You missed your chance to use the quote run you fools.
screenjunkies OH! Ed from Cowboy Bebop lol hurray. Itd be so awesome if you guys would do an Honest Trailer about an anime.
screenjunkies Fantasy Fantasy Football. Looks like fun. I think the Power Play rule makes this.
screenjunkies black mario,twenty sided die? this is epic.
screenjunkies I was expecting football but then you play something which definitely isnt football. Football is a sport where feet actually touch the ball, hence the name.
screenjunkies Was the person in the big pink dress a crossdressing Ciel Phantomhive cosplay?
screenjunkies Classic Nick Fury.. lol...But I love Sam
screenjunkies I want to put babies in that Radical Edward cosplayer. Rawr!
screenjunkies i came here for lightning
screenjunkies This is actually funny though. Loved all the references XD
screenjunkies Adding this to my bucket list.
screenjunkies the coaches power is homosexuality
screenjunkies Ciel and Lightning!!3
screenjunkies Lightning, y u no switch paradigm?
screenjunkies thats not football, thats handegg
screenjunkies How was chick axel supposed to catch the ball?
screenjunkies 2:09 Darth Nihilus in the background?
screenjunkies I almost didnt watch this because I cant stand football but this was fantastic
screenjunkies I am just so happy to see Ed playing. Cowboy Bebop is just awesome.
screenjunkies Kinda surprised Dumbledore lost it for them. He could have summoned up his phoenix and flown the ball over to the endzone just saying lol
screenjunkies BABBA BOOEY! Where are you guys located?
screenjunkies No, we dont love you.Its actually pretty arrogant to think you know what other people think.
screenjunkies why does everyone give hal shit ?? he makes the screen junkies show what it is
screenjunkies This guy is the beat guy ever!!!!!!
screenjunkies Hal seems like such a nice guy. Id feel bad if I left an angry comment. Its the Internet and I would feel bad. Thats how much I like you Hal. You greedy Jewish bastard with odd charisma that slowly grows on you like mold or some type of fungal infection.
screenjunkies ok hal rudnik does a nice job and i like the way he says bye at the end.
screenjunkies These cant go any furher.
screenjunkies that guy was on community.
screenjunkies Why??? Why did you have to show us that dog thing?? Why????
screenjunkies Gas I dont have a sense of humour then..... I feel like a holocaust. :(
screenjunkies Well, I for one think people should stop acknowledging negative comments altogether, let alone making videos dedicated to them in exchange of some quick cash, because that only makes it worse.
screenjunkies Please keep telling people how to run their youtube channels, its not like they should be in charge of it because they make all the content or anything... jesus people are lazy and entitled these days.
screenjunkies What are with these mean jokes? They are like blind jokes, I just dont see the point...
screenjunkies Because a guy with 69 in his name said so.
screenjunkies Those people are assholes. Hal is hilarious.
screenjunkies Thats funny, youre a funny guy...you know...the way you tell the story...what?
screenjunkies That Rudy dude is one cool guy. His arms arent hairy.
screenjunkies I love this channel !
screenjunkies 5:09...no, sweetie. Just...no, dont do that
screenjunkies Disliked for happy ending.
screenjunkies I do not want to have future daughters like them...I cant even deal with my friends fangirl over 1D.
screenjunkies These American kids are so annoying! I already want to kill them.
screenjunkies Some kids just...why do we raise children on such fucking schlock?
screenjunkies actors from twilight helping ask questions for this video that is kinda making fun of twilight? lol
screenjunkies Its always pretty hilarious when super and I mean SUPER fans of something assume that only ignorant fools dont know what they view as common knowledge. No being malicious here REALLY but I legit laugh. I mean if I asked them questions about my MOST GLORIOUS hobby and infinite bottomless pit of time consumption Warhammer 40k, how much would they know? What are 3 methods of highlighting a model? What material should a detail brush be made of? Difference between gloss and matt varnish.EDIT: They are die hard fans yet one apparently doesnt even know their REALLY recent franchises start date. My god.
screenjunkies And that is the story of why Sarah was brutally murdered that night.
screenjunkies Say: I want a sht! (Really loud)
screenjunkies That Kirk guy mustve been really mad knowing all that succesful guessing did nothkng in the end...
screenjunkies Whoever names there kid renesme I will punch them in the face
screenjunkies 0:37 Twilight is my hands down my favorite movie everHer grammar is just as bad as her taste in movies.
screenjunkies The Part Where They said hes so hot just made me gag, and when the 11 year old said that twilight was her favorite movie hands down, just killed me!!! That movie is so stupid! Sorry fans!
screenjunkies I dont like twilight but i did hope for a happy ending and i got it :)
screenjunkies Twilight is stupid... Im a girl
screenjunkies Fell sorry for the dads.
screenjunkies I came here to see teenager tears full of grief, not freaking joy tears... dam im so lonly tonight
screenjunkies I always say it is a must to dislike any twilight video even though they are from ur favorite YouTuber UNLESS their making fun of it
screenjunkies That sounds more like the public schooling system...
screenjunkies The Walking Dead  every time a walker is killed xD
screenjunkies 1:34 that was so cute
screenjunkies What kind of audition is this? lmao
screenjunkies Luke dont kiss the girl! Its your sister!
screenjunkies Funny. Thought Sebastian was great.Starwars Jennifer Larregui Joanna Santiago
screenjunkies Check out Snow White attempting to wear the Slave Leia outfit the Disney Star Wars Auditions.disneystarwars
screenjunkies What do you think the upcoming Disneyproduced Star Wars is going to look like?
screenjunkies Damn, I wanted to see Snow white in the slave leia outfit.
screenjunkies sebastian as palpatine. FUCK YES
screenjunkies star wars rips are getting old...
screenjunkies MICKY: And I slaughtered them like animals! God, I died laughing.
screenjunkies Game of throne. You do a shot every time they say winter is coming, white walkers, a House saying or every time Geofrey pisses you off.
screenjunkies wait but mickey is yoda. just look at him move in kingdom hearts
screenjunkies I would pay to watch All 6 Star Wars films as portrayed by Disney characters.
screenjunkies true blood drink everytime you think it is stupid
screenjunkies Sebastian and eore the Best
screenjunkies I like the way youre thinking. I wonder if we can find the actors imdb or something.
screenjunkies in walking dead everytime a gun is shot by the slide doesnt go back...wait....ya you would probably die of alcohol poisoning.
screenjunkies Darth Vader is Lukes father?!?!?!?! SPOILER ALERT!
screenjunkies am very disapointed no yoda auditions? shame on you shame
screenjunkies wasted 5 min of my life
screenjunkies Im with ryanrightnow, without honest trailers you would be homeless. Or just have a different job.
screenjunkies That was not a prank.That was........ummm...........boring.
screenjunkies That wasnt a prank.That was you being dicks.
screenjunkies Sorry SJ, this just wasnt good. These guys werent funny at all. Even their Jedi impressions sucked.
screenjunkies You can feel the cringe.
screenjunkies You will vote for Mitt Romney.... Hilarious!
screenjunkies its actually so cringy that its funny p
screenjunkies Hahahah this is the best.
screenjunkies not funny at all,lame lame lame!
screenjunkies say you can replace your liver with iron man
screenjunkies The host is a bitch! He pissed off al of those people and thought it was funny?! These are really the people who make honest trailers?!
screenjunkies That was fucking hilarious!
screenjunkies Pranks are supposed to be funny not piss everybody off... douchbags, lame.
screenjunkies That was fucking hilarious!
screenjunkies That shirtless guy with the guitar is hot xD
screenjunkies This is... the exact opposite of funny, Just two assholes in robes?
screenjunkies No. fucking with random people is annoying. you can prank people and not annoy or piss them off. this is bottom of the barrel.
screenjunkies This was the most retarded thing ever. Not cool
screenjunkies People need to get a sense of humor
screenjunkies Straight up bothering people who dont want to be bothered is not funny
screenjunkies No idea how this video ended up with humorless subscribers. This is pretty funny. I mean its really stupid, but the reaction from the people makes it pretty funny. Fking with randoms is funny.
screenjunkies Well its a dog and theres a plane...
screenjunkies Its ironic that this youtube video was relatively a waste of time
screenjunkies orbs lol cough cough try the reflection from the candles lol the noise who knows
screenjunkies The Incredible Hulk just called me an ass. Haha, really funny!
screenjunkies ...::out of nowhere::....Beetlejuice..lmao
screenjunkies Theyre yelling,Hal, youre an ass!
screenjunkies whos the previous person who needed to point out it wasnt real IT WAS JOKE laughing at all the 100s of hours of ghost hunting footage that catches nothing but make hour shows
screenjunkies He didnt mean anything mean,hes just an idiot. xD That made my day!
screenjunkies Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice......
screenjunkies Now when you say no darks does that mean spirits of black people are gonna come?
screenjunkies Lol that MJ lookalike was really creepy and had a really really giant nose.
screenjunkies its funny that you conjured Bill Bixby, considering in the 1976 he played a spiritualist, in The Great Houdini, that was getting a message from Harry Houdini to give to his wife Bess Houdini.
screenjunkies no dark spirits like hitler? all people are a mix of good and evil... what a stupid thing to say
screenjunkies uh dog and plane or SANTA lololol XD
screenjunkies Ah, come on, I like how he is an ignorant asshole while looking actually interested in what people do and talk...
screenjunkies eddie is super creepy
screenjunkies This guy is trying too hard to be funny. Stick to Honest Trailers.
screenjunkies oh man that kid is going to be a nightmare when her 15 mins is up.
screenjunkies OMG fat sassy southerners. Whatever shall we do??
screenjunkies Were everyday people. Thats actually scarier.
screenjunkies man, making them read seemed kind of cruel
screenjunkies Honey Boo Boo  her mom respond to Christopher Walken  colleagues reenacting scenes from their show.This is, uh, I dont know what, but its worth watching.
screenjunkies omg, IT can read honeyPOOPOO
screenjunkies Listning to this made me lose 40 IQ points
screenjunkies alana looks like glitsy
screenjunkies 1:12 seeing Jabba the Hutt and her idiotic sugar fueled imbecile of a daughter make a fool out of herself on national television isnt exactly what you would call everyday people.
screenjunkies As a Walken fan, I found this to be a disgrace to Christopher Walken.
screenjunkies Honey boo boo is so fat
screenjunkies Honey boo boo is so weird
screenjunkies That child pisses me off
screenjunkies Its a shame we allow people like that to breed.
screenjunkies Fucking pigs. Disgraces to humanity.
screenjunkies Canada gave us justin bieber. We gave them honey booboo
screenjunkies She said she never seen any material of Christopher Walken ? Good job on living under a rock for last 30 years,
screenjunkies Id prefer it if they stuck to Walken reading other peoples lines, not the other way around.
screenjunkies its people like these that made them WANT to 911 us
screenjunkies Nod, I absolutely had to quit TV though. It made me FEEL stupid to watch commercials. Physically. Ever since switching to Netflix I feel a lot better about things in general and I dont feel the need to buy everything. I really want Game of Thrones on Net though. I keep hearing how awesome it is. Maybe Ill read the books to hold me up.
screenjunkies I LOVE SEVEN PSYCHPATHS Congrats on coming up with the odd idea of having Christopher, Colin, and Sam read Honey Boo Boo..how cool and weird.
screenjunkies This is pretty funny!
screenjunkies Christopher Walken Vajiggles. Enough said.http:youtu.beNzIsz3fU9xQ
screenjunkies i love christopher walken. ever since i saw Deer Hunter. swoon
screenjunkies Of course we all know who Colin Farrell is! He is the infamous More Cowbell Guy from SNL! Glad to see that he is working with Walken again.
screenjunkies uhh, best interview all DECADE!
screenjunkies You need to check your comments as youve already responded to me on this one a couple of weeks ago. I responded to your other response. Cheers.
screenjunkies Al Pacino and Robert De Niro
screenjunkies WALKIE WALK BEAR. Omgsh thats so adorable X.
screenjunkies RESPECT for being able to eat that piece of shit
screenjunkies One day I heard somebody say Honey Boo Boo is the next Madonna. So then I said No, Honey Boo Boo is the next Zach Galiafanakis... but not as funny.
screenjunkies tanta emoo que o corao de todo mundo bate ao mesmo tempo kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies Esse bilogo do filme fez curso com o Richard Rasmussen, aquele cara que deixa a cobra picar ele s para mostrar que ela  perigosa... E  por causa de caras como esse que algumas pessoas ficam pensando que todo bilogo  retardado mental de se colocar em situaes perigosas.
screenjunkies Aeee Brasil foi representado com o hello Jovem Nerd

screenjunkies Anotado! Valeu pela dica! D
screenjunkies Sua traduo para State of the art in computer maps, eta correta O estado da arte em mapas computadorizados O cara ali de cima que te corrigiu no deve conhecer a expresso que significa o que ha de melhor em alguma coisa.
screenjunkies HELLO JOVEM NERD KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
screenjunkies hahahahahhahahahaHonest Trailers  The Avengers LEGENDADO PTBR!
screenjunkies No importa, aquela cena foi incrivel kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk rachei demais vi kkkkkkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies Bane Gay  KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
screenjunkies como assim fingem conhecer?
screenjunkies na boa, avenger foi um lixo de filme
screenjunkies A cota de super heris do mesmo filme para o Quarteto Fantstico foi preenchida pelo Tocha Amrica
screenjunkies a viuva negra e o arqueiro verde usa fone de ouvido sim , mais o capitao america  tenso heuaheuaheuaeuaehaueuah
screenjunkies Muito bom, rachei aqui. Mas acho que no Hulk deveria ter colocado Eric Bana mesmo, que comeou a nova srie de filmes do Hulk. E foi bem.
screenjunkies Cara voc pode ir legendando todos os trailers do Honest Trailers que vai ficar muito bom , as legendas ficaram legais , bom video !
screenjunkies mace windu foi o mlhor. kkkkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies Acho que iria trazer muita gente pro canal com o Honest Trailer! xD
screenjunkies mas aquele  thanos todo mundo sabe disso...no ?
screenjunkies Que isso, adoro o Capito Amrica!
screenjunkies a parte do hulk controlar aconteceu por que ele segurou aquele basto la durante a briga entre os avengers
screenjunkies O hulk pode controla sua raiva por que o banner se transformou e no foi obrigado a se transformar, ficando descontrolado por dio, raiva ou dor intensa (adrenalina sabe). Quem nunca leu hq faz essas perguntas mesmo.
screenjunkies haaaahahaha... verdade! como eles se comunicam? chip implantado nos cabeo? rsrs
screenjunkies Your hair is awesome.
screenjunkies 414 Albanian people watched this video o.o
screenjunkies Screen Junkies, please make more of these comedic sketches!
screenjunkies They made TAKEN 2 on the logic that the low life russian protitution ring mobster would want to avenge the anonymous death of his son(s) left for dead in the trail of the overskilled godlike pissoff of a father Liam Neison is. I bet the third installement will include the family of the big headed buyer. And guess what http:www.allocine.frfilmfichefilmgencfilm214007.html   Why Liam!?! Why?
screenjunkies is there an honest trailer for Taken?
screenjunkies This guy needs to be the new host on too much tuna nickkroll toomuchtuna
screenjunkies Taken was great but Taken 2 made it feel like just another action movie, and they just showed the same landmark in that movie over and over because it was the only famous one there, they should of picked a better place to shoot the movie.
screenjunkies This is crazy funny too. These guys are geniuses.
screenjunkies OK people heres some handy knowledge that just may help if you wind up in a situation like this.mondayfunnies  taken2
screenjunkies Honest Trailer for Taken
screenjunkies Battlefield earth honest trailer.
screenjunkies D OMG thats fucking epic !
screenjunkies I dont think she can run too fast
screenjunkies I am an Albanian and Im upset with you, Hal......prepare to be TAKEN!
screenjunkies I like where you punched sifu in the dick.
screenjunkies WTF LOL this is something borat would pull off... Liam Neeson is badass
screenjunkies saddam Hussein ? 3:33 ?
screenjunkies Jose its SpanishPortuguese name. Albanians have names like Bekim, Agron, Blerim etc.
screenjunkies That dude looks like Saddam
screenjunkies Is that liam McIntyre??
screenjunkies The main guy talking reminds me of Andy from the show Weeds
screenjunkies Umf. That instructor can throw me around :3 Where do I sign up for his class?!?!
screenjunkies If DISNEY had made the new Joseph GordonLevitt  Bruce Willis movie, LooperDisneys Looper (1994 Trailer)
screenjunkies Bet Pedobear and forever alone guy agrees with you completely.
screenjunkies Im hoping you have something better in mind than shooting me in the head?
screenjunkies Its mostly taken from the Bruce Willis movie The Kid with Joseph Gordon Levitt footage spliced in. The Kid, wasnt really that good. Maybe It would have been better if Levitt had actually played the younger Bruce Willis.
screenjunkies What a crazy coincidence, I saw that video too
screenjunkies Great Scot we have to send Bruce Willis of now today to himself in the past!
screenjunkies Turns out your best friends is you. Story of my life.
screenjunkies Well I did not know that so you you dont have to act like a snob.
screenjunkies Bruce really loves himself.
screenjunkies Wait a second joseph gordonlevitt was the kid in angels in the outfield???? MIND BLOWN!!!!!!!! THAT WAS MY FAVORITE BASEBALL MOVIE AS A KID!!!!
screenjunkies Yes, thats exactly what I said only for all 3 films.
screenjunkies Say: The Human Centipede: 100 Medically Accurate. Now do the The Human Centipede, parts 1  2.
screenjunkies Someone should really fire the ads  marketing department in youtube. They are playing the same ad for almost everything single of these clips by screenjunkies. The very same ad, in the very same day, the same hour. It becomes annoying and I just ignore it. Redbull is really dumb to advertise in this way, cos the only thing they get is frustration towards their brand.
screenjunkies this should be a top comment. i cant be the only one asking this.
screenjunkies Listen, man. EVERYONE wants to meet Bruce Willis, even Bruce Willis.
screenjunkies lol you got me there.
screenjunkies well, i disagree with your disagreement. youtube is a harsh world bro
screenjunkies The movie is too easy to pick apart. Theres nothing to really say to defend it except call people who didnt like i haters.
screenjunkies Ok, Im pretty sure this was all staged. The kid I could believe, but half these people are grown adults who have probably seen enough movies to at least know the basics of storytelling to know Avengers did succeed in those regards. It all just depends on whether the story resonates with you or not.
screenjunkies I wont say there werent problems with the movie, but I loved it nonetheless. Sometimes you want to watch a comedy, sometimes you want to watch an intricate mystery, sometimes you just want to watch fight scenes and explosions. I got my eye candy out of this film.
screenjunkies Seriously reading some of the other comments, why the little girl??? she a little girl she wouldnt understand properly, you should be directing it at the fag in the yellow shirt, how fucken dare he!!!!! Complete garbage MAJOR ASSHOLE!!!!! YES I AM A COMIC NERD AND HAVE THE AVENGERS SYMBOL TATTOOED ON MY LEG! IF YOU HAVE NO INTEREST AT ALL  SHUT THE FUCK UP
screenjunkies I didnt like The Avengers....
screenjunkies I didnt like the girl
screenjunkies he had chicago 1s on.... Im weird.
screenjunkies do a video with watchmojo.com
screenjunkies If my future children dont like the Avengers, Ill ground them, too.
screenjunkies I disliked the old lady cause she didnt even know what u were talking about
screenjunkies the Beverly Hills Chihuahua kid because she cant tell the difference between fiction and nonfiction. and Loki and Thor are not blood related because Thor is the son of Odin and Loki is a son of a frost giant my 3 year old cousin even knows that
screenjunkies I did not like the girl.
screenjunkies I hated that little girl.
screenjunkies That little girl. Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2... just... I cant.
screenjunkies I like how at the end Hal was like What the hell is wrong with you people? lol
screenjunkies I hate the Avengers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies I wen to the movies twice back in 2012 to see the Avengers and feel asleep both times! It was sooooooooooooooooooo boring!
screenjunkies THe little girl says she doesnt like fiction yet her favorite movie is a movie about talking dogs
screenjunkies That girl was a freaking brat. xD
screenjunkies Holy shit his face at 0:18 nearly killed me
screenjunkies he needs to interview Sandra Bullock... coz she speaks German LOL would be interesting to see both speaking German together haha
screenjunkies Susan Sarandon throwing a punch and saying Boom, just made my day! lol
screenjunkies Flula is FCKING AWESOME.
screenjunkies I love the big flula drop at 1:44! Seriously flula, do more. So great
screenjunkies Am the only one who thinks he looks like an older McLovin?
screenjunkies WHAT? He should have ended with DANCE! :(
screenjunkies I think actors promoting their movies must be relieved when a guy like this comes along to break up the monotony of hearing the same questions over and over.
screenjunkies I am watching this movie because of this interview.
screenjunkies Fluuulaaaaa! I have that shirt! hahaha 3
screenjunkies There are no party poopers in this video.
screenjunkies Haha, Genius, but not in a creepsy way.
screenjunkies i love your accent xD
screenjunkies a friend of a friend told me about this video. i am liking it.
screenjunkies i love your accent xD
screenjunkies What is this shit!?..
screenjunkies Awesome!!!! So nice to see you have success everywhere now!! support and love from germany flula! :)
screenjunkies DJ Flula was funnier the first time when he was called Ali G.
screenjunkies BOOM!!! Love your interviews!
screenjunkies Omg I love Flula. He does a lot of hilarious stuff on his YouTube channel.
screenjunkies Maybe he just like him. Thats why hes asking.
screenjunkies i just love how funny Jason Segal finds him to be
screenjunkies Im 99 sure this is an act..
screenjunkies Xalner is right... My god you people are retards.
screenjunkies Dumb. Chrimbus Special is a SPECIAL and not a movie, and The Comedy only has them in it, its not their movie. The Comedy is not written or directed by them. Also, what the fuck is Millionaire Dollar Movie?
screenjunkies Its scary how well he can pretend to be high on shrooms. Its almost as if... HES DONE THEM BEFORE :O
screenjunkies Who the fuck would spell like you. UR DA ONLEE GAY NIGGA TW0 SPELLZ LIK DAT FAGGOT.
screenjunkies Was expecting like Harry Potter or something. I think those are just normal mushrooms. Sorry guys :
screenjunkies By bragging so intensely, and attempting to aggressively bash another fellow boomer, you have totally defeated the purpose of taking that journey in the first place. No one gives a shit how many shrooms you have taken. Besides, a quarter is not that hard either.
screenjunkies since when does tripping on shrooms make you a real man. Get outta the kitty pool and move up to bath salts. Eat some faces and shit! Now thats manly.
screenjunkies Here is how you know its fake, never once does Eric say holy shit I think Im on something
screenjunkies i know i didnt sub to this gay shit how did i get here? unsubbed as of now didnt now i was on a gay channel ..my bad
screenjunkies I love them. Eric is hot...
screenjunkies My favorite tim in Erik moment is when they roll around in poopy in a child pool full of poop in a childrens pool all the while while singing poop song! Tim in Erik hdicker rule and rock!
screenjunkies most elaborate plan to make when one is tired of getting interviewed
screenjunkies I love how Tims moustache is beyond irony, beyond being an actual moustache... its sort of on its own. Does anyone know what I mean? Or am I talking balls?
screenjunkies Erics so cuuuute. Doesnt he melt your hearts?
screenjunkies That was my uncle Buck...sorry DandySteps
screenjunkies Lol, Tim and Eric dont do drugs. Its an act. They frequently lampoon the notion that their comedy routine is inspired by the use of psychoactive drugs in their show. Theyll often say theyre on drugs and demonstrate cliched druginfluenced behavior to an awkward extreme in order to show how silly it is to assume overthetop absurdity must be inspired by drugs.
screenjunkies theyre comedians. they improvised that whole thing. stop being a smartass retard and appreciate the awesome of Tim and Eric, great job...
screenjunkies I love their laughs lol
screenjunkies Its fake Im sure, but I have seen someone eat an eighth and act like this.
screenjunkies Thats exactly how you would act if you started tripping after eating your sandwhich. He doesnt know hes on shrooms.
screenjunkies Dem deez dis guiz r faggzzz! This movie is amazing!!!
screenjunkies O MY GOD THE BROWNIE MOUNTAIN ONE MUST HAVE BEEN SO INTENSE
screenjunkies hes not tripping, its a joke dude
screenjunkies Its a funny little gag ya dingus!
screenjunkies why would you make a video about peoples last words and then play loud ass music over it?
screenjunkies How can you NOT have Clever girl.?
screenjunkies What was the movie at 2:19?
screenjunkies My last words You stay, I go. No following...
screenjunkies whats the music at 3:03 called?
screenjunkies 2:07 The music at this part please?
screenjunkies im sorry but your music made half of these shit
screenjunkies Is that the music from the Transformers movie? You know, the part where everybodys favorite character dies?
screenjunkies Did anybody ever watch sin city? man that guy...
screenjunkies 0:46 what movie is this?
screenjunkies Anyone knows the whole list of movies? Dont recognize some, which means I have movies to see. :D
screenjunkies Start diggin Trout......wheres that at?
screenjunkies AGHHH! Cant sleep! The thumbnail! AGHHH!!!
screenjunkies what did Christian Bale say?
screenjunkies You umm.. made the music louder than most the clips. Nice job.
screenjunkies 1:40 transformers, I cired.. :(
screenjunkies whats the movie at 2:15 ?
screenjunkies live long and prosper
screenjunkies Aaaaand it is blocked in my country haaahaa
screenjunkies TOTAL RECALL :  You can,t shoot me, were married ! BLAM ! Consider that a divorce ! )
screenjunkies They should do another one including the following films: Clive Owen in the Bourne Identity, Robert de Niro in Heat, Tom Cruise in Collateral, Leonardo di Caprio in the Departed, Jeremy Renner in The Town, Chow Yun Fat in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Sean Connery in the Untouchables, Rutger Hauer in Blade Runner, Stephen Baldwin in The Usual Suspects, Tom Berenger in Platoon, Alan Tudyk in Serenity. Just a suggestion.
screenjunkies vader: tell your sister.... youre my ride
screenjunkies it was from braveheart
GameSack It really was an impressive port. Only a few effects got toned down. The biggest was when you touch fuzzy and get dizzy.
GameSack thats the most annoying elevator ever! lift going down, 5th floor, door opening
GameSack The woman standing there with a mic in her hand kind of ruins the effect...
GameSack Everything about this video is the greatest thing Ive ever seen
GameSack Scott  Chris are my favourite people in the world, this is hilar!
GameSack Scott and Chris are the best!
GameSack Lmao was funny but would of been better if a mic and camera werent stuffed in his face!
GameSack Dan and Phil should actually do this. Dan should be the one behind the phone, and Phil should be the one carrying the speaker. It could be hella funny. Or just make fun of Dan by making Dan carry the speaker! But, Im sure Phil wouldnt be as cruel as Dan in putting those sentences. Haha.
GameSack omg that was so funny but way too short
GameSack Chris is the best prankster in Radio 1. I look forward to the day he has his own radio show.
GameSack The person with the massive microphone ruined it. So the ppl in the lift were in on it
GameSack I love these two!! They are the best thing on radio, I adore their show, and radio 1 in general
GameSack Love it, please do some more. Maybe in public like a bus stop.
GameSack This was really funny, you should do more of these!!
GameSack This is the reason Scott and Chris should be on breakfast full time. At last a reason to tune in to bbc radio one between 6.3010.00howtocreategoodradio
GameSack Oh say can Yoshiiiii?
GameSack I think acme made the new music.
GameSack My personal way of dealing with the 1 sack drop is to switch it up to 10. That makes me feel like its rare enough to work for, but not a hopeless drop. The devs made a bunch of LUA code changes so its simpler, I think. If anyone wants to know look for DontStarvedatascriptsprefabskrampus.lua, change krampussack, .01 to krampussack, .1.
GameSack It was quite a big problem if you hadnt made preparations beforehand. Especially quite difficult to do in the early game when youre still getting set up and getting the materials you need.
screenjunkies Whats funny is if they HAD just used the word fuck and nothing else, the video would be longer.
screenjunkies Lots of F words hahahaHey guys! Just started up my YouTube channel about a month ago and it consists of me giving reviews on movies, games, and even talking about some recent movie news. Since it is still fresh, there is not a whole lot up right now, but it is definitely worth checking out!For those who do, thank you so much! It means the world to me listening to me talk about one of the things I truly love. Thank you :)
screenjunkies ARGHH I CANT STAND IT !!!! FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUKKKKKKKKKK
screenjunkies if u added fuck to ur list then the video would be 10min longer
screenjunkies F words. haha clever.
screenjunkies FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
screenjunkies Lol this gave me a headache
screenjunkies ahaha Ive been Fooled
screenjunkies Amazing...compressed the whole movie into 2:30... dont need to watch it again now!
screenjunkies This is stupid, dastardly bastards.
screenjunkies I see what you did there!
screenjunkies i see what you did there
screenjunkies This episode was bought to you by the letter F.
screenjunkies You could have just counted the actuals fucks in movie because now I dont give a fuck about this video
screenjunkies CAN YOU DO ON SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
screenjunkies I feel like this wouldve been funny if I wouldve watched the movie.
screenjunkies i think its great that Arnie Grape gets a cameo in this film.
screenjunkies Have ur mom watch human centipede 2
screenjunkies i feel the same thing about jenny she was the biggest bitch ever.
screenjunkies Good burger hands down!
screenjunkies Wheres The Big Lebowski?
screenjunkies Watch Were the World Mine or the short Fairies it was based on!
screenjunkies I would have to say True Romance is my favorite 90s movie because it taught me the origins of Sicilians.
screenjunkies Terminator 2...great Action and an epic Soundtrack! And never again was Sarah Connor so alive!
screenjunkies Terminator 2: Judgement DayNot only an amazing movie regarding script, acting and special effects, but also for being the exception to the rule that Sequels are never as good as the original. As great as the original Terminator is, part II blew the original in twists, darkness, character development and brought us the T1000. And then they made parts 3 and 4...
screenjunkies I think Terminator 2 is still the best action 90s movie...
screenjunkies What about the crow brandon lee?
screenjunkies Blues brothers!!!!!!!!!!!Oh yeah and forrest gump is amazing!
screenjunkies watch the room with your mom
screenjunkies You should watch A Serbian Film with your mom. My favorite 90s Movie is Star Wars the phantom menapfffskf, sorry, i just couldnt finish writing it! but seriously, my personal best might be Total Recall. Why? well, i dont know, 3 tits?
screenjunkies Austin powers  the spy who shagged me
screenjunkies Usual Suspects... Lowbudget expectations lead to a huge success... Perfectly written as well.
screenjunkies I dont know if this was made in the 90s, but I like National Treasure.
screenjunkies Lets. Talk about 80s genre shall we.
screenjunkies Do the Best 80s movies! I love the 80s! Everybody who loves the 80s start demanding that they do a Best 80s movies episode!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Oh fuck you fat ass it was a great movie you bitch
screenjunkies why you didnt mention fighting club?But Im glad that you put the south park movie on the great not mentioned film list at the end
screenjunkies Watch wolf of wall st with her
screenjunkies You guys realize you spoiled the 6th Sense on the worst M. Night Shyamalan movie episode.
screenjunkies A life less ordinary. Ewan McGregor Cameron Diaz, surprisingly great team
screenjunkies MEMENTO!!! totally made an amazing movie INSIDE the mind someone with short term memory loss by filming everything backwards!! Making the plot twist actually happen in the beginning (technically the end) of the movie.
screenjunkies Watch it with your mom
screenjunkies I personally loved the first gremlins movie, second one not so much but it was alright.
screenjunkies How about an Honest Trailer for the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie?
screenjunkies Make Honest Trailer of SpiderMan of Sam Raimi!!!
screenjunkies Say: You know nothing, Jon Snow
screenjunkies I lost it at Leonardo NoOscaro LOL
screenjunkies Say : why do you wanna kill me!
screenjunkies Pleas say:May goose tan laws free hole eat us!
screenjunkies Your videos are consistantly absolutely hilarious whilst also being incredibly astute, biting critiques! You never cease to amuse and impress  Im completely in awe of your work. Your GODS and YOU FUCKING ROCK DAMN IT!!!!
screenjunkies LEGO MOVIE! EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Say : Greed is good with your awesome voice !
screenjunkies Say STRANGEEEE MUSIC bitch
screenjunkies great fucking trailer..fuck..
screenjunkies say, theres a snake in my boot!
screenjunkies Do the sixth sense!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Or i am going to kill u!!!!
screenjunkies Pleeease say it rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again
screenjunkies Preach on Nick Mundy!
screenjunkies The sequel to this episode should be, How to fix a guy that yells to much. Seriously, this guy is yelling like there are other people in the room debating against him... dude relax. (edit) Ok nvm, i just clicked on another video of how to fix, and its just his character.)
screenjunkies bury all copies and memory of any of them being made, at Fukushima
screenjunkies Lets not forget one of the most important things in making transformers cool.PUT THE FKING THEME SONG IN IT!That alone will up it by about 2 stars!
screenjunkies I feel like I will allways love Transformers no matter what. I am excited for Transformers 4 because of Mark and FUCKING DINOBOTS!
screenjunkies I say we teach the movie industry a lesson. Everyone just wait for it to come out on Bluray or DVD and rent it from Redbox. They would make a killing and the studio would learn a lesson. Every movie doesnt need action and humor and sadness and a love story and drama. Also, its a movie it doesnt have to be filled from beginning title to end credits with constant talking. Especially if its an action movie. Action, thats all we need, TO SEE!
screenjunkies The drugged brownie turned me off from Transformers ever since. It looked like a crappy highschool campus comedy.
screenjunkies If you guys really complain so much about everything. Why dont you guys try fixing for yourself and make a perfect transformer movie?
screenjunkies So, are Mr. Bays films better when you get a staff interview where the expletive deleted was Nick Mundy for the TMNT review?
screenjunkies Its funny cause hes fat
screenjunkies im excited but i really hope the dont mess it up as well
screenjunkies It all just breaks my heart. Transformers has to be one of my all time favorite series and all of the live action films for it are just terrible. I have more faith in Transformers: Rescue bots than Bay at this point.When I see TF4 I will do the same thing I did for the last one: turn of my brain as the movie plays, then when its all said and done, rage. I wish I could expect something good or different, but when you look at the previous data, thats just not gonna happen.
screenjunkies Really, random fat guy who yells? Execs who made BILLIONS of dollars on just, 3 movies, are gonna listen to you? Seriously 2.7, once again BILLIONS, of dollars with only 3 movies. You say less funny yet you want a witty main character. You say more action then show less than 10 of the egregious amount of robot fighting porn of the movies. Then use Pacific Rim as an example, the shots are fair mind you, but the fights are dumb. Only one Jaiger has a sword? Its not like guns are the main weapon of these machines, simply punching them in the face is the best move, and yet only one goddamn sword was seen. The sequal better be like hundreds of Jaigers and they all have swords, or hammers, or maces.
screenjunkies Anyone else think Nick is an annoying fat shit who is about as funny as a high speed car crash?
screenjunkies Oh, dont forget: stop making the Transformers BACKGROUND for human actions! Its a TRANSFORMERS movie, for goodness sake!
screenjunkies we havent got a trailer for it yet in britan
screenjunkies They play Linkin Park you dumbass .. its not nickelback!
screenjunkies Why does he love Michael Bay? Guy hasnt done a really good movie since Bad Boys.
screenjunkies The problem with Transformers is Michael Bay. That guy... SUCKS!!!!!!!
screenjunkies I agree with everything they said to fix transformers.
screenjunkies How to fix Jurassic Park, please. Also, How to fix Star Wars and how to fix Indiana Jones. Thank you.
screenjunkies nicklback? isnt it linkin park
screenjunkies Heres an easy solution. Instead of wasting money at the theater, and praying for a miracle, just stay home and play the Transformers: Cybertron games. Even if youve played them 100 times, it will still be a more worthwhile experience than watching Bays Robot Circus again.
screenjunkies never bothered to watch any transformer Micheal Bay films, am a fan of the animated series n anything referenced on robot chicken. however now transformers is like xbox, alot of people want it....but only half are smart enough to say hell no to that stinking garbabe in the first place. FYI always have been a playstation gamer :)Also Nick Mundy you are the goose that lays the golden egg, you lovable thing you! keep up the good work, of strokes and rudeness. Your my idle, keep on raging. against the machine?
screenjunkies Being British.. I must say I found that comment... actually really funny. I would love to see Optimus rip Big Ben right out of the ground too. XD
screenjunkies my advice. Dump all humans from the script. This is a TRANSFORMERS movie, in it humans dont deserve storylines, they dont deserve spotlight ... Cameos are good enoth for them!I dont care about that chop shop bostan dad and i bet he is gona be in 50 of the screentime. Ok no problem i can take that crap, but it have to have at least 90 screentime with actual Transformers taking part of the scene, that are not just siting around for decoration.In the end Transformers is about one race of alliens fighting some other race of aliens, and as a coincidence thats taking place around and on Earth.
screenjunkies The Mist breaks my heart every time. :( Also why use the remake of Wicker Man? Original is much, much better.
screenjunkies Do Captain America 2 do it do it now. Obey my Orders.
screenjunkies can someone please tell me names of all the movies?
screenjunkies The Game had one too many twists at the end....... IMO
screenjunkies Anyone know what the music is??
screenjunkies What a twist!!...now which of these Honest Trailers have I not seen yet...?
screenjunkies what about iron man 3
screenjunkies Nooooo, ive been spoiled.........wait. Ive already seen these movies.....?
screenjunkies name of the song plzzzzzzzz
screenjunkies Soylent Green is People!!
screenjunkies Memento? Psh, the whole movie was basically one big twist. And why include the 2006 version of the Wicker Man?
screenjunkies You better do green lantern

screenjunkies whats the twist in saw? I dont remember one?
screenjunkies 3:10 he is a bastard though?
screenjunkies Daenarys dies. Dont want to hear you guys crying when it happens. Shes a bad character anyway.
screenjunkies By FAR its Tyrion bitch slapping the little bitch Geoffrey.
screenjunkies A very special episode? lol!
screenjunkies Actually, Joffrey is a bastard.His parents are Jaime and Cersei, and theyre not married so that makes him a bastard.
screenjunkies He didt cut his dick, but his balls.
screenjunkies Laughed so hard at the part where he says She must avenge her brothers wang!!
screenjunkies do this for the walking dead season 4
screenjunkies I know were only on episode three of season 4 but , i know my favorite episode already
screenjunkies Joffery actually is a literal bastard.....right?
screenjunkies Tyrion King Slapper is totally my favorite! :D
screenjunkies you look like that comic bookshop guy from Big Bang Theory
screenjunkies my fav part was when Tyrion moved the chair in the meetingcool to see a clever gag than just constant exposition
screenjunkies OK HAL RUDNICK I DONT UNDERSTAND A FUK OF WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, YOUR (the idiots guide to game of thrones season 12 didnt help a FUCK!!!) AND THIS ONE ITS A LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT...1WHAT DO YOU MAN THAT JOHN SNOW ITS A BASTARD? 2 WHO ARE THE WILDWINGS? OR WHATEVER. 3 WHO IS THAT GIRL WHIT BALCK THEET OR WHAT IS IT? 4 WHO IS THE HOUND? 5 WHY THERANIOUS JONH AND ARIA ARE OUR ONLY HOPE???????? YOU DONT EXPLAIN ANYTHING!!!! (AND NO, SEASONS 1 AND 2 DOSENT EXPLAINED)MAKE A BETTER IDIOTS GUIDE!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Ow my favourite part of season 3 is NONE OF IT BECAUSE GAME OF THRONES IS SHIT there is too much crap going on, my idiotic human brain cant keep track and the only reason I watched this video was because I thought Id give game of thrones another chance but it only confirmed for me that game of thrones IS SHIT and so is walking dead
screenjunkies Tyrion Lannister For King. Best Story Arya Stark Hope she kills all of them. Best action big time win for me and hottest of all the boobs Daenerys Targaryen
screenjunkies the red wedding huh i felt bad after that
screenjunkies ERIC YOUNG IS WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION!
screenjunkies Know all the characters that it said no one knew
screenjunkies Is it just me or does this guy sound and talk like Duke Nukem.
screenjunkies One and only fail about this tv show : Emilia Clarke
screenjunkies Spoiler Alert, those Easter Eggs I have in the fridge.....
screenjunkies Honestly I cant remember a lot of the names as well. Haha. So majy characters!
screenjunkies Warning this video contains spoilers from season 1 3 and in the comments everything else.
screenjunkies say Huston we have a problem
screenjunkies American Horror Story!
screenjunkies Spoiler: Ned Stark comes back as a whitewalker.
screenjunkies lord friendzone got me everytime
screenjunkies At the end you basically said subscribe if you are a dick.
screenjunkies Please do the big bang theory
screenjunkies Littlefinger made Lysa Tully murder her husband, Jon Arryn.
screenjunkies Say:I cant say this tom
screenjunkies lol its sad iknow all their names
screenjunkies Tyrion Lannister a character so awesome lol so true though
screenjunkies id REALLY like to see star wars the clone wars (animated series) as an honest tv trailer!
screenjunkies WTF is with these random ass nouns that describe people
screenjunkies Why is the resolution only 240p?
screenjunkies to be honest, the little bit with Mike saying its only a mask sold me completelly, hes my favorite turtle by far and i feel like they got it right when it comes to personality.i dont care about the origin story, just because a new movie comes out doesnt mean the old ones disappear, nor do the cartoons, comics and toys, enjoy things for what they are and not for what they might been. if kids gets into the turtles because of this and we see them everywhere again, ill be happy even if the movie is super shitty, that being said the trailer made it look like a lot of fun so ill go watch it for sure.
screenjunkies They must of payed yall a cool million to lie on camera like this...this movie is gonna SUUUUUUUUCK!
screenjunkies Im sort of optimistic. I think Michael Bay is far enough away from the film that it wont just be an awful clusterfuck of explosions and CGI, but actually have a little personality to it.
screenjunkies 4:14 Hal looks like german propaganda
screenjunkies I have many problems about the new TMNT movie, for starters i wouldve loved if the movie was inspred by the new Nickelodeons TMNT cartoon, that cartoon has an awesome backstory for the turtles, it has the best chreder and master splitner ever made, adn also has the Turtles finally acting as teenagers, for the first time ever the turtles feel like unexperience teenagers who always are learning new lessons about life, and they have PERSONALITY, real personality, unique personality, but no the director of this new movie decided to fuck all that awesmoe work and do an extremly boring backstory
screenjunkies Id shut up and see the movie first really.
screenjunkies So Shredder is old as fuck, the turtles look hideous, and were supposed to be excited for this, because... its Michael Bay? Gives look of disappointed parent
screenjunkies Im sorry but Im getting sick of them making remakes of my childhood favorites with fuxking CGI. If they didnt heavyily use that I would be fine with a remake.
screenjunkies I cant say anything about the story...but my god does the CGI look terrible here.
screenjunkies So the Turtles are patterned after Greezel from Ghoulies? I guess that makes sense, the turtles live in the sewer and Greezel likes to emerge from toilets.
screenjunkies Im cautiously optimistic. Bay is only involved in a producer sense so hopefully we dont just get a bunch of action blur and depth less characters.
screenjunkies God damn it, am going to kep asking till you do it! Do Expendables 1  2. And say: Hey ho silver, AWAAEAEAAEAEYYY...
screenjunkies To the people who may see this film  Do whatever you have to do to not support these film makers. Theyve left too many details in the dark as a trap to make you go see it to find out if its any good. And supporting the filmmakers supports that method of releasing movies (or not releasing).
screenjunkies if they say booyakasha imma slap a bitch
screenjunkies Well I dont care if its bad or good I just want to enjoy it.
screenjunkies Bay should just make porn.....lots of suckage
screenjunkies All movies of micheal bay is like transformers... and the island... please... no more micheal bay movies...
screenjunkies they look like ugly fat babies with shells . . . . .
screenjunkies GET MEGAN FOX OUT THE MOVIE!! and fix their ugly faces.. i mean i know they are mutants, but i dont wanna be afraid of their faces :(
screenjunkies GET MEGAN FOX OUT THE MOVIE!! and fix their ugly faces.. i mean i know they are mutants, but i dont wanna be afraid of their faces :(
screenjunkies Bunch of whining little bitches oh boo boo he ruined my childhood when clearly your childhood is over he cant ruin the past only the future man up you skirt wearing pussies
screenjunkies From what I see from the trailer this wasnt just Hollywood raping my childhood this was them jacking off on its cold dead corpse. I know we all have problems with it. Shredder is white and Megan Fox as April but it could be M. Night Shyamalan directing so really it could be worse. So much fucking worse.
screenjunkies megan fox, again?... gee
screenjunkies The archie TMNT series was mad cool...time travel, samurai roots, environmentalism...too bad it was cut short by, like all good things, lack of sales
screenjunkies The guy from prison break

screenjunkies Ive watched Audition thanks to this video.I...I... just... dont know what to say. All I can do is sink back into my chair and look at the ceiling.
screenjunkies Pink Flamingos: Divine ate dog poop for real. Also chicken rapeGumo was pretty Fd up to.
screenjunkies A Clockwork Orange is up there when he rapes the woman while singing.
screenjunkies the scene from blue velvet where Dennis hopper sings that song when hes high on that gas.
screenjunkies In Gozu a man was born.
screenjunkies What about a clock work orange , I spit on your grave , strangeland , or even the fireflys from devils rejects rape sex with dead people a torture pit with a crazy doctor cutting faces off and wearing them some of that is pt 1 house of a 1000 corpses but there are loads of good gruesome clips decent lineup could of had a few Better ones though
screenjunkies the scene where the baby is getting raped in the movie a siberian film
screenjunkies The most fed up scene Ive ever seen is from A Serbian Film. This scene can be summed up in two words: Newborn Porn. Ugh.
screenjunkies the scene in the movie evil dead(2013). when the branch of the tree goes into her vagina...creepyy
screenjunkies X is for XXL from ABCs of death. that or F, or Z from that same film.
screenjunkies X is for XXL from ABCs of death. that or F, or Z from that same film.
screenjunkies can anyone give the movie list?
screenjunkies As a kid, there were two movie scenes that scared me. One was the maggot birth in The Fly and blood filled balloons in Stephen Kings It. As an adult I saw a Japanese movie with a sick, dying mermaid covered in pus bubbles. An artist was using her pus to paint. The rest of that movie was rapey. I still cant get those visuals out of my head.
screenjunkies My Achilles heel feels wierd
screenjunkies What about the rapeburning scene from the hills have eyes?
screenjunkies Rock rape from Cannibal Holocaust.
screenjunkies Part of Silence of the Lambs when the killer asks the girl her dress size to see if she will fit in his skin suit
screenjunkies One opinion is enough, your opinion (the talking head) is all we need.I dont want to tune in and listen to a panel! This format sucks on real TV and now it is popping up everywhere on Youtube.Sorry, but YOUR panel is US the subscribers, and the opinions we want to hear are from other subscribers in the comments colum.This really could have been a fun relevant post and maybe only five minutes long.Instead it was padded and laime while your topic was brilliant.Fail.
screenjunkies Honest Action  Lone Survivor!
screenjunkies 4:13 Orbital Blowut You had one job, editor
screenjunkies But he is John McClain u see.
screenjunkies Do The RaidThe Raid 2. Who the hell didnt die in those two films?
screenjunkies most of these deaths are BS. Ive seen people hit in the same way in RL and they dont get rip fractors or insta death from a bottle to the head.
screenjunkies Joke is funny for a minute but after that just gets old :(
screenjunkies gravity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Please do The Incredibles, the death toll is huge (counting Syndromes minions)
screenjunkies Do THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN
screenjunkies The Mission: Impossible series is begging for this treatment.
screenjunkies I dont know your doc but Im sure I woulndt want to be one of hisher patient ...
screenjunkies More Honest Action please!!! Do Mortal Kombat or some kung fu movie! XD
screenjunkies please a 24 trailer!!
screenjunkies IF YOU DONT DO CASINO ROYALE YOURE MISSING OUT.
screenjunkies This is awesome! Do Indiana Jones next!!! Especially number 4!!!
screenjunkies mortal kombat and wth it would take 14 of him to survive that series
screenjunkies Do it on a season of The Dudesons! 100 deaths Ill guess, according to this way of doing it!
screenjunkies you should do a follow up series where they talk about how long it would take to recover in relation to what happens in the story of the movie
screenjunkies do a james bond movie!!!
screenjunkies Is it just me Or does the voice sound like the old pokdex from Pokmon ?
screenjunkies Marvel Cinematic Universe
screenjunkies How about the dark knight trilogy?
screenjunkies Nice video!5:22  5:27 Exactly :D
screenjunkies well lets just say john mcclane became invincible during die hard 4 and 5
screenjunkies Wreck it Ralph is the best video game movie HANDS DOWN!!!
screenjunkies Street Fighter II the Animated Movie was the BEST video game movie!!
screenjunkies Destroy all humans movie
screenjunkies I want to see a Duke Nukem movie.
screenjunkies Were in the darkest timeline for video game movies.
screenjunkies Id like to see Viewtiful Joe made into a movie. I mean, it IS a video game about movies. Itd be neat.
screenjunkies Have they made a movie for Rachet and Clank cz its like an aweskme game series aling with the batman arkham... games
screenjunkies Far Cry 3 as a movie would be great. The story really turns the whole sorry about colonialism subgenre on its side i.e. Avatar, Dances with Wolves, The Last Samurai etc. It could undo the disaster that is the Uwe Boll Far Cry film.
screenjunkies the phoenix wright film was pretty damn perfect.
screenjunkies Any one of the Assassins Creed games
screenjunkies MINECRAFT MINECRAFT MINECRAFT
screenjunkies Silent Hill was good.
screenjunkies I want a assassins creed movie.
screenjunkies just for record i love wreckitralph best video game movie ive seen but i rather see a new mario movie but with a different story, new plot points new main character with mario and luigi and make a saga of the mario bros. not the 1993 movie that just killed my childhood it kills it just saying as a fan in videogames
screenjunkies I would love to see a Star Wars film based of KOTOR with Revan.
screenjunkies best ever?.....wreck it ralph...
screenjunkies I feel like Hit Man with Timothy Olyphant really deserved to be on the list of decent game movies. It was a half decent movie, even without playing the games.
screenjunkies I really like the Hitman movie.
screenjunkies I dont want to see an Assassins Creed movie, but now that its going to happen I hope is at least good and that Ubisoft doesnt focus on the games main characters and uses the oportunity to expand the AC universe with new characters while focusing on the main story line
screenjunkies Zelda Movie. Animated Zelda Movie.
screenjunkies I had to search up like half of these references.
screenjunkies Ohoh... do House of Cards. Please!!!!!!
screenjunkies man i got that song stuck in my head again
screenjunkies I must be the only living thing who doesnt like Let It Go.

screenjunkies Say The Cheese is my friend. I will have cheese till the end.
screenjunkies wait wait this isnt a honest trailer cuz like she got fucking big in 3 years if its only 3 years....its more like 10 years just 3 years between her mum n dad dying and her sister becoming old enuf to be queen...just saying if you gonna be honest well at lest be honest bros
screenjunkies The parodied lyrics to Let it Go are so true. Someone needs to make a full cover of that. Holy freakin crap, that song is EVERYWHERE. You cant even say the words let it go in my school anymore without half the class bursting into song. The other day, we got into a debate on responsibilities we have as American citizens, and it ended with the most annoying kid in my class arguing with the teacher about adoption vs. abortion and the rest of us yelling at him to just shut up. I made the mistake of telling him to let it go, and next thing I hear is: LET IT GO! LET IT GO! CANT HOLD IT BACK ANYMOOOOOOREEEEE!!!
screenjunkies I STILL READ IT!The cold never bothered me anyway!
screenjunkies Aqualad from Teen Titans!
screenjunkies Hahaha I used to be an adventurer like you but then I took an arrow to the knee Skyrim 3
screenjunkies Peeta made it out of the friendzone meaning there is hope for the rest of you guys

screenjunkies They Should bring back Seth Macfarlane........and please do Honest Trailer of Godzilla 1998.
screenjunkies Harrisson Ford should totally host the next one xD
screenjunkies John Travolta should be the next host. I laugh to die every time he says sth wrong. It may makes the oscars funny, who knows? (Just kidding)
screenjunkies CHRISTIAN BALE would be something new!!!
screenjunkies Crap I looked back to see what other people!e would say and so many Morgan Freemans ,so my final answer is Morgan freeman in a chicken suit should host
screenjunkies If Nick Mudy hosted this then it would just be negative... So do that!!
screenjunkies Tracy. Fucking. Morgan. Think how great and weird that would be if he hosted. R. Kelly is a big runner up.
screenjunkies to host next years Oscars should be Leonardo Dicaprio cuz we all know hes not going to win an Oscar.... (sigh)
screenjunkies You were the right amount of mean.
screenjunkies There should be a Co presenters who make a nice pairing award.

screenjunkies Morgan Freeman should host next years Oscars

screenjunkies I want nick mundy to host the Oscars!
screenjunkies Miley and katy nd lady gaga and riahna and and that imperonater for liza manelly
screenjunkies Chuck Norris did one for a Polish bank. It was a very, very delayed aftershock of the Chuck Norris meme... which came to the party about three years too late.
screenjunkies So will there be a how to fix avengers 2?
screenjunkies Id send you and not allow you to access youtube again
screenjunkies not to be racist but japanese commercials are the most creepy and stupid that iv ever seen
screenjunkies Morgan Freeman in an old spice commercial. Nothing else needs to be said.
screenjunkies 80s Arnold was perfect choice for japanese commercials..
screenjunkies Bruce willis should do a die hard commercial for baby milk where him and the super strong, milk drinking baby defeats the enemy! :)
screenjunkies This channel is fucking annoying because of this guy. His videos are so fucking biased. All he does is talk shit about actors or movies he doesnt like. Its annoying.
screenjunkies The most useless host segments. Seriously, if you had posted those without having host segments for padding, then it would have felt less like AFV. This video eats it.
screenjunkies I have to ask where is SPACEMAN JONES.Tommy Lee Jones is SPACEMAN JONES.
screenjunkies They didnt do the Mike Tyson commercial from Poland for Black Energy Drink!!!!!
screenjunkies want to see tom bergeron as the villian in the leonardo di caprio commercial.
screenjunkies I would want to see Johnny Travolta do an add in Spain because there is no way he could say any words right if he was advertising dragonfly software to type what you say!
screenjunkies I wanna see Jayden Smith do something in Japan... as long as Jaden has absolutely nothing to do with it.
screenjunkies You forgot about Tommy Lee Jones. I am dissapoint.
screenjunkies Justin bieber for birth control.. someone had to go there
screenjunkies I think most of these actors are doing japanese commercials because the government forced them to because of the bombs
screenjunkies Liam Neeson selling McDonald
screenjunkies I would like to see the terminator singing some jap songs hahahahha MEN hahahhaha still cant get over with that hahahah
screenjunkies The Nicholas Cage ad at the beginning shows the effects of gambling (Pachinko is a type of gambling in Japan Asia)
screenjunkies Omg Nicholas cage lol
screenjunkies FOR FUCK SAKE, Leo even does the best foreign commercials, GIVE THE MAN AN OSCAR
screenjunkies lol I laughed all the way. Really hilarious! I know most of the sins facts but somehow you made it ten times funnier.
screenjunkies say I have pink nipples!!!!
screenjunkies 40 out of 50 where so not good.But u never know which one is gonna be good so u just keep watching the new onces...
screenjunkies honest trailer for fight club :)
screenjunkies the homo erotic undertones section was hilarious, laughed at every clip.
screenjunkies I have seen only few of these, and i cant stop laughing!Especialy after i heard , Nick fury and Dhalsim! My tummy hurts :D
screenjunkies Say Where is the god of tits and wine?
screenjunkies 300 rise of an empire !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Say Talking with this voice will cause my vocal chords to rupture like kidney beans in a microwave on high..but its worth it to be You Tube famous
screenjunkies From the... Scottish part of Greece?Hahahahahaha
screenjunkies Please say Whats in the booooox?!
screenjunkies men letting it hangDDD
screenjunkies the Scottish part of Greece lmao
screenjunkies Say this  I got spanked for throwing a sandwich across the room and saying Yolo.
screenjunkies Say, Lets go pork in the back room...sex
screenjunkies Full of homoerotic undertones . . . man, I havent seen a movie this deep in the closet since Top Gun. Yeah, thats about right . . .
screenjunkies TOOK ME AN HOUR TO STOP LAUGHING....
screenjunkies This has to connect to Thanos because Drax the destroyer only got his name because he wants to kill Thanos.
screenjunkies Make an honest trailer for honest trailers!
screenjunkies I thought the trailer looked good, but to be honest I didnt know anything about these characters until a couple of years ago since Im not a comic book guy. I hope the movie is going to be good but I cant judge until after I see it.
screenjunkies Right up front about the whole Shia debacle. I wonder if they lost any subs over that, cuz it was super douchey. Not quite Shia levels of douchey, but still.
screenjunkies they will first start off hating and not liking each other but will eventually start working better as a team, same with the avengers
screenjunkies the lack of nose on groot reminds me too much of HeWhoShallNotBeNamed...
screenjunkies its going to explode with a force equvilant to the amount of times the phrase IM BATMAN has been used :P
screenjunkies it will still be better than any recent dc movies
screenjunkies Disney is mopping up :)Yay for Mickey
screenjunkies im sorry the movie is not going to pop. i mean seriously its got rocket raccoon there fore its goin to be a big bang, am i right guardians fans?
screenjunkies Cant wait for this movie to bomb. I want that so badly.Bootista sucks. No one knows these characters. Really hope people dont want to see a Marvel comedy. Yes, Im a hater.
screenjunkies NOVA...... Guardians of the Galaxy 2 NEEDS nova
screenjunkies Its going to snap crackle pop rice crispy style.
screenjunkies Is it gonna flop or is it gonna pop? thats what she said
screenjunkies How could you not mention that Peter Quill is part alien?!
screenjunkies Looks cool. But I cant wait till Infinity Gauntlet comes out. I will ejaculate on Thanos mighty chest as he fist me with his ginormous hand. JINKIES
screenjunkies I love the idea of it but I just bet this movie is gonna bomb! The thing that made the avengers popular was that the heroes were built up through individual movies and then put together. Thats what made it such a success. These characters arent even nearly as well known as the avengers and havent even had a real introduction. Marvel have not advertised the movie well enough. Im not even sure what audience this movie is aimed at! There are parts that look like theyre made for kids and other parts that look more for adults! I seriously have a bad feeling about this one and Im sure Im not the only one.
screenjunkies Mark Andreyko, shut up and let the other dude finish a sentence
screenjunkies Its ganna kickin like chicken
screenjunkies If I want to watch a bunch of guys pretend to know what their talking about, I watch sports center
screenjunkies the mother fucker in the jumper wont let any one else speak
screenjunkies hmmm i wasnt looking forward to this movie, but the characters seems good, lol gotta be better then spider man and xmen
screenjunkies Almost.... Almost..........Almost.
screenjunkies Thumbs up if you watched gravity on your phone :P
screenjunkies I watched it at school
screenjunkies Say: There will only be 8 planets after I destroy Uranus.

screenjunkies Honest trailer flappy bird
screenjunkies Please do Enders Game
screenjunkies Were the Russians really retarded enough to fire a missile at a satellite in a weightless environment?
screenjunkies Starring Gus Fring, haha...
screenjunkies You guys should do Enders Game.
screenjunkies SahRkhfjgzjjhrkdufkjzm
screenjunkies What DID happen to that hairy guy?
screenjunkies Am I the only one who thought this movie sucks, and I watched it in the cinema.
screenjunkies soo...Divergent.I Divergent.think Divergent.that Divergent would Divergent. be Divergent.cool Divergent. to Divergent. do.
screenjunkies do terminator because im batman
GameSack I never though Maester Lewin would die, I liked him and it saddened me so much!
retrogametech Do you take fan mail? Got an Atari 2600 av mod kit thats not getting used. :P
retrogametech Nice fix! Glad to see another video from you.
retrogametech I took a chance on a Vectrex 2 years back for the same price with the same fault but rewiring the plug did nothing. I spent hours tinkering with the console and ended up hating the thing.
retrogametech Great console I had one of these a good game to get for is is called spike
retrogametech man... you really lucked out on that one!
retrogametech Theres a retro shop on ebay trying to sell one with one game for 150... good luck.. Theres one with no bids at 89 with a nice multicart like the one on Ashens video.
retrogametech Man, you got lucky with this purchase lol.
retrogametech Great vid  well done!
retrogametech Hahaha, I bet the seller is spewing now :PNice work mate, even if it was simple :)
retrogametech Wow so lucky! Another great video. I want a Vectrex really bad but they are quite expensive normally and I have little space to put it. Hopefully one day! Kind of funny actually, I recently bought an NES with a plug that looks near identical to that one (wires sticking out, a little rusty etc). It will need replaced soon as it doesnt work so good.
retrogametech I want a Vectrexxxxxxxxxxxx !
retrogametech I need help how can I clean n64 game to make it works again can someone help
retrogametech Wow that is amazing dude. Congrats
retrogametech dont you love fools on ebay
retrogametech That is cheap for a Vectrex. I think this is one of the most interesting things you have fixed I have seen you do not many of these around so the more working the better.
retrogametech Really cool. Ive never actually seen a Vectrex in action, Ive just heard of them. Im pretty sure an Atari joystick will work fine for it if you cant track down an original Vectrex controller.
retrogametech Awesome , been waiting for this since you first tweeted about it a while back.I love your videos man you inspire me to take my consoles repair needs into my own hands. Never paying repair fees again.
retrogametech Sweet pickup  easy fix for the win
retrogametech Thats an awesome console! Please upload some footage when you get a controller working!
retrogametech WOW they didnt check the plug before they sold it?
retrogametech Nice vid and a great score. Still, I would not be plugging in 30 year old hardware (especially highvoltage CRT stuff) into the mains without opening it up and inspecting the internals first. You never know what condition the electronics are in after all these years and theres the possibility of permanently damaging something.
retrogametech Another RetroGameTech video? Oh YEAH!
retrogametech Nice videos . please make more
retrogametech Im not envious, honestly !
retrogametech Good to see a new vid :)
retrogametech This is awesome. Find it funny that this system was 6 years before I was born so theres my excuse for having never heard of it.
retrogametech I think you got extremely lucky on only the power plug being faulty. With the age of the machine (32 years!), I was thinking it was going to be hell to repair. Great video though!Im wondering if youll eventually try to score a faulty Xbox OnePS4 to repair and sell on for profit (or keep). Do you think you could try it, or would it be too expensive to gamble on right now?
retrogametech played the same console in game in glasgow a few year ago, hink they were selling it at the time for 80 odd quid, 26 quid is a steal, nice find man :P
retrogametech Wow, people continue to amaze me, what they will sell as faulty. Well at least you were able to take advantage of this deal.
retrogametech Oh wow, now that is retro!
retrogametech The explosions look kind of like the pulsar map from the golden disc aboard the Voyager Spacecraft.
retrogametech Awww man blue balls are the worst!
retrogametech I wouldve wanted Shadow, myself.
retrogametech You must be the only person in known universe to get two out of the two characters you wanted from two blind balls.
retrogametech I found them at The Works, there were only 2 left, the two in this video! :)
retrogametech you are not ashens. but i enjoy your show just the same.
retrogametech Managed to get the whole set of these in poundworld by peering through the holes lol. You can sort of tell what they are.
retrogametech I buy my gachas for four hundred yen. Really good quality!
retrogametech What the hell? You jammy git. You only had two  you got both the ones you wanted. Buy a lotto ticket asap.
retrogametech The quality is horrible. And wtf they put werehog Sonic and not Tails?
retrogametech If I was you martin, Id go out and buy a scratch card, abd also enter the comp on this morning! Lol also just realised you look abit like the lead singer from bullet for my valentine.
retrogametech Stop playing with your balls!!(realizes there are others reading this comment and blows a kiss to all of them)Goodnight everybody! (Hint: its an Animaniacs reference of sorts)
retrogametech did u met with ashens in poundland? :D
retrogametech Finally a new vid glad to see your ok
retrogametech Poundland? Never wouldve expected
retrogametech I dont mind about your lack of uploads as when you do upload they are really great quality :D! Keep it up man 3
retrogametech dont stop man  i love your vids  1 fan
retrogametech Love them black GBAs and SPS
retrogametech I love the gameboy micro. Its screen is so nice and size just makes it probably one of the best handhelds. Good to see you back!
retrogametech Wow I really want that first black GameBoy SP you pulled out of the blue case, Ive always wanted one.But I understand its part of your collection and I wont even bother asking if you would sell it.Beyond that like you said at the beginning YouTubes Content ID BS has killed 80 of the YouTubers I watch, kinda sad when YouTube has pretty much replaced broadcast TV for me.
retrogametech Hi there.. Where are you from actually?? Uk??
retrogametech Youre genuinely one of my favourite youtubers, You inspired me to fix faulty consoles and i know have 2 PS3s (One being backwards compatible), 2 DSs, a DSI and an SP. Couldnt be happier with my new hobby :) as long as keep making videos, ill keep watching them even with shitty google.
retrogametech Great video mate, nice to see you back :)
retrogametech Good to see you back mate! Ive missed my dose of awesome hardware mods : )
retrogametech Ive only started watching the last few months buy your eBay repair videos really helped me repair my gameboys awesome vids!
retrogametech can anyone tell me if it is worth getting a psp go?
retrogametech Wow thats a great collection of handhelds. I must get the Gameboy advance my kids had one back in the day but not a mod one. Great vid mate.
retrogametech Nice to see you back Martin. :)
retrogametech I hate this new comment system! GO TO HELL GOOGLE
retrogametech Found and got it! For 25 US dollars or 15 british pounds!!! Didnt get the charger but I got a great deal!
retrogametech Omg he has the talk o phone
retrogametech Hey what hard shell case are you using for your back lit modded GBA? (The black one). Ive got a backlit GBA and am really needing a hard carrying case for it and that one looks perfect. What brand is it?
retrogametech Hey Martin, Hope all is well man. Happy New Year. Excellent collection there. Awesome! You really know how to take care of your collection. Great stuff..:
retrogametech good vid mate, love the vids )
retrogametech Glad your back, your videos are very interesting. Hopefully we can get more eBay junk repair videos too as I find those very educational and interesting to watch.Keep the good work up!
retrogametech Great to see you back.
retrogametech such a brilliant collection! im soooo jealous! :D
retrogametech glad to see you back man, ive missed your videos.Cant wait till you do the gba shoulder button mod! been trying to do some mods myself and thats something i would definitely like to do as well.
retrogametech Welcome back. Look forward to what youve got to share in the future!
retrogametech I missed you, glad your back. Google really needs to give up and just let Facebook have the social network crown.
retrogametech very cool. im very appreciative of the special guy who sorted me out with a GBA SD cart, i havent even begun to scratch the surface of the games on that thing, but i know itll last me a very, very long time. big love to that guy. :)
retrogametech Is that limited edition GBA the 1001 model (backlit)? looks awesome. Have yet to track down a decent priced one of those.
retrogametech Glad you got it working, should be a handy tool for you to play about with.
retrogametech Awesome you got it working! Youtube is filled with great helpful people :)
retrogametech Cool. I was thinking about a side project to do one day, hacking into a GBA, and replacing the insides with Android hardware, to have an ultra emulator with other functions, I have a DS with emulators but its the original and its not sleek or small.
retrogametech Was there any games on the flash cart? That would have been an added bonus.
retrogametech Does dumps piratebootleg games?
retrogametech Great news....your last vid inspired me to get my old ez flash 2 cart working and I used an old laptop and now run xp on it....playing wario ware and GTA on my micro has been great fun...keep up the great work with these videos.....
retrogametech Does the GBWriter also read gameboycolour games?
retrogametech Why do you have windows XP
retrogametech Where are you? I miss your videos!
retrogametech Plus the GBA seems like a good size for something like a multi format emulatorgame machine.
retrogametech When you do get it sorted, please do a video of it all working. Seems really interesting.
retrogametech How do you go about fixing game carts, any ideas anyone?
retrogametech Nice! Ive always been looking for a flashcart, but honestly none seem very good. The EZ looks OK, but is really a bit too expensive...
retrogametech http:www.emuzone.netgbaspgbaflashcards.htm try this site. they seem to have pictures and links to more than a dozen software and hardware combos.
retrogametech I think I might have found something:http:mynewdata.tripod.comsoftware.htmXlinker V4.0 looks like it might be worth a shot.
retrogametech RetroGameTech  Heres the IT Technicians way of locating drivers, seeming I am one myself. :)Go to Run  Type devmgmt.msc  Find the device under the device manager  right click and select properties  Click the Details tab at the top of the window  In the drop down box and select Hardware Ids  The box below will show something like dev0000 ven0000. Once you have the Device and Vendor IDs, head over to http:pcidatabase.com and enter those two numbers into their website and it will tell you exactly what your device is and the website of the manufacturer where you can download drivers from. This may not help you solve your issue, but it may give you a few clues on where to look.By the way, if the hardware id comes up as something like: USBVID177FPID0250, just search those two numbers in Google and that should give you an idea on where to look as well.
retrogametech Run a search on GBATemp or pop the question on their forums.
retrogametech That is an ez flash 4 i have the same one, great little thing.
retrogametech i think this is the site http:gbwriter.software.informer.com and how much did u pay for the ez flash?
retrogametech http:filetrip.netndsdownloadsflashcartfilesdownloadewinclient072f3383.htmlhere is the client for the smart card, it also contains the driver as well
retrogametech Hey this is exactly how my atari2600 backup cartridge works. I made a readerwriter that connects to the pc which allows me to save digital copies of all of my 2600 games and then put any game on the battery backed ram cartridge. I was wondering if something similar existed for other systems and you just showed me the gba has such a device made for it. Thanks for sharing!
retrogametech Have heard that EZFlash advance drivers can work with this. Tried any of these? http:www.ezfadvance.comEZFlashSoftwareDrivers.htm hope it helps
retrogametech Have you ever had any experience with an R4i Card for the 3ds, Im looking into buying one, any opinions?
retrogametech Dude you could Theoretically dump a rom with that.
retrogametech Just google : Ewin Client 0.72 Download , first link.
retrogametech http:www.hkems.comdownload2020Transferer2012.htmDid some looking around, and found some similar software that might just be compatible. I have no idea, but I guess you could try it out.Keep up the good work on the videos!
retrogametech Hey there Martin, I have a cart which seems to be the exact same as the one you got there  only the stickers different. The SW package that came with it weighs in at 6MB, let me know if you want me to upload it somewhere.
retrogametech Have you tried GBWriter? Going way way way down the google rabbithole I found an old post in Polish that says that the EZ Flash Advance II and the Smart Card II (which this is) are the same cartridge and use GBWriter. At the time, the software for this came on a minicd in a separate package that had to be bought separately(!), I found a photo of it, not that thats any use.
retrogametech Im pretty sure my mate Gazz had one of these. it came with a cd with the drivers and software on which if I recall his pcs antivirus would go nuts everytime he used it.
retrogametech http:www.mediafire.comdownload40yrylf0sq3msduewin0.66.rarThat should be it...
retrogametech I like my EZFlashIV until I discovered the other week you have to patch the damn games using some weird Chinese program that doesnt exist for Mac! I completely forgot you had to do that!!
retrogametech Whats the gbc one called
retrogametech Check this out http:gbatemp.netthreadssmartcard256mbgbwriter.35407
retrogametech The back of strider 2 has korean on it im learning it :)
retrogametech I think the label on Strider II is Korean, but I dont know
retrogametech May i ask retrogametech do bootleg games work as good as the non bootleg ones?
retrogametech Thanks for the shout Martin, glad you like the bootlegs thought they might go nicely with your scorpion etc! Tbh I havent really given Strider 2 much time, only tested it but I love the two shmups, I couldnt tell the difference between those and the originals.
retrogametech This is the most Hyeper Neo game I have ever seen.
retrogametech Yeah Martin, That is Korean.
retrogametech Pretty cool :D Wonder whats inside the hyper neo 64 carts apart from ROMs?
retrogametech the strider 2 game is supposed to play like that with a lag so its not any kind of problem with the game
retrogametech The language is Korean I think seeing some of the symbols before on noodles and stuff.
retrogametech You show it with your SLG.
retrogametech Thats Hangul on that box aka Korean
retrogametech Thats korean on the back of strider 2
retrogametech Nice bootlegs! I have a couple of bootlegs, mostly Chinese. I think them ones are Korean.
retrogametech It wouldnt let me comment until I upgraded my account to use Google, this is seriously annoying.. Anyway, the language on the back of the Strider 2 cartridge is Korean. Any time you see characters that look like space invaders spaghetti hoops with all the circles and straight lines its Korean.
retrogametech i think watching your videos gave me ebay luck or something crazy i got an awesome deal on a fully boxed Perfect Dark on the n64 book and everything amazing condition for 15 by far the best deal i have ever seen on ebay i userally see boxed PDs go for 30 Oo
retrogametech Yeah, it looks like it should be good but theres something just a little off with the game. Kinda sad.
retrogametech I just bought zero mission today. Im so sad I ever sold it in the first place. I always kept fusion because that was my favorite but in all it seems zero mission is the more sought after one.
retrogametech I got that zero mission bootleg too. The seller did not even mention it was fake. If you know what to look for its quite easy to spot a fake though. I am trying to get a complete metroid collection, so Id have to hunt down a real one.
retrogametech Super shibby! Now, I dont know if its just me, but your videos seem to be quieter than most. I dont know if its just your voice, or what, but I find myself having to listen really hard when watching your videos on my phone. Just thought Id mention it.
retrogametech Metroid Fusion is by far my favourite GBA game.
retrogametech You know, (you probably get this a lot) but whenever i see a video from you, whatever it may be, it brightens my day up. i just love your videos, dude. thank you for making them :D
retrogametech Man, I really need to get back into Gameboy Advanced... WHERE ARE MY GAMECUBE CABLES!!
retrogametech DO MORE EBAY PROJECTS!! I love watching them, practically making me want to go out and buy gameboys and stuff to repair! (probably am going to). Just need to do research on systems. Hope you read this
retrogametech grate vids dude keep them up :D
retrogametech great vid, im a massive gba fan, its the only system i collect for, people dont seem to realise how many amazing games there are
retrogametech Quality games. They definitely hold their value and are pretty sought after titles.
retrogametech Youre right i am too greedy with your videos, i just really enjoy them.
retrogametech Finally a new video :D
retrogametech Glad to see youre doing more videos. You should start doing Lets play series.
retrogametech I love my GBA. Got screen light mod and I play FZero on it. Loving micro machines.
retrogametech Thanks. I use a combination of Movie maker and Vegas.
retrogametech No way!, I love bootlegs! Haha. Ive been building up a nice little collection of them over the last few months. You can find some really weird ROM hacks and cool cartridge art.
retrogametech The games I enjoy collecting are those 32 in one pirate carts. Prices of carts take the pss.
retrogametech ooh didnt even know micro machines was on GBA.. i bet that feels perfect for a handheld game great selection of games here.. good ole GBA :)
retrogametech How you spoil us with all these videos :D
retrogametech In Jurrasic Park you have to connect the shops to a path not the road.
retrogametech You mentioned that your WIi is softmodded, but not your PS2 (I assume). If you have a fat PS2, you really should install an IDE hard drive and get it softmodded. Its very easy, and shouldnt even take 15 minutes.
retrogametech My setup is very simple.Its a GBA...
retrogametech Great set up! But Im sure theres space to add a wonderful Wii U 32GB. Just the black gamepad in its stand would look awesome in your setup )
retrogametech You can get a kinect lens adapter that clips on to shorten its range!! http:www.amazon.co.ukNykoZoomRangeReductionLensdpB0050SYS5A
retrogametech U gotta get the xbox one bf4 its like a new gaming experience I use to play pc game like garrys mod not the best graphics but what. Im sayin is it feels like a pc game
retrogametech See previous comment )
retrogametech love the channel... what media player is that ... looks tiny would go great in my man cave
retrogametech Id love to but never had enough money for it. One day! :)
retrogametech Ive been holding out on one of those for a little while now. Id like to wait for the hardware and software to develop just a little further before jumping in. They look pretty sweet though! You got any recommendations?
retrogametech Same here. Id seen a thread over on HUKD and got it from John Lewis with a 5 year guarantee :) . Great TV! I appreciate you watching!
retrogametech Haha thanks, dude! I wouldnt say it was anywhere near the greatest but Im happy with it :) . I would prefer to have a dedicated room like youve got with some cabs and a sofa etc. That would be epic! haha Thanks for watching and commenting as always! :)
retrogametech Im from just outside Glasgow :)
retrogametech that sega genesis (?)  mega drive is a bulky beast! I remember seeing the tv infomercials here in the states trying to promote the elaborate, cumbersome setup and sell it to gamers. You might have the only one in the UK, mate! Great setup although i have to ask, do you ever get grief from old school nintendo fans? No retro setup is complete without an old SNES according to most US gamers. Alas, i only kept my gamecube.
retrogametech Didnt you pick up an N64 not too long ago? Or did I just imagining this? Well it seems Deus Ex is a must play :) . Lots of people praising it so I think Ill get started on that later. I didnt know youd played the first ME. If you thought the first one was even half decent then youll really enjoy the second. Personally I think it might be one of the greatest video games ever made (no joke).
retrogametech Why doesnt the 3D adapter work on LCD? I understand the light gun games need a CRT, do the glasses also pick up messages from the screen? Also what was that cart in the Saturn? Is the Xbox one connected by component cables? Do you have any old Nintendo consoles, or do you use the Wiis virtual console for all that? Sorry for all the questions, lol.
retrogametech Amazing set up, it looks incredibly well laid out and organised. The matching black scheme across the whole thing really ties it together, great work man!
retrogametech I love the format. Im still sad it lost out to Bluray because I think it was the better format. I picked up most of my discs when places like HMV were trying to rid themselves of excess stock after HDDVD lost the support of manufacturers and publishers. Most were only 12 newsealed! XD. Same as you I picked up a few 360 players from CEX and Game for between 510. Unless you run the audio through an amp its going to be pretty quiet. Are you using it with a PC monitor or something?
retrogametech Ive been thinking about getting a modded 360, but I just dont trust they will last that long at all... Shame really as they are very reasonably priced here nowadays.
retrogametech Yes, it makes absolutely no sense in why they got rid of them.
retrogametech Works perfectly for me, yes. I love mine and use them for everything other than listening to music. But shop around and dont pay too much for a set.
retrogametech I have the same TV, bought it 3 years ago for 299. Probably the best purchase Ive ever made  I think itll last me until 4K is affordable. PS Love your videos, Im an engineer so the inner workings of things fascinate me.
retrogametech Haha, repurposing. :P
retrogametech Nope, thats actually a Retro Lancer. Hammerbursts dont have bayonets.
retrogametech I wish I had something obscure. I think the most obscure thing I have is MK1 Sega Saturn control pad. Whats so obscure about it? NOTHING, that is how unobscure my collection is.
retrogametech I dont even know what that is, haha
retrogametech yeah, i know 50 isnt too bad but i find it difficult to spend that much money on only one used item. just my own hang up there
retrogametech No he didnt Kind of a chill guy to talk to. He did do the Dom voice from time to time which was cool , but you could tell he had to change his face to do the voice. I dont know if that makes any sense but yeah lol
retrogametech The dream eye would be a cool video AYE
retrogametech A future vid perhaps :)
retrogametech Lol, thats awesome! Did he sound like him when speaking normally? The first Gears of War is one of my favourite 360 titles.
retrogametech Haha, yep 100 authentic! :)
retrogametech The Dream eye was actually made to do both. Sadly only two games supported it with other planned ones, but it came out at the end of the dreamcast life cycle.
retrogametech I just bought one of these off eBay, probably from the same seller.Do you have instructions for building a supergun like the one youre using in the video ?
retrogametech Something youve ever considered picking up? Its would work perfectly with your supergun setup.
retrogametech dont know whats wrong but i couldnt Finnish watching this because of a very high pitched whistle noise
retrogametech Im really surprised that they dont sell for more! For less than the price of a new 360PS3 game you can get a fully boxed new Neo Geo system and 1 game. Crazy!
retrogametech Are you getting a cabinet at some point?
retrogametech Anyone else hearing how Joe sounds a LOT like Link during that demo fight?
retrogametech Yes, I have to admit I wouldnt mind getting one myself  the fighting board seems the best bet as it seems to support 4 games. I dont know what SNK were thinking of? After the success of the MVSAES and the great idea of one board that takes all the carts they end up producing 3 different boards... Its also a shame that they felt they had to compete with the 3D market that had started as many people loved the 2D SNK games and not the new 3D generation.
retrogametech please give that ebayers name!
retrogametech I was offered a deal with a number of games for a very cheap price..... I decided to pass as it would just end up another box in the corner. :D
retrogametech Thats awesome dude. Nice one, classic games room have a review of samurai showdown.
retrogametech I dont know much about what consoles you have, but do you have a full Neo Geo arcade cabinet? And if not, would you like to have one, or does it take too much space in?
retrogametech 8:08 One of those voices sounds EXACTLY like adult Link. Looked it up, and yep, Nobuyuki Hiyama usually voices Joe Higashi. Man, that guy gets around. I remember when I first found the Japanese voices on Soul Caliber 2 and noticed that Siegfried, Link, and Yoshimitsu all had the EXACT same voice. I mean just about pitch perfect the same. How does this guy get so much work doing the exact same voice?
retrogametech Yes, its the CRT. If youre younger, then it will likely sound louder. (Peoples hearing diminishes as they get older, and it gets harder to high the highpitched noise.) Its a noise you got used to years ago with CRT TVs and monitors. Proper retro sound. :p Doesnt bother me, but then I am getting quite old now. lol
retrogametech This is the same item Ive been looking at for week or so. I soon as I saw this vid, I rushed over to eBay and bought one, loll. Only one left now guys!
retrogametech I like how the auction posting turned into a big political rant at the end.
retrogametech In MAME still dont have sound, but i finish this game and i defeat the boss. That multigames someway must be dumped.
retrogametech What kind of JAMMA thingy do I need? Im new to this :(
retrogametech Haha, theyre practically bullet proof! Total overkill on the shielding. But those carts with the embossed SNK logo do look awesome! :) Btw great to see T3T back again! Didnt have time to make a response but 2 of your choices were identical to mine anyway! haha. And not that it matters now but Heavenly Sword on PS3 would be my third choice.
retrogametech Just curious, does arcade hardware like the Hyper Neo Geo usually have regional differences?
retrogametech Just keep trawling ebay and eventually youll find something interesting :P
retrogametech 1500!?!?! Wow, bargain! haha. I know what you mean. The games arent all that great although its still a very cool piece of Neo Geo history. But it doesnt even come close to the awesome MVS! :)
retrogametech It is an interesting piece of arcade harware to have. Maybe it wasnt successful because they spent more money on the metal housings than they did developing the games )
retrogametech Been watching videos for a long time! Always good some older tech from my childhood. Please subscribe to my channel when you can:)
retrogametech My left bumper is a bit sticky but thats what makes it so fun
retrogametech are you going to get a 2ds?
retrogametech What bit did you need? Id like to open one I got for free.
retrogametech Hello any chance you can fix my 3ds please my slot wont work and I saw your video but I dont have those tools may you please fix it for me
retrogametech Ive been using shampoo! :P
retrogametech Looked really nice and clean in the end. I have the light blue Halo 4 controllers that came with the Halo 4 custom shell console. Really nice, but it can be a little distracting when the batteries start to run out and the LEDs start flashing, due to the clear material. But Im nitpicking really, they are really nice. Have you been playing GTA 5? Ive been loving it so far, just a shame you cant install the 2nd disc without texture issues (ifwhen I get a spare 16GB USB Ill install to that).
retrogametech One dislike... The seller must have seen this video.
retrogametech Great work Martin..:)
retrogametech I wish you could fix my control. Id pay to have it fix.
retrogametech Nintendo might do something. You should contact them first, for troubleshooting and warranty.
retrogametech I think the best thing to do is just buy a new controller every year or two. It doesnt matter how careful you are with them because they always wear out.
retrogametech Thank you so much for the cool video, as always. Id need the connect button microswitch, I broke it some time ago and now I cant connect my controller on the pc and its annoying. Do you know where can I get one online? If you do have a spare one I can pay you the switch and the shipping to Italy! Thanks.
retrogametech Ah YouTube, always coming up with these innovative and handy new features :P. I couldnt see the comments on my own video until several hours after Id uploaded. I heard they were planning to make video comments only available to those with a Google account! This site is becoming less and less user friendly IMHO. I wish there was a good community based and less adrevenue focused alternative.
retrogametech Awsome...how about a lool in your parts bin? Sounds like a magical place. Enjoyed :)
retrogametech I just cleaned my controller the other day the hidden screw behind the security sticker caught me out XD
retrogametech The xbox 360 controller is very well designed but internally is a mess. The bumpers are weakly designed. The triggers may scratch the case in some cases, the analog sticks on the silver controllers scratch the internal paint and they arent smooth anymore due the friction with the border, the headphone jack may stop letting you use the headset due some internal misconnection and my battery pack isnt properly charged by any of my controllers, I use an external charger to refresh my batteries.
retrogametech Fuck off you stereo typical bastard.
retrogametech Thanks for watching and commenting :)
retrogametech With all the recent horrible YouTube updates, I can reassuringly say that it isnt a bug anymore, Larry. Theyve gone and screwed everything up again, like usual.
retrogametech I had an Famicom replica :D i got it 96 :3 i lived at the time in Ukrain
retrogametech Sweet russian sega system clone. That does not look to bad.iv seen some crapy sega clones before. Were did u get that wireless sega contorler at?
retrogametech .   ,     ,      .           ,   ,        .
retrogametech Not that youd want to, but thatd be easily made into a portable
retrogametech Yup, its Russian import
retrogametech Its the first Stage music of the first Streets of Rage.
retrogametech Lets put pokemon on it.. because... video games!
retrogametech Yay another Scottish techie YouTuber
retrogametech Sega CD addon definitely doesnt work with it :(
retrogametech Thank you! Glad you like them. Hello from Scotland :)
retrogametech In Russia mega drive x plays you!
retrogametech By the way thanks for your video. very interesting
retrogametech It had to be done! :P
retrogametech My only main issue with it is that the cartridge slot doors are bright red. Other than that, it looks pretty nice. Been considering getting a Model 3 because of the sleekness of it and the built in region mods are an excellent touch
retrogametech I have that Atgames Sega Genesis 80 games in one consoles. Its okay but the sound is off.
retrogametech I dont know why that is. It might be because Sega never officially released or distributed the console in your region? Piracy and bootlegs seem to be most common in countries where the official product is hard to find or overpriced.
retrogametech I dont know what they did but the whole site is messed up for me these days. My feed misses out loads of vids. And anything that does show up and I dont watch within 24hrs simply disappears! Plus, lots of vids are now plastered with those really freakn annoying little annotation box adverts. Google are totally killing the community aspect of the YouTube. Anyone with a smaller channel looking to increase their viewer baseshare content is basically screwed.
retrogametech I might take some photos and add them to the description for anyone whod like to read or translate the box and manual. Thanks for watching!
retrogametech You could probably make a homemade Nomad out of an old GameGear and a cheap LCD screen :)
retrogametech Loved the ending , I wonder what else can fit on that clone machine .
retrogametech Thats dicing with death :P
retrogametech I was hoping this Mega Drive X would have Mega Man X. l
retrogametech I really enjoy your videos. Also your skills with doing everything one handed is pretty impressive.
retrogametech What is your eBay account?
retrogametech I didnt realize you could rip the HDD out of a sky box... Keep the videos coming!
retrogametech Was you grounded when playing with the sata hard drive ? I allways make sure I have my anti static wrist strap on
retrogametech why do you have 2 copy of  Resident Evil Revelations  are they different ?
retrogametech How about a games room tour Martin?
retrogametech Your new subs must come from that Larry Bundy Jr chap :)
retrogametech I dont have a games room. But I do have some videos of my gaming setup on my channels main page :)
retrogametech Thanks for the update. I love your channel.
retrogametech It really depends on how many collectors are looking for them when you sell. Typically Id expect them to sell for about 10 each. 3 is a bargain.
retrogametech maybe you can use the Sky case to consolize that MVS project
retrogametech I enjoy the odd random video. I find it much easier to make videos while my kids are in school and going to bed earlier.
retrogametech I dont mind the art style, theyre just boring as all fuck. I dont want to repeat the same stage 1,000 times because I keep dying either. Platformers in general have never been my thing.
retrogametech I wish nintendo would add a second analog stick and upgrade the resolution on both screens. Also they should increase the battery to 2000 mAh :D
retrogametech Have to ask, what make soldering iron do you use?
retrogametech Yes but Im not sure how the best way to do it would be. Ideally Id like to show a little gameplay of each game as I show them but that seems like a lot of work. Suggestions are welcome :)
retrogametech I have the same Kasumi figure!
retrogametech i found a jail broken ps3 in a gamestop dumpster the ps3 start fucking up after a few weeks so i just took that hdd out and put it in my other ps3
retrogametech Some really cool stuff , learned some cool stuff aswell like the harddrive test box.stay cool dude peace
retrogametech Those things hold 500 Gigs? Wow. I use up all the storage in them in a few weeks...
retrogametech finally another pickup video
retrogametech Its hard to believe but there are some out there. My advice, stay away from American Dragon Jake Long on the DS. Just saying.. :P
retrogametech My Sky box is rocking 3TB.
retrogametech Hey your cool Im subbed :)
retrogametech I thought that yellow Game Boy was a prototype at first because of the missing lettering. :P
retrogametech Hey man, love the channel, keep it up. Hope to see a new video soon.
retrogametech A lovely woman owning a game gear ? Marry Me ! :D
retrogametech Whatever I find cheap :)
retrogametech I really enjoy watching your videos. I do also dislike the PAL DS games, guess i have to switch them out. :P BTW: the XG Blast amzn DOT to16vgGTB
retrogametech 49.5p for ico. WOW. Another great video thanks
retrogametech I was quite surprised that the Uk DS covers are the same size as The NTSC ones. Tempted to put my games in US boxes to save space.
retrogametech Martin, Id love to see your retro PC game collection and what sort of system you use to play old games with. Also would like to see the pictures you pulled off the GB Camera (if theyre not personal).
retrogametech Alright thanks man! Ive been watching, just not commenting. I was thinking of getting all the variants for my collection but didnt have money at that time.
retrogametech If you ever find an NTSC copy let me know! :)
retrogametech ICO is actually the prequel to Shadow of the Colossus.
retrogametech I did vaguely because my Pojos Unofficial Pokemon trading card book made a mention of them and had a picture, still have that book and I dont know why.
retrogametech Ico for 50p! What a deal!
retrogametech dont think ive ever seen a yellow OG gamboy before.. i left a pikachu themed gameboy colour at a shop for 7 quid, cos it had the wrong battery cover.. probably should have picked it up tho.. doh! i had one of the first gen tamagochi eggs.. a white and blue one.. i thought it was fucking amazing at the time.. blew my tiny little mind, so it did. lol
retrogametech Ive always wanted a pokemon mini!
retrogametech But was it really? Was it an official US release or just imported PAL copies? Ive never been able to find any US sellers that have an NTSC version of it. I cant even find a photo of a US copy. But, if it does exist then Id love to get it! :)
retrogametech I never knew they even existed until recently!
retrogametech Also is it time for your 2013 entertainment setup video now hint hint lol
retrogametech I actually had guitar hero on tour, similar to the one you have, and I thought it was pretty fun to play I was addicted to it for like a month, but I had to sell it once I bought the dis
retrogametech that GB transferer i want to buy it ....
retrogametech I saw your video some time ago and found it very interesting. Today I finally got myself an AGS101 second hand (Im in New Zealand) and mine is similar to yours (Pearl Blue with Aus code) but has some extra writing underneath Use only AGS002 which says Production Year: 2007 and also has a slightly different code: CAGTAUS(E4)2. Curious!
retrogametech I literally found my ags 101 when I was 7(5 years ago) in a clothing shop under a stack of blue jeans. It had a few scratches at the time and it was lucky I even found myself a free sp.
retrogametech Where did you get this SP? Im amazed youve found one in such mint condition, and an Aussie one at that. Im pretty sure I remember seeing these in Aus when I was younger.
retrogametech Man has a Australia wish I could found these. Great video
retrogametech we have the model 101 in canada too :)
retrogametech If you keep away from eBay as a seller, where do you sell things?
retrogametech Does anyone have any idea if AGS101 exists in Japan? I cant find any here. I have a couple of famicom color SPs but they are front lit. Front lit screens SPs are a nice upgrade from the regular GBAs but compared to a back lit screen, it looks pretty terrible because the colors look so faded.
retrogametech Would you believe me if I said I have an Onyx colored AGS101? :P
retrogametech Lol I have one of these.
retrogametech Very cool! Definitely have to get me one of those 101s one day.
retrogametech I have the axact same AUS model. Its the graphite color one with an EU charger lol. Bought from a guy from Singapore who bought it from ToysRuS back in 2005. :D
retrogametech Will the Aus GBA SP 001 charger work with a US or EU GBA SP 101?
retrogametech in small markets as Greece ebay is my friend.
retrogametech What kind of flat screen is that where 4:3 is available?
retrogametech great job martin, i would have done the same thing, that first neogeo just didnt seems like it was worth repairing so using it for parts seems like a good idea )
retrogametech Haha, well someone got a good deal :P
retrogametech I was like that isent damaged oh  it is
retrogametech there is a reason why this type of work costs alot, you have to factor in the cost of parts, resources, shipping to and from aswell as labor, it takes alot of time to do mods where soldering is involved
retrogametech Sounds proper nasty and makes you wonder what the hell people do with their consoles! Had the same with a Model 1 MegaDrive I picked up.... EXT port was rusting a bit and the outer shell was absolutely disgutingly bad.... All cleaned and shined up nicely in the end!
retrogametech Ive done a few vids on my setup in the past if youre interested :) . The main unit has a Bravia with SLG3000 for the retro gear. MVS gets hooked up to a Trinitron. I test all my repairs on the Bravia.
retrogametech Haha, that faulty Mega Drive from the shed has now fixed and helped me mod so many other systems. Good old SEGA! XD Thanks for watching and commenting :)
retrogametech Nice. Interesting that the system had sound issues from that one pin as the last 2pins are ground pins in both sides and it should have had some sound but none the less the bios does take time to replace traces, did that once lol. The reason why one neo needed all those parts is because it was a 5v model which is missing components but will only run on 5v although you can modify them to work on 9v, Ive done that with quite a few but some people really love the 5v models for MS X MVS on on 5v
retrogametech Out of curiosity have you considered doing modsrepairs for other people? I know theres a few people who already do that professionally but usually ridiculously overpriced for the work involved for some things.
retrogametech Nice work mate! I did a similar fix on a damage AES I received a while ago and I still own it! Works a treat! :) btw you dont happen to be on the bordersdown forums do you?
retrogametech I suppose one way to look at it is you will have a spares board full of working parts ifwhen you repair more of them.
retrogametech Nice to see that at least one of them will find a new home in fully working condition. I expected it to sell for a bit more though.
retrogametech Pro tip.. Never ever put ICs in just regular foam like that.. the chance of killing the IC is far greater than having it laying naked on a desk..
retrogametech I was watching this on ebay, i was really tempted to bid. But decided not to because of the price of the games.
retrogametech Thanks, Ed. I think the damaged corner and ghetto power switch probably killed the value :P. I would have expected a little more for it too but the market seems really dead right now. Especially on expensive nonessential items like an AES. Considering what I paid for it I was kinda tempted just to keep it for myself. But need the cash and space more than a Neo Geo right now, haha. And I have a bad habit of buying stuff to sell then keeping it for my own collection! :P
retrogametech wow, do you really have real cartridge Shantae for GBC twice time? damn you! :)
retrogametech Hey RGT what ROM carts are you using? are they any good? i have been looking for a ROM cart for use with my GBA and i have not decided on what to use.
retrogametech Nice one I didnt know about this at all! Ill need to go back and try all my VC games :)
retrogametech Is would be so cool if you could choose color of the gameboycolor
retrogametech Great little gen you discovered. Ive not bought any virtual console games. But thats pretty neat. I wouldnt have bothered researching it either so I doubt Id have come across the feature. Thanks! Btw have you heard about the Sega SMS classics being released on 3DS with their 3D depth added back again? Pretty cool!
retrogametech Cool, no not tried the GG ports yet. Good to know you can run them in native res though!
retrogametech Get a faulty one and make a video about it :)
retrogametech if you hold down select while selecting the game it will make the screen smaller sorting out the image problems
retrogametech Thats awesome thanks man.
retrogametech i didnt know about this game... just saw this price of it on ebay O
retrogametech Cheers! Glad you like them :)
retrogametech Not sure if youre trolling me but Im Scottish.
retrogametech Thanks for answering. Im pretty bummed now though that i need like 200 to buy my own.
retrogametech So cool Nintendo included that hidden feature in 3DS :)
retrogametech please can u do a 3ds review video because Im thinking of getting one
retrogametech Haha, thats great! Another WayForward fan because of me. :D They make some really amazing games. Thanks for watching and supporting the channel! :)
retrogametech If youre asking whether or not the Virtual Console rerelease of Shantae is the GBA enhanced version, then sadly the answer is no. The only way to experience the game in its full original form is still to find an original cart (or flashcart P) and play it on a GBA. Reading a recent interview with Matt Bozon, I think it was possibly done intentionally to maintain the original releases desirability and value.
retrogametech Haha, well I appreciate you listeningwatching me ramble regardless. Tbh, half the time I dont really understand what Im talking about either. :P
retrogametech Thanks. Would have like to get it running properly. Close enough I suppose. :P
retrogametech What is that high pitched background sound in this video? It drives me nuts.
retrogametech So close! haha. Its a sync issue but I have no clue how to correct it. I also suspect the CPU in the clone might be clocked differently to a real MD and that is whats causing the issues. Who knows :P
retrogametech Have you managed to get in contact with Gary Smoke? Maybe he can somehow answer this problem, or at least direct you to the people who manufactured it and maybe they would know?
retrogametech I havent, no. Id guess he only dealt with translating the instructions to English for the company who made the console.
retrogametech Will it work with both NTSC and PAL?
retrogametech Retrogametech!!! (Sorry, But i dont know your name), you are know about Super Retro trio ???
retrogametech I thought everdrives regions didnt matter, anyways never stop making videos please.
retrogametech good effort mate. never mind eh? have you come across anyone else on the internet whos tried to do this to a scorpion?
retrogametech i saw the comment now thanks for replying to my complaint and i guess there is nothing you can do so oh well but thanks i am going to try and watch the video now
retrogametech Getting even a vague form of life from the 32x on unofficial hardware is achievement enough! Good job!
retrogametech Well done mate, i think its the first video of yours i have seen without a 100 happy ending.
retrogametech i cant finish watching its a great video but there is a loud white noise coming some the video. thought i might tell you in case anyone else found it but still great video man
retrogametech Thats not a video sync issue imo. The game locking up and the background scrolling with glitches lends itself to the same conclusion. Id suggest the 32x is having problems communicating with the Scorpion.
retrogametech I love your accent.. I love how you say console. Consoooo haha Love your videos.
retrogametech Well, its the 32X so nothing of value has been lost lol.
retrogametech Try jiggling it about and turning it off and on again andor bang the tv and kick the PSU. I heard repeated shouting expletives work great too. :)
retrogametech why blend it if u cant make it smaller and why not blend sega cd uee just rewand all that make it hand hend or it a waste
retrogametech ...cont. Also not sure if you mentioned...Will a regular MD game work through the 32X on it?
retrogametech Will It Blend that is the question
retrogametech Aye, exactly what I was thinking!..... Wait, what?
retrogametech i am a guy and dont understand that stuff so relax
retrogametech is it just me, or is there a horrible high pitch noise during the video??? great vid by the way
retrogametech you should get driver for the wii was very fun :p
retrogametech Suggestions: Sin  Punishment is a cant miss game. Mad World is another great game, Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World is pretty good for an RPG. Deadly Creatures isnt too bad either...Billy Bob Thornton and Dennis Hopper do the voice acting in it.I can also tell you a game not to get....Alone in the Dark. I dont care what anyone says about broken controls in a game, the driving controls in this game are the worst in gaming. Dont believe me, play the game and judge for yourself. In this game, you literally have to luck your way through a level. Youll spend hours wrecking a car that only response to you about 25 of the time, only to completely skip over a whole level at the end...yes that broken of a game...
retrogametech hi good day the red steel game . have you had a chance to use the motion plus controller compared to the old one .. and if you have is they any difference to the game play .
retrogametech it wasnt as good as the original but was a great game
retrogametech Sonic Colours is pretty great if you havent already played it, not exactly a hidden gem but it certainly gets my recommendation.
retrogametech Had my Wii since its launch and have always struggled to find games for it. At any one time Ive only had up to 10 games for it, and currently have 5 games including Twilight Princess, Super Mario Galaxy (which if Im honest I became bored with quickly) Wii Sports and the two Pikmin Gamecube ports. Ill have to have a look around and see if I can find some cheap games to expand on my modest game library.
retrogametech Xenoblade Chronicles is by far the best game on the system.
retrogametech even if you dont like mario, try out super mario galaxy its one of the best 3d platformers ive ever played, it doesnt play like classic mario
retrogametech Thanks for the suggestions! Im wondering the same thing about the prices. Will the better games start to become hard to find and expensive? It seems to be the trend with the Nintendo consoles. Just look at how popular GameCube has become.
retrogametech Try and pick up Disaster Day of Crisis  its really good..and can be picked up for a few quid. another great video
retrogametech Try and pick up Disaster Day of Crisis  its really good..and can be picked up for a few quid. another great video
retrogametech Wii party, muramasa, and definitively super smash brothers brawl!!
retrogametech also you should find sonic colors, super smash bros, mario kart, donkey kong country returns, and metroid prime 3( i got that game for 3 dollars)
retrogametech Yeah, Ive heard a few people say its good. Does it use the Wiimotes motion sensor to control the car?
retrogametech Dokapon Kingdom is really good if you can manage to find 3 friends to play with!
retrogametech If you have your wii softmodded id suggest trying the ScummVM interpreter if youre into point and click adventures. I found the Wii mote to be a perfect controller for these type of games. There is also a compilation of the Bit Trip Wiiware games called Bit Trip Collection on disc. Its a very addictive Atari 2600 era influenced PongDefender hybrid and you control the paddle by holding the wiimite horizontal and tilting it forwards and backwards.
retrogametech i have plans to do the same.. already got a very small collection of wii games, but its somethin im gonna get into again at some point.. not got the console at the moment, but soon, no doubt.. i played epic mickey 2 and that seemed cool so i expect the first is decent too. never heard of mushroom men, or a few of the others.. ill use this vid as a reference for collecting, so i will!
retrogametech Never came out over here, Excite trucks almost as good though I guess (also really cheap)
retrogametech Metal Slug Anthology is great. No More Heroes is fun, Mad World is great. Zak  Wiki is a good puzzler, Tatsunoko Vs Capcom is an amazing fighter, House Of the Dead Overkill is hilarious and brilliant.
retrogametech Zak and Wiki is a must buy for the Wii. Also Spectrobes: Origins is pretty good. House of the Dead: Overkill is funny as hell. And that is pretty much all the Wii I own.
retrogametech Haha, years ahead of you dude! That was the first thing I did when I originally bought the thing. :P
retrogametech Ive heard thats good. Will put it on the list. Cheers! :)
retrogametech If you are in racing, you should totally buy Trackmania Wii! Its one of the best arcade racers on Wii! :D
retrogametech Tis quite nice, but since Ive got a R4 card for my DS I wont be needing one any time soon.Although, its interesting that it can play MP3s with, I assume, its built in sound chip.
retrogametech any chance to use this as a flash cart?
retrogametech Which HMV did you find this in Martin? Wouldnt mind trying this out myself.
retrogametech Nintendo MP3 players really made the GBA and early DS systems look like a deformed Siamese twin! And ya know, I never heard about any other MP3 player cartridge for GBADS that was ever capable of a shuffle mode with savestating. But to be fair, most MP3 players dont support poweroff savestating.
retrogametech Haha, thats a kinda neat addon.
retrogametech Yeah I think it used a compact flash card, he showed me it connected to his original model DS. Hed got one early, imported a Japanese DS. It must have made an impression, as I ordered a Japanese DS from a UK ebay seller a couple of weeks later. I ended up getting a DS lite later, but I traded that in against my 3DS and I still own my original chunky Japanese system :) Those were the good olf days when Nintendo were still releasing region free handhelds...
retrogametech Did you test it out on a DSDS Lite at all? Im curious as to how the layout changes when you switch from a GBA to a DS
retrogametech the flashcard I have can play music but its harder to use it because you need the earphone adapter, and it doesnt look as cool as this one
retrogametech Im not sure but its a bit strange. Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech A great little novelty for 98p:)
retrogametech the cart itself has a headphone jack. he showed it in the video.
retrogametech That sounds cool! I havent seen one of those before.
retrogametech Cool piece of tech, maybe a bit pointless.
retrogametech Ive never even heard of it before, Im surprised Nintendo didnt promote it more in the day. BTW Martin, not seen you on any of my videos for ages, are you still subbed to me dude?
retrogametech Not bad for 98p, eh? :)
retrogametech Yeah the AES. awesome!!! thanks man
retrogametech Was that one of the ones that also play videos? Sometimes they sell quite well on ebay.
retrogametech It does seem a little late for such a device but I suppose thats why it isnt very well known. If it was marketed towards DS owners then maybe it was a response to the multimedia features of the PSP?
retrogametech Would it work with the Gamecubes GBA player?
retrogametech HMV seem to be ditching all their video game stock at the moment so youre not missing out on much. They dont even have new released games these days.
retrogametech Andy crane...blast from the past
retrogametech I might make a portable (so original) GameCube. Using the classic folding screen top, and a laptop battery. Maybe even shorter cord lengths for the controllers. Probably never gonna do it, but its just an idea I had.
retrogametech Nice Video cover of the system, can you not use the audio out out on the MEGA CD ?
retrogametech SE93 is pin and function compatible VDP to original chip. SE94 is the IO and bus management chip, also pin and funciton compatible with real Sega chip found in later MD1 boards.The Oscillator is NTSC based which is why its not exactly the same.These superclones are total awesome !
retrogametech This was great. I remember some shady dudes selling the scorpion in Northampton shopping centre back in the day. And I never forgot it. Glad to hear its actually a good system. Thanks for the video, it was very informative and I loved all the tech stuff.
retrogametech Sadly theres no details on what was done to achieve compatibility. Ive got mine partially compatible but I think I might need to switch out the Xtal or find a NTSC 32X.
retrogametech I think the controllers are just generic. Ive seen loads of them in the past. They are really bad! haha
retrogametech Theres a picture of a Colecovision on the RF switch
retrogametech Ideally you need to get a scope and logic analyser onto the job and compare signals to working MD and 32x. Could be a noisy  different sync signal or something. Also possible timing difference somewhere else on the scorp  maybe that jumper on its own for 60hz isnt enough? Presumably youve tried 50hz with 32x? Great vids btw!
retrogametech You have anything cool you been working on lately? if not... go build some shit.
retrogametech Probably. Ive seen variants of this console posted in forums by US collectors.
retrogametech I think it looks kinda cool too! But thats just me :P
retrogametech Damn, now I have another clone console I want... thanks a lot! lol
retrogametech Youre no doubt correct. Ive since managed to switch the console back to 60Hz mode to remove the borders and slowdown :)
retrogametech Brings back memories of that Bad Influence episode all them years ago seeing this clone console. When I first started watching this video I was saying to myself I have seen this clone somewhere before and trying to think where before you had mentioned the Bad Influence episode they showed it on.
retrogametech That is amazing! I cant believe you found one and gave us such an up close view of it!! I remember watching the episode and being fascinated by the machine when I was maybe 7 or 8!! It couldnt have found a better owner! I bet it has another 20 years in it!
retrogametech Ha! Im surprised youve not found one at a carboot by now! :P The Scorpion branded version seems uber rare. The thing with the extra cart slot is strange. If you look carefully, even the one shown on Bad Influence is missing the extra connector. Theres another Scorpion console review on YT and it doesnt even have the hatch at all. Andy Crane also tried to plug that review cart in the wrong end! :P Beatties was awesome as a kid! Mine had a running model railway suspended from the ceiling!
retrogametech OMG thats what those controllers came from! i bought one of those controllers at the flea market here in the US thinking it was a 6 button but it wasnt!
retrogametech where did you find that cool clone
retrogametech I would buy one off u if you where able to give us a price iv been looking all over eBay for a project and I cant find any
retrogametech harry,the lcd screen is for the modchip thats in the xbox,its a optional purchase when you buy the chip
retrogametech This is awesome. How much do you think you can get for them?
retrogametech Cant be having that! :P
retrogametech Those are definitely the best types of deal. You can sometimes just tell from someones auction listing that they either dont care or have no idea how to properly test something :P This occasion was just a very nice surprise. I thought I was only buying faulty parts boards! XD
retrogametech You should look into getting an MVS :)
retrogametech Nice Video!!! Greetings from Germany!
retrogametech Hope you made a recent markup on them?
retrogametech hey martin i am trying to message you but it wont let me as you need to have me as a contact apparently now. i have added you to my address book. cheers
retrogametech Thanks dude. Pretty happy with the outcome :)
retrogametech Thanks. Just luck :P. I still need to put a few hours work into each console to get them 100. Otherwise Im pretty happy :)
retrogametech What a bargain! 2 almost (and now fully) working AES for that price is awesome!
retrogametech Can anyone please tell me why there seems to be an LCD display built in to the front of his Xbox?
retrogametech Can anyone please tell me why there seems to be an LCD display built in to the front of his Xbox?
retrogametech Not sure. But once theyre fully functional again they should be worth a lot more than what I paid. Theyll be a bare bones unitreplacement board.
retrogametech Nice buys there, I was going to ask, if you would consider selling the big on button and the slider (I found an AES at a car boot sales a few years ago, it was in pieces but as I found out it worked but was missing the two switches), no problem if you want to keep them, I also have a few ngage goodies I could trade if you prefer. Anyway, keep up the good work.
retrogametech I have a long video I can give you the link to about it if you are interested.
retrogametech I went to the pawn shops today, all offered 10 with controller and cables. They sell them for 60 : so Ill sell them on eBay Ill still come out on top anyway since I paid 23 for both :) Then after that if I cant sell both, I have some parts machines, so no biggie. Im not on many sites actually, is XS  XtremeSystems? If so Ive never been a member there.
retrogametech Thanks, dude! They still need a bit of work but still a good deal. I see you have internet again? :)
retrogametech Parcel force, and royal mail in a nutshell
retrogametech 480p is Standard Res and 240p is Low res. 720p is Hi res 1080p is Hi Definition 2k is Hidefinition 4k is UHD 8k is UHD. Shhhh...
retrogametech Not sure about GC titles but mine is softmodded and plays games Wii games from any region (from an external HDD).
retrogametech What was that game in the Dreamcast? I wonder if its something I would be interested in. Anyway, this was a cool little home project. I hope to do something like this myself when I finally have my own place.
retrogametech DoA 2 Japanese limited edition :). Awesome game!
retrogametech That 60Hz must be wonderful to have! I could never stand playing things in 50Hz.
retrogametech I designed it so it can be moved very easily as one complete unit. All the cabling is either bolted, screwed or fastened directly to the unit and cannot be moved or fall off. All I need to do is disconnectremove the TV and systems. All the wires and PSUs stay exactly where they are. I place the consoles in storage crates then secure the entire entertainment unit in wrapping film. Whole process takes about 20min max. Ive done it a few times now while redecorating. Huzzah! :)
retrogametech It makes a massive improvement to older systems on LCD Tvs. Check out a YouTuber called faginrs500. He has detailed vids on the subject with examples.
retrogametech Can you not put the Dreamcast VGA into the gonbes 8220 scalers input? Or does it only accept CGA resolutions there?
retrogametech Thanks. I should paint the broom handle to match :P
retrogametech Hey, I wanted to ask you what can I do to use my consoles with a VGA monitor. Maybe via component or SCART.
retrogametech Just the confusion that will now ensue most of the time nowadays lolol
retrogametech no warranty, ms i loathe ms custmer support and i dont wanna pay over 100 to fix it
retrogametech beautiful, isnt it? :P
retrogametech Oh my god I love the music in this video!
retrogametech Thanks. Im never quite satisfied with it though. Theres always something else that could be streamlinedimproved :P
retrogametech No, the only systems in my setup that benefit from that particular scaler and SLG are the Wii and Dreamcast. The rest I prefer TO directly hookup via RGB SCART :) . Maybe if I had something like an XRGBMini but I doubt Id invest that much money into one piece of hardware :P
retrogametech Ah. I see. Also, how do you hook up so many systems without causing electrical hazards? And why do you use those SCART switchers?
retrogametech Nice :) I need to get an SLG. How well does the cheapy scaler work when it actually scales the image up to 720p? In essence you are just using it as a pass through to the slg3000 right?
retrogametech Thanks. Couldnt believe it when I got the confirmation email on the controllers. I thought it was a mistake :P
retrogametech Haha, Im done with the challenges for now :P . Not too familiar with old Ataris so not sure what to suggest.
retrogametech game was closing in a shopping center next to me . My friend got about 20 ds games 1 2 pounds each .i missed out :C as i went the next day and it was fully closed
retrogametech I still need to complete 12! :P
retrogametech I like how you store your game boy color games. I have started a collection of the GB cartridges and I got some good deals from uk online store gamerascal. Check out my video if you wish.
retrogametech when did you get a slim
retrogametech great video! dead or alive has to be the only series of fighting games i cant get into : ive been trying to play it on the vita but i just cant figure it out for some reason, maybe its because im so used to capcom fighters like umvc3, and the main 3D game i play is tekken. i might get doa5 on the ps3 so i can play on my stick and maybe thatll help but its kinda hard to get used to the counter system...you should do a beginners guide video!
retrogametech Sure, Ill show them when I get round to doing my GBAGBC vids :)
retrogametech Excellent video thanks for sharing! Have you had any problems with your PS3? Ive been told at GameStop that those older, bigger models are more likely to have issues then the newer, slimmer PS3s. But, they are cheaper, so Ive thought about getting one.
retrogametech with what are you recording?
retrogametech we have the same tv stand
retrogametech with what are you recording?
retrogametech Thanks for watching :)
retrogametech Keep up the great work. Love the vids
retrogametech No, the menu on all Wiis is white by default. I modded mine when I got it a few years back :) . From what I remember its really easy to do. Theres a file you download and install which switches the colour for you.
retrogametech Thanks for the suggestion. Ill keep a look out for a copy. I was playing some ODST myself the other day. Id forgotten how many Firefly cast and references are in that game! :)
retrogametech you should try and find Metroid Prime Trilogy, you should be able to get it for 10 to 20 pounds, its 3 games in one and if you NEVER played the first 2, its the bast way to play
retrogametech Id love to see a DOA collection video, as well as GBA and Ngage stuff. I totally get the lack of motivation thing. You can try getting around it by arguing with yourself and hopefully wind up convincing yourself to make a video :P.
retrogametech make the old mvs in the wood case and use the new mvs some times
retrogametech DS cases? DS PAL cases are white plastic, much thicker, have no spine art and normally just plain title text. Theyre very bland looking. Thanks for the tip and thanks for watching :)
retrogametech Hey Great video! I was wondering if you knew how to make the 3DS battery last longer that what it usually does
retrogametech Make more videos of fixing defected consoles. Its just fun and interesting to watch.
retrogametech You Sir, are the fricken Ganesh of console repair!!
retrogametech Haha, well if I hadnt been under challenge conditions with my reputation on the line.... :P
retrogametech This was just a bit of a one off, sorry. I dont normally do repairs on other peoples hardware. Im also not too familiar with the Famicom so probably wouldnt be much help to you :P
retrogametech Awesome repair mate, another old classic get resurrected from the console graveyard.
retrogametech Siik vid as always :)
retrogametech You should do more of these videos.
retrogametech Haha, when I turned the board over for the first time and saw all the damage I did consider emailing Daz to say it was dead :P
retrogametech Your like a console doctor mate well impressed I have a dreamcast that is a tad messed up been trying to get it going for a while managed to get it to run for about 15 mins at a time and it conks out. Respect to a fellow scotsman lol
retrogametech Amazing work! Are you an experienced electrician or some sort? How did you learn to fix and mod items?
retrogametech Haha, not quite, but thanks! :)
retrogametech Your skills are amazing...I watch all your videos and you help me improving my fixing skills...Keep on the good job...
retrogametech Thanks. Fixing stuff is fun :)
retrogametech Great job,youre obviously very skilled in console repairs. Watching this video reminded me of a memory from my childhood.I went to an independent games shop in Leeds with my mum back in the early 90s and the shop was packed.Everyone was buying Japanese megadrives in boxes.But I just didnt understand why there was so much interest in the funny looking megadrives at the time. Now looking back I wonder if the shop had modified the megadrives internally to operate with PAL TVs.
retrogametech think wire glue (or any conductive glue) placed over the traces would have fixed it? Minus the capacitor that will obviously need a little work.
retrogametech Wow, youre lucky these boards were only double layered and didnt have any traces between the top and bottom sections otherwise that would be a dead board! Great work
retrogametech Hey Rtg fancy having a look at my Famicom? I live in Glasgow to and will pay for it of course
retrogametech Not seen to many of those but Id guess a lot of them just have dirtycorroded battery terminals.
retrogametech So many repair places wouldnt of bothered with that repair, but it shows just how skilled this repair was! Great stuff man, really looked like toast with those large cracks.
retrogametech Do u JTAG consoles locally?
retrogametech wow I think I posted on his original vid how difficult that would be to fix  impressive!
retrogametech Probably half and half to be honest, but if I play MS I usually only use the NGCD controller for some reason. Once, if I can ever find one that is, I get a AES controller that will be all I use pretty much.
retrogametech Thanks Luke. I couldnt find that tut you mentioned. Where abouts on the site is it and Ill throw a link into the description along with the others. Love these controllers! They have a really satisfying click to them and are perfectly shaped.
retrogametech Brilliant mate. I love what you do :)
retrogametech I miss my Neo Geo CDZ....
retrogametech You might not have noticed but Im a thrifty bastard when it comes to my gaming hobbies. I like to lag at least 5 years behind the current gen of consoles where prices are reasonable :P . So unless I find someone selling one for under 40 in the next few weeks, I doubt Ill be doing Wii U related vids any time soon, :P. Thanks for the suggestion though :)
retrogametech How would you approach the repair if you did not have any spare parts? Still possible?
retrogametech Thanks for your videos.I like them a lot.Do you use regular cleaning material for the plastic parts like liquid soap or an industrial cleaner?
retrogametech Awesome, heres a request if you can, There is a controller for Wii U you have probaly heard of called the Controller Pro U by inerworks. The Dpad doesnt work so well on alot of them and the reset button isnt big enough, you need a pin to reset it. Can you do a video showing how to fix the dpad if posible and how to make the reset button a bit bigger or easyer to press. It would help ALOT of people including my self. Thank you
retrogametech Breakers. Its a very basic but fun fighter :)
retrogametech do you need to wear an antistatic wrist band to fix consoles and other electronics?
retrogametech You can buy replacement switches, I think allelectronics or digikey has some that are the same size. what are the dimensions of the switches in mm?
retrogametech i noticed on alot of your videos you say you sell stuff on ebay i was just wondering if it would be possible to get a link so i can see what you have for sale? thanks :)
retrogametech Haha, yeah what a surprise, another ebay seller sending out filthy items. Maybe I should invest in a box of disposable latex gloves for these vids :P.
retrogametech First comment. Another great video!
retrogametech Haha, thanks. I appreciate you watching. Id post more if I wasnt so lazy!
retrogametech I checked this game out cuz of this vid and omg its amazing! As an 80s kid I thoroughly enjoyed it so thanks dude. Also good job on the case cover...very convincing :)
retrogametech Ive been enjoying this game immensely and this has just added to it. Awesome idea and it turned out well.
retrogametech damn it looks so legit. what printer do you use? ive wanted to print a few gba covers and a gameboy player disc custom cover
retrogametech You can install a small hardrive (or just a usb stick) into a megadrive cartridge and put the game on that, and then you would have a physical copy of the game. Quite a bit of work though.
retrogametech Thanks for the video :)
retrogametech Thanks for inspiring. I decided to make my own version for the Genesis. Check it out at my Deviant site: JoeyV104
retrogametech Thank. The game is great fun. Im sure youll enjoy it :)
retrogametech Great effort. Great idea and a great game.
retrogametech It would be pretty awesome to modify the case of a Sega Megadrive and put new hardware inside. Then make a cardridge with some USB stick inside which contains the actual installed game :P Then you basicly have your own next gen retro console for which you can make these bootlegs XD Atleast it would do more than sit at your shelf. Ive seen people do that with a NES so it should be doable with a Megadrive though its kinda small and tricky to get everything fitting. New project idea for you? :)
retrogametech I know you can buy the disc version for PC but a console release would be awesome. Preferably Mega Drive ).
retrogametech A nice idea. Executed well. Good stuff Martin
retrogametech Now that would be awesome! haha
retrogametech A nice idea. Executed well. Good stuff Martin
retrogametech Now that would be awesome! haha
retrogametech that is god damn cool. id like to do the same for apple jack.. my favourite xbox live game and one thats also quite retro..
retrogametech The question remains: Will you go as far as to port this game to the megadrive?
retrogametech Its loads of fun. Ive been burnt out on first person shooters for a while now. Stopped playing COD a few games back and found Halo 4BioShock Infinite really dull. Blood Dragon on the other hand has a very OTT pisstake, Duke Nukem, oldschool attitude and feel to it. Its a total blast to play :). The sound and art design are brilliant as well! Ive not played any of the Farcry games since the original one on Xbox. Never been a big fan.
retrogametech Haha, they should release it in the style of an old game like this or maybe in a VHS box. Its a great game :)
retrogametech Im slowly working through my list of projects, but that one is still about 10th on the list. My goal is to wait until it is considered retro.
retrogametech Nice work, love your videos and projects mate :)
retrogametech Haha, cool idea! Dont think Id have the skillpatience for that though :P
retrogametech Thats awesome man. They released a hard copy of it on PC here in Australia. I must say im loving both the game and the soundtrack.
retrogametech You ever have that cartridge which downloaded games every month or week? Know the name of that?
retrogametech The Dreamcast must be the first home console could play online out of the box. That apparently was one of the features they refused to remove despite being suggested to save manufacturing costs.
retrogametech Its funny how Sega were innovating in the 90s with online play, whereas Nintendo struggle even now in 2013... :)
retrogametech wow who knew that there was a Sega Modem before the Sega Channel? I learned something new today.
retrogametech Sega was ahead of its time. If only they are still around, no doubt would bring out a beast of a console for todays market.
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Wow, talk about ahead of its time. I had no idea about this modem or pack. I feel even more sorry that Sega is out of the hardware business. Hope they will be back someday...
retrogametech Wow that Cyberball game is awesome not only because of the game but because it had p2p multiplayer :D
retrogametech so THATS whats that hole was for!!!!!!
retrogametech Its great that the modem still works today. I wanna track down a broadband adapter for my Dreamcast and play some Phantasy Star Online :P
retrogametech Sega was so Great and Brave .
retrogametech Really informative video martin. Im a big fan of the mega drive too. As a kid it was one of my favourite consoles.
retrogametech because they had real experience making arcades from long time ago...
retrogametech Also, you should do a video talking about the Sega Pluto Saturn prototype It looked way cooler and thinner than the current saturn with everything the Saturn has except it had a built in Modem!
retrogametech This is so awsome! Cant wait too get one of these. Your Genesis megadrive is fucking solid bro..makes this old man smile! Peace and happy gameing
retrogametech I would if I had one :P
retrogametech if this woulda cought on big we would be in the Matrix by now. Damn you Sony and slowing down evolution
retrogametech im very jealous, you have the full sega power tower combo plus infrared controllers, cdx and now the megamodem. congratulations for show us this piece of history...finally know the reason of a hole in the back of Genesis. Regards!
retrogametech Way cool it still works! Cant say same thing with some of the newer discontinued online games.
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Do you know if the modem would work on a Genesis in North America? I have the Sega Channel adapter and I love the old Sega peripherals. Thanks!
retrogametech Awsome..i have been wanting too see you show this since your first video. This was even better than I anticipated thank you so much Bro.And keep up the great  interesting videos!
retrogametech ok so i get the collecting part. i do. i really really do. so collect them. but why dont people play the games on emulators more? it works so well now.. and its so simple...
retrogametech I see less and less of them already. Ebay used to be flooded with nice CRTs but not so much these days. Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Theres only a few reasons to be jealous of European gamers over US, like Shenmue 2, but SCART Tvs has to be the 1 reason, you guys have had quality RGB gaming for decades! I have a Sony PVM with RGB and a scartPVM adapter, Im never giving it up. :D
retrogametech Put the ugly sticker off. Lovely set! :)
retrogametech Im waiting for my RGB SCARTComponent converter since thats the only way to do it here. Plan to hook my MDMCD32x up via it. Cant wait to get rid of composite.
retrogametech imo same as this generations... last gen xbox vs ps2 xbox still had halo forza etc and some others but hes right on the saturn its the perfect 2d console overall its just it was wedged between past gen and next gen i think it would be 45th gen systems so it didnt work out so well and a pain to make games for it
retrogametech why have everything going through 1 plug and not being able to use others for other stuff then have separate plugs for everything? WTF? Do you like plugging different devices into the same composite input or something?
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Interesting stuff. I didnt know that. Maybe building your own cables would be cheaper?
retrogametech Hey Martin  I originally went for sony trinitron 15inch but found the screen a bit too small, then i went for BO 21inch it makes a huge difference, the scan lines are absolutely beautiful and much more defined due to the extra size, mainly use it with RGB connection for (snesmegadrive) but even the later consoles such as the PS2 also look really good,
retrogametech Really? The last couple of TVs Ive owned produced scanlines on lowres inputs from the likes of my Mega DriveMaster System. The other Sony Trinitron I still own produces scanlines by default when hooked up to the MVS or any other retro console. Theyre supposed to be there and I think they look beautiful :)
retrogametech They are definitely great little tellys. Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech I wish we stayed on CRT instead of LCDs, we could have a light weight flat CRT tvs and monitors.
retrogametech Its odd. I have another Trinitron from the same range only larger and it shows scanlines with all my systems by default confused. I think this smaller one must be upscaling or something like you suggest. It is pixel perfect and lovely to look at though! xD
retrogametech D: Never had a original Xbox? OH NOES!!!
retrogametech I dont imagine I will be. If it looks even half as good as what you showed Ill be amazed :)
retrogametech Do you get the same full SCART effect with the scart adapters that go on composite cables which were common in UK and here in Ireland?
retrogametech Thanks. I thought so too :)
retrogametech PAL N64 (except for model NUS001(FRA) ) doesnt have an RGB output. Only composite. Its crap in terms of quality but still you can connect to any PAL TV. SCART connection (and cables) always carry composite video and stereo audio alongside optional svideo and RGB video.
retrogametech It blew my geeky mind :P . Full control over my CRT? Yes please!
retrogametech I picked one these Tvs for 4 on a boot sale last year and its great for my gamecube and I use it for coin ops on Xbox and I prefer it to my LCD because these sound has a arcade feel to it. Also never knew about the service menu so thanks for that
retrogametech If you are using the SLG, Scaler and Sync Strike for another console (such as your Megadrive) do you need to run a separate audio lead for the sound? I dont have a Dreamcast (yet) but Id like to try this with a few other old consoles I have. Thanks.
retrogametech This was very interesting and I do agree that it looks better with scanlines, thanks for the video.
retrogametech A device dedicated to black lines is silly !
retrogametech Thanks :) . A quality Sony PVM looks like the optimum solution for getting the most out of these old systems :) . Imagine a wall of stacked PVMs! One for each console :P
retrogametech RetroGameTech, all youre missing is the scaler and the syncstrike. Cheers!
retrogametech Yeah games like DoA arent as noticeable. I generally turn the scanlines down so they arent as intense for those games. It does however add a little extra depth and the menustext really benefit from it.
retrogametech you might want to have a look at SLGinaBox and put a scart multiplicator on it.
retrogametech oh I know, but I have all the older systems as well, was thinking of the Genesis, as it does not want to play nice with my AV to VGA converter p
retrogametech RGB makes a really big difference IMO. Its so nice to be able to clearly see each individual pixel in a sprite. And the added colour vibrancy is stunning :) . Haha, I shot, edited and uploaded this vid twice before I was happy with it. It was really tricky to accurately capture and give a sense of what is seen with the naked eye. Its good to hear people like what they see. Cheers, Luke!
retrogametech Silly me! Ive watched it when you released the video and today I remembered to comment and didnt remembered that you had the full kit! Is it possible to connect an NES using composite ( Scart NES are somewhat rare and expensive!) to the scaler and get image? I plan to connect all of my consoles to the Kit and I dont know if Im able to connect the NES. I use an HP W2408H monitor for my recent consoles. Cheers!
retrogametech Thanks :) . There are other devices like the XRGBmini that do a better job  are an allinone solution. But those can get pretty damn expensive. The SLG is a very nice little low budget alternative :) . I definitely think everyone who has a Dreamcast should own a VGA box! Makes games looks amazing :)
retrogametech It really gives 2D games a nice arcady look :D . Thanks for watching!
retrogametech Retrogametech, just bought a dreamcast and loving every minute. It makes a fair noise when reading discs. I assume that if I opened it up and greased its cogs and lazer running track it might help, but what grease would you advise?
retrogametech It really gives 2D games a nice arcady look :D . Thanks for watching!
retrogametech Sounds cool. On some consoles and games I like the clean blocky look better. On others I prefer the scanlines. Its all down to personal preference I suppose. Its nice to have the option though :)
retrogametech If you use this would a lightgun work with a lcd?
retrogametech lol, I search SLG 3000 on Ebay and Amazon, and all I get is fire trucks..
retrogametech I didnt think that 480p games would benefit from scanlines but it does provide a kind of fake antialiasing effect that works surprisingly well.
retrogametech i cant remember them being this pronounced either.
retrogametech I never thought anybody would want the lines on their TV, then again it does add that Nostalgic feeling.
retrogametech Itll definitely help but the DC is well known for having a very distinct sounding and noisy drive regardless. I use a good quality bike grease on mine. But any light mechanical grease is fine :) . Just dont use too much :P
retrogametech Yea if you have the space.. then a bulky crt is the more sensible road.. u could probably get a nice crt for cheaper than the actual SLG3000 btw :p
retrogametech i have a bunch of xbox 360 video games
retrogametech It looks great on 15kHz 240p stuff, but highresolution 480P games like DOA never had visible scanlines (and neither do Naomi arcade monitors) so the gadget is making it less defined. Look at the bottom of the white garment on DOA (10:02). Theres a 4 pixel slant on the normal VGA output, theres only 2 pixels with the scaline generator as its overwritten every other line of genuine detail with a black line. So the illusion of more detail is actually a reduction in detail by 50.
retrogametech The effect comes across quite well on YouTube. Its encouraging that we will be able to preserve the arcade look long after the CRTs have all died.
retrogametech So...what happens if another retro enthusiast has a modem? Could you theoretically have a peer to peer game if someone else had the working hardware?
retrogametech So what happens if you answer the phone?
retrogametech Back in 1990! Crazy :P
retrogametech HAHA that is awesome.
retrogametech pure AWESOME !! I never new that was around for a mega drive! well dine finding it bro! :)
retrogametech Just wondering, did the Mega Drive even have a microphone attachment? I know it was just for fun, but if there was no microphone for it how would it work xD Keep up the good vids!
retrogametech Wow old retro still surprises me :)
retrogametech I was hoping a voice would tell you the location of the Dreamcast 2 :D
retrogametech Excellent response! I lold. If I gave you my number, would you call me via the MD? :D
retrogametech wow that megadrive is seriously hooked up. could you plug anything else into it?
retrogametech :D nice, is there anything the mega drive cannot do?
retrogametech Try calling an iPhone with that thing!
retrogametech Incredible that you managed to make the Genesis modem work! I cant even manage to get my Dreamcast online for Phantasy Star Online...how can you tell if you have a phone line in your house?
retrogametech Madness???? This... is... SEGA!
retrogametech Ive never heard of this module before... do you plan on making a video about it. I would be curious to see what it really was in the day. Seems pretty inovative for the time.
retrogametech Netlink for Saturn still works too. Do you have a Netlink around that you could mess with on camera? Still regret selling it.
retrogametech you must have been bored as hell to come up with this video lol
retrogametech there is a singularity and all sega products are sucked into the black hole left
retrogametech Yeaa its always good to have some spare SIMs hanging around though my new 02 ones have an expiry date slaps 02 :( I am guessing they will still bring NGages to life after that though :) Is your NGage the one where you talk to the mobile sideways or is that the other version?
retrogametech Now you just need the karaoke add on. :)
retrogametech hey thanks for uplloading the vids on console repair it gave me the courage to say whats the worst that could happen hurt the plastic and i went and repaired 1 of my ps2s i could nt bring my self to chuck away because it was my first on and it works a charm
retrogametech HAHahahaha. Calling MEGA DRIVE funniest thing Ive ever seen calling :p nice stuff man.
retrogametech Wow you found a practical use for the NGage. Can the modem be used on the Sega cdx?
retrogametech DUDE YOURE DRIVING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD!
retrogametech I do not inow for certin but I live in  and we have over 200 cm this year in certain spots.
retrogametech Yeah you guys dont classify it as having even snowed unless its several feet deep! :P
retrogametech In the central west we dont really get much. Its a bit too mild down here. It can get heavy at times but then its usually gone again within a day or 2. Compared to the north or colder countries its nothing. Its rare to get genuinely snowed in here :P
retrogametech What a great video. I love all these videos showing off the beauty of Scotland.
retrogametech not because of the roads, lol, because of the snow on the roads
retrogametech Where is this , I know its Scotland ( Im from strathaven) so ill probably known where this is.
retrogametech Great vid, great road :)
retrogametech Curse you global warming! Oh its snowing, nevermind... Only time Ive ditched my car was on a sleet covered road so be careful.
retrogametech PlayStation 4 graphics, Believe!
retrogametech Looks like most of my early morning drives to work. I use both sides of the road.
retrogametech Thats a lovely drive youve got there. Even in the US, we are getting crazy weather like that. Supposedly snowed somewhere here in Arkansas the other day.
retrogametech Ugh... Your country has bad draw distance.
retrogametech Cool vid. It looked you were diving in some of the corners Mansell ) What car were you driving may I ask?
retrogametech He would have made a killing back in the RROD days.
retrogametech It usually always that same top ribbon cable, Fix quite a few of them, just by reseating the cables .
retrogametech Hi RetroGameTech, I would like to ask if it is possible to reseat the ribbon cables just by unscrewing the top screen? I dont wish to mess with the motherboard at the bottom screen
retrogametech The ebay seller was from doncaster near me :) great vids
retrogametech I got a metalic blue for chrismis (Forgot how to spell) And the whole thing inside was smashed and i just got it. Atleast i got a metalic red for a free refund.
retrogametech How did you learn how to fix Nintendo systems or any system
retrogametech Im going to start listing all of my values in pesos from now on.
retrogametech i have a canon ixus 220 hs, i bought it for either 150 or 250 but i was shooting an outdoor scene i tripped and fell on the grass and the lens is bent, ill sell it to you if you want. it has a great slow motion feature. used it goes for around 80  90 so if you do get it itd be a great deal on your part. interested?
retrogametech The last question sorry ihave capacitor new one same the old but new can i change the exploding one with the new
retrogametech the backlight of my touch screen is not working on my 3ds, it works perfectly fine if you apply pressure to the bottom left of the screen. any suggestions?
retrogametech where did you learn how to repair stuff?
retrogametech can i buy one of the ds lites?
retrogametech where did you learn how to repair stuff?
retrogametech These videos are like forensics with game consoles.
retrogametech Which cable was it actually?
retrogametech how much for the ds lites?
retrogametech Oh god, the gymnastics required to handle the two in the DSi XL was enough to drive me nuts. I have a few DS Lite repairs coming up and I was relieved to find that they also have one ribbon and a bit more room to route it.
retrogametech I hate taking apart the 3DS. Those ribbon cables are such a pain to get seated properly. Managed to make a working one from 2 broken ones from ebay (one had been dipped in a cup of tea and the other had a smashed top screen) and have another broken one in my drawer that fell in the sea that I hope to fix. I already cleaned all the salt out of it and cleaned the contacts with isopropyl but am waiting for a charger to arrive from Ebay.
retrogametech Nice one, very clever!
retrogametech I love those lime green DSLs! I have one myself :). They look even coolervibrant in real life!
retrogametech In a Scottish accent: Thenks fuhr teking the tame to meking us these veedeohs
retrogametech I dont know why but I LOVE your vids man, good job with this one...
retrogametech damn if the guy who sold this watched this, hed be pissed lol
retrogametech You should get one of these things. Fix it. Return it to the seller for a refund. Put a note in the box saying that you fixed it, and for them to enjoy their once broken hardware. They will be so surprised and grateful. You would REALLY make someones day.
retrogametech Got to love the new Scottish money :D Us English still have boring money
retrogametech Help not working this my 3ds
retrogametech I also have a complete NGage collection including the full download of Payload, a dl only game which cost, I think, GBP14 to get the serial number to unlock the game fully.
retrogametech Great collection, well done mate. Im a fellow collector, who has begun collecting 5 years after selling on an almost entire collection of games, prerelease demos and other swag. Finding it incredibly different now to collect again. One question, where did you get the black QD fascia? Id love one of those.
retrogametech i have a ngage bag that i got in 2005 :D, i still got my ngage i love that phone its a beast!
retrogametech put ur channel back to normal!!!
retrogametech the Tiger Woods game originally came from Argos........the 7 digit order number on the front gives it away lol
retrogametech dud, good clolection, but you still dont have all of them. There were 77 games made. My favrite is Civialization and Myst.
retrogametech isnt there a Sims game for the ngage?
retrogametech Congratulations Martin! Must feel great to finally track down that final game, well done! :D
retrogametech Not for the original NGage gamephone. Nokia kept and continued to use the NGage brand for its mobile games long after the Taco and QD were discontinued. It would most likely be a download only game released for one of their later smartphones.
retrogametech I myself am trying to get hold of a boxed console. You got any spare lol
retrogametech I really wanna see the sims bustin out on ngage! :D
retrogametech Collin mcrea rally 2005
retrogametech great work on collecting them all, could you maybe do a vid with your top 5 best games  top 5 worst games???  i love to see sega rally! love that game  would also love to see it shat out the arse of the ngage P
retrogametech also would like to see gameplay for anyone honestly, especially ones that use a lot of 3d graphics as opposed to 2d.
retrogametech do some call of duty n gage gameplay
retrogametech I wanna see ngage gameplay
retrogametech Can you still play these online?
retrogametech search images ngage qd accessories in google and you will see the dual slot.. theres alot of rare ones like the speaker and the wired headset..
retrogametech seriously, i didnt do anything
retrogametech Do you use an NGage as your actual phone?
retrogametech This is awesome. Well done. I am moving to Scotland soon ( Uni ), I would be honoured to visit your game room.
retrogametech How much does an ngage roughly cost?
retrogametech I love your explanation at the end, there. People ask me why I collect games and keep some of them sealed and they cant understand it. Im trying to achieve a full Sonic PAL CiB collection which is starting to take up a lot of room, but I think itll be worth it in the end. Love your collection and pickup videos reminds me Im not the only one. Haha
retrogametech The cards look like the ps vita game cards
retrogametech A complete NGage collection!!! Its awesome!!! Congratulations! Now you can start reviewing some of this games, maybe foucusing on the exclusives. I played some of the early games like Tomb Raider (great port), Sonic N (an poor port of Sonic Advance) and Super Monkey Ball (another poor port from the GBA) but I never manage to play the exclusives :(
retrogametech I love the thumbsticks but my fps FREEKS elite I have them on
retrogametech FREEKS fuck you autocorrect
retrogametech any hints on how to fix thumbstick controller drift? my halo 4 controllers left stick is walking to the right, and my halo reach controller is pulling to the front too :(.
retrogametech Or as I like to call it, Salty Chew. actually made myself a little ill there
retrogametech Definitely invest in a wired controler but you CAN clean out the dried battery acid if youre careful and do it right.
retrogametech At least theres not a couple decades worth of congealed sweat and grim to deal with! :P
retrogametech Yeah the 360s Dpad is its only weakness IMO. Hope they sort it out for the next gen :)
retrogametech I might upgrade From my old controller to one of these.
retrogametech Where did you get that remote? I know that they sold the limited edition Halo 4 Xbox 360s here in the US. I bought the Gears of War 3 limited edition Xbox 360 which came with the same type of remote but with different art work.
retrogametech good to know. Ill need to do this for one of my controllers but for less of a mod and more of the old sticks grips are fading
retrogametech Ive been building and customizing 360 controllers for a few years now. Ive never seen an aftermarket casekit or controller that even came close to the quality of official Microsoft stuff. The build quality and feel are never quite right. With controllers youre always best sticking to official OEM.
retrogametech Hey man, Ive been watching your videos for some time. Always looking forward to an upload from you! Anyways Ive been wondering, where do you go to buy all your consoles and games? Do you just use Ebay? Ive been wanting to get into fixing up consoles, and youve helped motivate that for me! So thanks!
retrogametech Look killer, mate! Original Xbox DPads were CRAP!
retrogametech Nice stuff, I didnt know the controller was transparent, quickly looking at it you dont notice. Great video as always man!
retrogametech I mentioned some of the differences in the video description and I think theres an online wiki about it on the fan site :) . And yes, Kasumi is full frontal neked in the Japanese LE intro :P . Well, shes in some sort of water bubble thing but you can see everything ahem.
retrogametech I was playing the 3DS version last night, it definitely seems very similar to this. I made a 3DS from parts of broken ones I bought on eBay after being inspired by your lets repair videos :)
retrogametech nice vid Martin! Do you know the differences beteween the LE version of DOA2 (japan) and the regular version? I remember when it came out there were all sorts of rumors (naked Kasumi alpha) but I dont think it was ever clarified online. Ive owned the regular japan import (DC) as well as the PS2 hardcore version. I think my fave is the xbox ultimate version.
retrogametech cant find this game :(
retrogametech such an easy game but it is good fun.
retrogametech I still love this game, this was fun to watch Martin. tengu always gave a hard time, hate that guy...lol
retrogametech Thanks Luke! Thats what I was aiming for so Im glad the vid came across in that way and you enjoyed it :) . Haha, I was genuinely surprised Tengu didnt put up more of a fight! Usually he hands me my ass a good 4 or 5 times before I finally beat the game. I think I got lucky! haha Thanks for watching!
retrogametech Its one of those game like Streets Of Rage where I never seem to get tired of playing it. Weirdly satisfying :)
retrogametech Cool vid mate. Re the SLG 3000, can it take multiple inputs or only one at a time? Im interested in one but do not want the hassle of switching between consoles when using it. Thanks
retrogametech I agree. The DC version does look better, and runs at a silkysmooth 60fps.
retrogametech Haha, yeah its the Japanese version. I cant take the English voice acting on the others :P . Its nice they give you the option on later games to choose which you prefer.
retrogametech Me and my friend joked about fighting games. We said Dead Or Alive was on the leading edge of Jiggle Physics and was a fighting game second. We were Street Fighter nerds. However sense I started playing DoAD for the 3ds I have taken a liking to the series. It lacks that street fighter feel, but it has an unbelievable polish.
retrogametech Whats your opinion on Dead or Alive 2 Ultimate for Xbox? What do you think of the modern Ninja Gaiden games, since they share a connection?
retrogametech I know, Ive got all the versions :P. Im a DoA freak, lol
retrogametech ..using the SLG. Im really interested to see how Mega Drive emulation will look when combined with SLG and the Dreamcasts VGA 480p output. Will test it out soon! Im going to try and make a video about my thoughts on the issue in the coming weeks. So far I really like the SLG3000 but only when used with the DC and with the scan line intensity set VERY low.
retrogametech I still have this game, but the disc doesnt work anymore. Well, not this exact version, I have the NA release. My friend had (probably still has) DOA2: Hardcore for PS2, and whenever we got together, wed challenge each other. I preferred HayateEin, while he went with Ayane.The bonus features that the PS2 version had were image galleries with the same images as the Dreamcast version had when you put the disc in a PC. I dont know if it maybe had more outfits. I unlocked them all on my game.
retrogametech I do have a capture card thing but I dont like using it. I think they give a less personal feel to these type of videos. Theyre also a lot more work to use (extra editing, capturing voice audio, equipment to set up etc).
retrogametech I actually prefer this style of vid to using a capture device. More personal and much easier to shooteditupload :P
retrogametech One of my favourites :)
retrogametech Not so much high standards, more just genuine effort and thought ) I dont even like the DoA games but you made this entertaining to watch so that makes it a success to me!
retrogametech I cant believe you dont have a video capturing device, someone should send you one
retrogametech I was a little surprised myself :P . I played it again the next day and it took several attempts just to get past the second to last character. Just luck I suppose :) .
retrogametech Ive seen too many 80s action movies so I recognised that dopey voice of his straight away. I had a good chuckle when I saw the workout tape lol
retrogametech Those are probably hatched markings vehicles are supposed to stay off them in order to keep space between the lanes.
retrogametech I can watch that kind of thing till the cows come home :)
retrogametech Its the perfect runabout for nipping out to Sainsburys :P
retrogametech Thanks for bringing me to the attention of Power Glove. Their Maximum Potential track with samples from a Dolph Lundgren 80s workout tape is the stuff of awesomeness.
retrogametech Thanks, glad you liked it. I love driving at night, too. Very early morning is fun too. Zero traffic so you get the roads to yourself :)
retrogametech Cool video. Kind of reminded me of MSR on the Dreamcast.
retrogametech Haha, I used to love watching that show.
retrogametech Ya, have you seen Worlds Dumbest Criminals? And i thought i laughed loud, bet the cops that watch the security footage laugh as well haha.
retrogametech Power Glove are most definitely worthy of a listen! :) Ive been looking for a good excuse to use one of their tunes in a vid for ages :P. I freakin love the synth sound and electronic drum fills they use! xD Good luck with the theory! Its extremely easy so dont sweat it. Driving is great fun, just wish it wasnt so damn expensive :(
retrogametech What are the zigzaggy lines on the sides of the roads?
retrogametech The guy in the corsa in front for a while looks dodgy
retrogametech Are you driving the Batmobile? :)
retrogametech Thanks. Ive actually been watching a few Swedish YouTubers do driving vids recently. Looks like a beautiful country! Id love to visit some day.
retrogametech wait for the meteorite itll happen someday. leave the dash cam on :D
retrogametech Was that Hamilton you were in by any chance? :O
retrogametech Thanks! Glad you liked it :)
retrogametech The three best sources are as follows: eBay (just search for DMG backlight) kitschbent . com (offers both single color backlights and ones with an RGB LED to allow for different colors to be selected) nonelectronics . com (Nonfinite is similar to Kitsch)
retrogametech No, you can only frontlight those unfortunately.
retrogametech whats your honest thoughts on a original gameboy with backlight? do you get good contrast or is it washed out? also does it show up all the dust etc? would you recomend it or not?
retrogametech thanks for the reply i just rewatched the vid does the screen look faded like it does in the vid or in person is ther more contrast? and what would you say is the best color back lit screen? are other colors better suited? thanks
retrogametech you can solder to the 2 points dirrectly below the ribbon cable at the bottom
retrogametech Those are 2 of the easiest points youll find.
retrogametech Theres no other logical explanation, got to be magic! xD
retrogametech Search YT for game gear ds backlight P
retrogametech I remember that video of yours, Ill just have to dig though the mountain of broken ds screens i have LOL thank you
retrogametech Would you be able to use one of the late model, backlit SPs to replace an original GBA or even GBC screen for the backlight?
retrogametech Shame it doesnt appear big enough for a game gear screen
retrogametech Whats the best way to clean the adhesive off the back of the screen? I tried cue tips but they left little pieces of fuzz.
retrogametech Id rather desolder the cables, less of a danger to destroy such a nostalgic thing.
retrogametech Oldie but goodies! As love old fashioned stuff like this!
retrogametech where did you get the clear gameboy shells?
retrogametech where did you get the clear gameboy shells?
retrogametech I mean, a discreet front lighting or some kind.
retrogametech hi do you do these for customers? i would like this done to my gameboy can you pm me? im in uk
retrogametech Hi i cant find these backlight kits on ebay? What are they called?
retrogametech Hi, nice vid! I want to make this mod, but have one doubt. The original screen is super when playing outside, even better with direct sunlight, will I lose this funktion if I switch to backlight screen? (I hade many DS and PSP consoles and they are unplayeble in direct sunlight...)
retrogametech the game image looks a little washed out and faded when lighted is that how it looks in person?
retrogametech Well this next on the list once Im modding my gbc.
retrogametech I havent tested it but I would imagine it is between 45V
retrogametech It works really well. I definitely recommend giving it go.
retrogametech You have backlights on the brain! xD
retrogametech Im assuming battery life takes a serious hit? Looks awesome though.
retrogametech So we can use the same method for Game  Watchs?
retrogametech there was going to be one. there are pictures of it
retrogametech Thanks. I think Ill try it on a blue and classic white VMU next. I do like the transparent green, though :)
retrogametech There was a piece of homebrew that let you export and import your vmu files over the serial port or ethernet. Also let you reformat the VMU to use the extra 40 blocks of unused space.
retrogametech Very cool! I might have to try this mod soon...
retrogametech oh lol, well then I have a video to watch later
retrogametech it was probably not used for years so Im not sure if with more usage itll stop doing that or if it will get to the point to where it stays like that and ruins the screen. I bought some batteries for it so that way the little icons will light up since a lot of the ink or whatever built up the most around those. Im curious as if it anyone else has ever had that happen. If it keeps happening Ill post a video of it on my channel.
retrogametech I actually did a video about that a while back :P
retrogametech Could you sell me one of these please???
retrogametech Thanks Thomas! Yeah, I was really interested to see how it all went together. That video by engineerguy I linked to in the description is a good watch if youre interested :)
retrogametech I kinda thought so too :P
retrogametech great mod, interesting idea to use the back light from a broken DS.... wonder if that same back light would work on a GameGear.....I need to look into that. How is the battery light? as even without this mod, the lifespan of VMU batteries are not long.
retrogametech Man how great and ahead of there time was the dreamcast btw love the Doa music
retrogametech you know, haters have no place in the retro world, retro is retro, rather it be sega or nintendo.
retrogametech great work martin , awesome stuff as allways! i still not found a dreamcast! still got the vmu! ready! lol )
retrogametech Damn, thats pretty sweet.
retrogametech That is truly impressive. I dont think I have one VMU that still has working batteries.
retrogametech Thanks. Its not overly complicated, just really fiddly work :P
retrogametech sadly you cannot backlight a gameboy color, as the lcd isnt transparent anymore. for gbc only frontlighting works.
retrogametech Greaselubricate the rails the laser assembly is on, that and installing a quieter case fan. Definitely greasing the rails as it made a massive difference for me.
retrogametech Very cool, I never had a VMU in the Dreamcast days. Funny how the WiiU essentially has the 2013 version of the idea.
retrogametech You should have put a switch on it to turn the light on and off. Otherwise, AWESOME!
retrogametech Lol, so true! :P . Now I get to create a rechargeable VMU hack xD
retrogametech you know what would be an excellent mod? something that gives the vmu some decent battery life.
retrogametech Wow, good memory, lol. Id totally forgotten about that. That was a console someone sent me to be modded with a region free BIOS. Theyd imported it from the US if I remember correctly.
retrogametech Thanks dude. Yeah the music is from a Dreamcast game. Its BGM from DoA2 :) . One of my favorites.
retrogametech Why? The Ps3 thumb sticks are fine. Plus, The Wii thumbsticks are better than the GC thumbsticks.
retrogametech That was an amazing deal! Awesome find and awesome video.
retrogametech where did you get the green mat? thanks
retrogametech ic102 has been replaced and the QFP with the mod lead coming off it is the original and is machine placed, the chip with gull wing leads are deffo try joints and should be reflowd. best bet is using a flux pen on the leads and using a hot air pencil to go over the joints, good work on bringing it back to life! :)
retrogametech Im getting worried , they sell brand new ones like that for 75 pound on ebay are they faulty ?
retrogametech Thanks. Fixing a lot of these old systems is generally easier than you might think )
retrogametech Game suggestions: Devils Crush  Great pinball game Military Madness  Nice little war game, not too complex Space Harrier  Pretty good port Before spending a lot of money on games, Id suggest that you download an emulator like TurboEngine and try them out. Then youll know which ones youll like.
retrogametech Id love to get some suggestions of games I should try.  the one you got is one of the best there is for the system. Id also recommend Keith Courage in Alpha Zones (platformer came bundled in some North American releases) and Victory Run (driving).
retrogametech can i steal all your consoles please 00
retrogametech Thanks! Luckily it was a pretty simple fix :)
retrogametech Good job. Hey even if you couldnt get it working it would have been worth if for the box and the housing of that TG16
retrogametech Thats cool that you got a fair price and was able to fix it up. I think its interesting to see the inside of a video game console. That I wouldnt have the patience to fix them like you have. XD
retrogametech Its not that bad but the PCEngine is a lot nicer looking. The TurboGrafx was made unnecessarily large to cater to western consumers. Bigger is better and all that.
retrogametech Was that Sony chip part of the sound system by any chance? Seen a very similar looking chip in my stereo.
retrogametech Good video just wondering if you ever made a video for replacing a fuse in a nintendo ds lite with no power. thanks
retrogametech After watching your latest vid I now want a white Japanese PCEngine! Damn you! lol Its a real shame these UK versions were gimped with 50Hz.
retrogametech I think it was maybe a region mod gone wrong. Ill probably end up region modding it properly and also install a proper RGB output :)
retrogametech Damn! A TG16 for 11.50 pounds? Thats an epic deal indeed.
retrogametech Have you ended up getting any more TG games?
retrogametech what exactly makes a cartridge a bootleg copy? is it the same rom copied to a different (illegal produced and distributed) cartridge??? ....i.e. does it have the same SNK logo ingame or anything?
retrogametech oh that makes sense. Thanks for the reply. Folks starting out in collecting mvs should google the words gotwalls  mvs. This site has saved by butt many times.
retrogametech You wouldnt have been laughing had you smelled them before they got cleaned up! :P
retrogametech I love the fact that you stacked all Yu suzuki games together. Seems logic for me
retrogametech Hey Martin! Nice pick ups. Subscribed to your channel not so long ago and was surprised to find out that youre a fan of DOA series. Yeah, same here and they are nice games. 1 for showcase of your entire DOA collection as someone mentioned here before. By the way whats your opinion on the latest game in the series? I personally find it pretty much ok game!
retrogametech This clamshell type case was also used for official PS1 rental versions and some PS1 promos. I really would have wished that most dreamcast games whould have come in these cases instead of those stupid plastic cases, that are so fragile and really difficult to replace as there are almost no repro versions made for them.
retrogametech Great pick ups! One day you should show your entire DoA collection. That bundle PAL DoA2 must be quite rare... How did you spot that Metal Slug was a bootleg?
retrogametech Nice fabric cutting board lol
retrogametech That explains why people consolize MVS systems.
retrogametech seems like it would be more work than its worth. Ive seen MVS boards, many rom chips. would have to be desoldered and then all that
retrogametech the bundle copy of dead or alive 2 would be one that came with the dreamcast console it probably would have had an extra controller with it too you know like if you buy kinect you get kinect adventures free. hope that helps martin.
retrogametech Some fantastic pick ups there martin. I take it with that metal slug footage you showed us, you have the cmvs almost finished? Cant wait to see it. At least you will have plenty of things to keep you busy when all this snow hits us this weekend.
retrogametech U need more Saturn games dude!
retrogametech Been waiting for a pickup video :)
retrogametech the clone MD cost 30usd free world wide shipping for a brand new one its boxed ect
retrogametech Oh and as an offtopic question: Ive ordered a Japanese Mega Drive model 1 just yesterday and while Im waiting for it I started wondering whether a European AC adaptor would fit it or should I use some sort of power convertor?
retrogametech for some reason I LOLd when you said the headphones smelled a bit suspicious.
retrogametech hi martin great pick ups thhose massive mvs carts are soo cool! , and the art work on jap megadrive32x carts look so much cooler, great stuff :)
retrogametech ROCKET LAUNCHEEERRRRRR
retrogametech I like it! Cool idea but it is seams like you spent alot of time and money in to this project, excuse my ignorance but couldnt you have fit a micro SD port insted!?
retrogametech Ah man trip world! I love that game :3
retrogametech You should sell them 10 dollars for card and 5 for roms
retrogametech hi I wonder if you have tried using a sd card entry in cartridge game boy color
retrogametech they are not worth 50 they are worth at the max 20
retrogametech OH! Those look like the tubs from Morrisons!
retrogametech Thanks. Ive posted links in the description that have lots of info on the subject. Theres also a YouTuber called Gerry OBrien whos already done some pretty good tutorials on making flashcarts :) . I think a GBA version would probably be too expensive and complicated for me. Ill stick with my EZFlash for that system :P
retrogametech I seriously doubt it. They have tons of companies that are attempting to work on it. I doubt he would even know where to start. Besides that flash cart is 80 bucks. Not including shipping and such. Not worth it to even buy it yet.
retrogametech with this project can you also flash pc bios chips to if so that will save us a lot of time and will be easy to use i will try to find a programme that dos PC bios flashing to
retrogametech very nice job! can you flash multiple games to those chips? that flash board thingy looks insanely complicated to a noob like me lol
retrogametech Thanks dude! But I mostly just follow tutorials or use info other people have discoveredposted online. Soldering isnt too difficult to learn either :P
retrogametech How do you know all this stuff dude?
retrogametech looks very similar to mine. you may want to consider putting more sram onto the cart. maizemods.blogspot.com
retrogametech How do u do this for GBA? Can u do a tutorial on it?
retrogametech Haha, I think thats probably where I got it. Well spotted!
retrogametech Haha, I think thats probably where I got it. Well spotted!
retrogametech ive been thinking about doing this myself, but with nes and mega drive games. seems to get complicated with the nes carts, being you have to find donor carts. if you start doing more repos id definitely like to see vid on them! )
retrogametech what do you do for a living ?
retrogametech Just researching the stuff that interests me :P .Theres loads of info floating about the interwebs :)
retrogametech thanks for sharing this awesome project!!
retrogametech this works like the new Gateway 3ds flash cart
retrogametech Thanks Ed. Good to hear from you too! Xmasnew year was a busy time! Been taking a bit of a break from making vids. Catching up on some projects and actually playing my games :)
retrogametech I wanted to do this before too. I have found some schematics to do it and bought everything that needed for 5 carts  was a lot of money. The problem is the flash chip. There is only 1 company that sells it but only in giant packs and that is a whole lot money I cant afford... :(
retrogametech i bet this video was disliked by the guy who made that sonic game
retrogametech Cool, Ive still to try out LSDJ on mine. It looks complicated! haha
retrogametech I wanted to put some ROMs on cartridges, but I want the thing to look authentic, and not be a regular sd flashcart. I was wondering where the chips and flasher could be purchased so that I could try to flash a chip, and install it in a cartridge
retrogametech I really want to flash Earthbound to a Mother 2 cart. Do you think this is possible?
retrogametech The game probably has the common problem of the battery dieing in which case you just need to solder in a new one
retrogametech could you maybe fix my snes mini. it wont power up
retrogametech Just to inform ya dude,gb system is not trash,its one of the most succseed nintendos console system,one of the nest portable console ever made in the age of its release
retrogametech Nice job! Love the videos! What do you use for cleaning the battery corrosion? I havent been able to find something that works well.
retrogametech You are a wizard ! Where did you study ?
retrogametech Liked and Subscribed. Thank you
retrogametech The previous owner is no longer happy about the money he gained.
retrogametech then why everyone calling them DMG? sorry for my ignorance...
retrogametech i dit bought 2 gameboys for 10 euros excluding shipping costs. after i had cleaned them,they work,however by 1 of the gameboys 1 battery connection has been rust,i tryed to remove that rust with sandpaper but it doesnt work. by the other gameboy it does work via batterys but one slight move and the gameboy shuts off. they both work with adaptor. they both are also yellowish.
retrogametech anyone noticed thanks nerd on the package?
retrogametech heard of Gameboy DMG power adapter? micro USB 2 DMG power
retrogametech RetroGameTech, was the repairing process of this GameBoy enjoyable in the sense that the end result was well worth it?
retrogametech I love your vids. Keep up the good work.
retrogametech Whats the problem? It might be a problem with your console.
retrogametech this is a cool channel subscribes
retrogametech I have a new game boy green, can anyone want?
retrogametech Ive recently run into my old gameboy and it seems to have the same corrosion issue this yours did. What did you use to get rid of the corrosionclean the battery port?
retrogametech dude your videos kick ass! dont stop, I always look forward to them
retrogametech would you ever do a vid on repairing a game boy advance sp???
retrogametech thank you for showing me how to repair these! your work has inspired me to want to go buy a box of non working gameboys off ebay and see how many working ones I can build.
retrogametech I was drinking IrnBru while i was watching this!
retrogametech no it had to be changed because of false advertising
retrogametech Irn Bru is so popular in Scotland, that its the only country in the world where coca cola isnt the number one soda!
retrogametech Lots of mystery Christmas packages going around, love it. Great stuff guys! )
retrogametech Awesome! Ive always wondered if it was OK to ship IRNBRU, so I can send some to my cousins in Canada :D
retrogametech Ill give it a shot bro. Thanks a lot for the greetings, I wish you a happy time around the new year as well man
retrogametech I think Martin really likes you.
retrogametech why is text on the tape dutch?
retrogametech interesting stuff man for sure. Ill try a bit of it later.
retrogametech Haggis is honestly one of scotlands gems you should try it
retrogametech Thanks bro, I appreciate that you thought of me man :) dont go out of your way bro :)
retrogametech Haha, awesome gift Martin. Guessing youll be responsible for Lukes sugar high :p
retrogametech He must work over at walmart or something, looks like the 30 layers of wrap on a dvd case
retrogametech much love from europe xD
retrogametech I am living in Singapore ang mo kio ave 10 street 44 block 467 level 8 08 1010
retrogametech irn bru, awesome drink :)
retrogametech lol, thanks for the offer bro, I appreciate it. no need to send anything though. the fact that you are here watching the vids is cool enough.
retrogametech Oh, interesting stuff man, thanks a lot
retrogametech Wow Love Iron Bru, I Havent had that since i was a Kid. Time to go to the shop to pick some upm:) Awesome Present
retrogametech for sure bro, wasnt expecting that at all haha. Merry Christmas to you too!!
retrogametech bro, you have no idea. The amount of sugar in that one bar was about a weeks intake. Supper buzzing now lol.
retrogametech Those are some cool gifts! I want to send some nice stuff from my place too, Luke. I didnt forget about the X68000 I promised you )
retrogametech Piss take, who at Nintendo thought this was a good idea?
retrogametech Hows it supposed to work? I go to bed at 10pm so I am fresh for work which I get up at 6am for, so unless I download at the weekend they wont be making any money from me, its a seriously dumb move.
retrogametech Damn! What about adults who go bed early!?!?
retrogametech i have heard its because of german laws, nintendo of europe said they are looking into the laws more
retrogametech due to nintendo based in Germany!!its crazy! great channel,i subbed after seeing lukemorses vid on your christmas present!i love irnbru!
retrogametech I think this is stupid, but I hope they remove the restrictions in other EU countries besides Germany.
retrogametech This move is just cementing Nintendos reputation that its consoles are baby toys.
retrogametech Nintendo has always been heavy on censorship, their arcade ports in the 90s were almost always the censorship versions, and more so thanks to the current fad about complainingprotesting about gender identity.
retrogametech I think its ridiculous because whats stopping kids staying up till 11 and watching it any way... its just an annoyance for the rest of us.
retrogametech Ohhhhh this annoys me so much. Absolutely ridiculous. I swear Nintendo are in their own little bubble. Where is the logic in this decision? Theyre shooting themselves in the foot here.
retrogametech Boycott downloadable content. Refuse to buy it until Nintendo grows the hell up. Its obvious they havent learned from their Mortal Kombat debacle in the 90s. Nothing turns things around like a good hit to the wallet !
retrogametech This is another reason to stick to retro gaming
retrogametech Nintendo... Please remove thy collective heads from thy collective asses. People who grew up in the 80s with the NES, HAVE KIDS NOW!!!! We are old enough to take care of ourselves and this parental restrictive bullshit just insults us for being die hard Nintendo fans.
retrogametech And that my friend is why Nintendo sucks
retrogametech and the children who stay up late? lol
retrogametech please ignore the stupid internet people P
retrogametech When I read the article about this, I felt bad Europe gamers, I think the problem is because Nintendo doesnt really have accounts that you log into the console with, instead you log into your account with the console, if they fix this problem you can have your Mii on your 3DS, then jump on your Wii U or Wii, and only adult players will be allowed to buy things or watch restricted content. But sadly, I fear that wont happen with this generation of consoles... :(
retrogametech Did you film this facing the wall just to get the Christmas tree in the background? Thats the holiday spirit!
retrogametech Larry commenting on a RetroGameTech video? BEST AMALGAMATION EVAR :D
retrogametech I prefer classification over censorship, and these kinds of decisions are why Nintendo will be so far behind the online aspect of console gaming and why I cant justify buying the WiiU.
retrogametech Yeah, I think this is a huge misstep by Nintendo. Its just going to further frustrate some of their audience, and thats really not what they need. Any sort of mandated censorship is bs in my opinion anyway, like that law they tried to pass in the UK about you having to call your internet service provider to enable porn to be viewed.
retrogametech Im of the opinion that parents should actually do some parenting and be responsible for controlling what there children watch, download or listen to. Not that I would use the store on the 3DS, it seems very over priced compared to owning a physical copy of games they have for sale.
retrogametech I think if the parental options are off then people can view all the mature things they want!
retrogametech Good news Nintendo just lifted the access restrictions to mature content on both the 3DS and Wii U.
retrogametech The code on the blue game boy advanced is a code from germany.
retrogametech Lol yeah. I see a lot on ebay, but Im thinking most might be fake or the older backlit model. Thanks.
retrogametech Did not know about the whole ags thing, look at the back of my sp, ags 001  But, it is the tribal sp, which i see is one of the limited edition ones, which i didnt know previously, despite having it for nigh 9 years
retrogametech i was just watching all your videos ive just watched like 20 thanks Keep it up!!
retrogametech Enjoying Mass Effect series eh? I just finished a 13 run of the games today, female Shepard this time. I had traded in my 360 against the Halo 4 360 pack, I got 20 GAME credit back for buying the console. So got 2X 1200points and along with some spare points bought the ME2 Overlord DLC, and the ME3 DLCs Leviathan  Omega. I have all the main DLCs apart from ME1Pinnacle Station, read it was bit meh Great series, its worth doing all the side quests and reading all the codex entries etc.
retrogametech I have a AGS 101. They are very comon in Denmark actualy. Got mine for around 10 pund with 3 games. One of them was supar mario 3 advance thingy
retrogametech I dont mind it, it looks good. Functionality wise it doesnt affect me much either. Ive always viewed new sub uploads from the my username tab in the top right corner. That seems to still be exactly as it was before. But I wish Google would stop switching things up so often! It always causes unnecessary drama.
retrogametech Im getting the subscription glitch were none of your videos are showing up... thanks youtube
retrogametech I remember it from my younger years, I first encountered it eight years ago when I had just turned six, I still have it and play it regularly.
retrogametech RetroGameTech What are you going to be doing for Christmas and the New Year?
retrogametech Im trying to mod a cloned MD2. Any idea if it will work?The motherboard is an exact replica of the original. Im not even 100 sure if it is a clone.
retrogametech I think in Japan they used the EXT port for a modem, but the cable for Zero Tolerance is rare because i think it was a send away thing, so youd need to make a ghetto cable not sure if a regular serial cable would work it might.
retrogametech Love the idea of removing the RF out and adding the extra 3.5mm jack, much better than having a wire sticking out at the front.
retrogametech Hi can u tell me what audio jack u used and possibly a tutorial on the audio jack thanks love your megadrive
retrogametech Cool vid man! These vids seem cool )
retrogametech Yes you will need to switch off the overclock for the Mega CD and 32x as they wont work properley with it as I think they have some kind of sync with the 7mhz clock speed and the 10mhz would mess it up. I think Virtua Racing (MegaDrive NOT 32x) wouldnt work properley either.
retrogametech Whats the point in overclocking it? As far as I know it makes the games all sped up and weird.
retrogametech Great idea swapping the RF port for a headphone jack. Rocker switches look great and are really satisfying to press  if that makes sense.
retrogametech I still use the RF out, as i got a cheap megadrive RF to Scart cable. No modding required, 3.45 on Ebay XD not great, but good enough.
retrogametech Awesome video as ever Martin. I dig the High Definition Graphics Model 1 :) I was looking for one of those when I picked up my Model 1 earlier this year but couldnt find one. They are getting harder to pick up.
retrogametech Do you do mods for other people?
retrogametech I have always used the slide type for this type of mod, wonder how well the rocker ones would fit in a model 2 sega genesis. Totally agree, there is no reason to use RF these days. Only console I cant bring myself to mod is my atari : Its a member of the family and modding a member of your family just seems... wrong. LOOKS GREAT BTW! :)
retrogametech To cut the holes I first drill out the center and then use mini files to file out the shape I want. Didnt know that about the serial port. I love to test that out some time!
retrogametech Thats pretty much been proven to be the worst Genesis ever made. The model 1 usually has the best sound quality (Like, by a pretty huge difference, you can hear a comparison on Wikipedia). However some of the later Model 1s have the same motherboard as the Model 2s, so you gotta be careful about how the ports are arranged at the back. The Model 2s have the best video quality, with brighter colors and such. But audio and build quality arent as good as Model 1s.
retrogametech How come you dont just use the LR audio outputs from the MegaCD? figured those cables were just for people running 32X without the CD
retrogametech I got mine on ebay for about 2.50 I think.
retrogametech or i could buy 1 send to you and pay for conversion and postage how that be:)
retrogametech However, there is a mod you can do to Later Model 1s and Model 2s that makes the audio quality even better than an original Model 1. So then you get the best of both worlds. I forgot exactly what it was called though...I think there was a diagram on how to do it on a forum somewhere. I think if you search Crystal Clear Genesis Mod, it should come up.
retrogametech Martin, in theory shouldnt the MD stereo out run into the mix port of the Mega CD, then the stereo out of the Mega CD into the 32X?
retrogametech As a fellow Scot I have to say his accent is pretty mild and to me he speaks clearly, get your ears tested :)
retrogametech If Martyn aka retro game tech doesnt have the time, ill gladly do one as long as I can find my camera :)
retrogametech Martin, by MDF do you mean Medium Density Fibrewood because if you do, that is the best plan to give yourself cancer ever, MDF is carcenogenic.
retrogametech Took me a second but lol.
retrogametech Amazing project, I really cant wait to see the update...
retrogametech Is HDMI not a popular video output over there? RGB SCART cablesconnectors just seem really bulky.
retrogametech Thanks dude. Im going to try and keep on top of this project and make regular updates :)
retrogametech As someone who has painted MDF, Id say dont bother. The edges of the MDF will soak up the paint and it will look terrible. Id get a roll of stickybacked vinyl and cover it with that instead. Its resilient and looks professional (and would match your plastic bezel).
retrogametech I keep forgetting the part about older systems not being HD, which is where the confusion came from, lol.
retrogametech damn your videos are full of information keep up the good work.
retrogametech Very nice.... I need to get the finger out also.. Ive found a friend who is willing to make me a wooden encasing.. just need to get all the pieces altogether :) I also agree with the supergun approach.. no need to solder right onto the jamma connector like some others do.. where did you get all the different sockets and that? (scarts, jacks, controller port) ebay?
retrogametech Cant wait to see how it turns out :D
retrogametech Nice project! I am going to follow this. BTW, that BIOS, or atleast that matchbox came from Finland. :D
retrogametech I really like the size of that version MVS board man. Very interested to see how the controller ports and final product looks. Cool stuff man :)
retrogametech This will look brilliant youre using some quality parts there. RetroSwede has fitted a circular rocker onoff switch on his Supergun and I think it looks great. Im currently consolising an older piece of kit an Amstrad PCW computer from 1985, Im gonna call it a CPCW now :)
retrogametech why remove the metal from the controller ports? everything else sounds solid.
retrogametech Awesome brand new video
retrogametech Thanks for the tips Ed. I think cutting the MDF clean and accurate is going to be my biggest challenge. Ideally I should use a table saw but unfortunately I dont have access to something like that. Im going to have to do a lot of sanding I think! Im surprised you havent gone down the CMVS route yet! :P At least you have your fancy AES to play Neo Geo on!
retrogametech glad to see youre still working on it, thought you had abandoned it! should be pretty cool
retrogametech Thats a pretty coll idea :)
retrogametech Maybe instead of removing the metal of the controller ports just cut off the boltscrew parts leaving the metal surrounds then mount on the mdf or the plastic panel which ever way you choose, that way the metal will be flush with the wood or plastic and will be much stronger. :)
retrogametech I want to do this, hopefully I can once I get my CNC and make it soo pretty. Awesome work man!
retrogametech RGB scart has been around for 30 years. HDMI has not... When your dealing with hardware from the 80s its not going to have HDMI
retrogametech Great video. Just started one of these myself, would be great to see an update when you get time )
retrogametech monitoring the process...
retrogametech MDF is a low risk material IMO. The dust poses a health risk but this is true of most wood based building materials. Its the formaldehyde resins used in MDF that people have concerns about. However, wearing a dust mask and working in a ventilated area should be more than enough to keep you safe. Ive worked with MDF for years, Im not concerned. I bet a lot of the furniture and units in your homeschoolcollegework are made out of MDF :P
retrogametech Thanks! Itll be tricky to getting the finish I want but hopefully itll all look good in the end :)
retrogametech Good luck with it Martian!!
retrogametech Great vid as always, and what a great project. Cant wait to see this finished.
retrogametech Bit late for this project, but you can get minidin connectors that match the Megadrive model 2 sockets. Then you can use premade megadrive scart cables on future projects that dont have room for the full scart socket in the casing.
retrogametech Thanks for such a good video showing how easy it would be to repairreplace.
retrogametech I have the blue Japanese dreamcast I am never going to take that apart
retrogametech Taking apart the dreamcast?
retrogametech Its a plastic piece of plastic!!!!!! yayyy!!!!!
retrogametech The title of this is misleading, you never took your clothes off.
retrogametech Thanks. I appreciate the feedback. I might do a few more of these videos as I work on different console in future :)
retrogametech sweat band for added suspense
retrogametech awesome you took stripped that down like a boss , your videos are really top notch :)
retrogametech Very good video and well done so that people can pause it at stages to make the tear down easy.
retrogametech If theres any music that gets me pumped for tearing down electronics (or for anything, really), its After Burner music. Probably some of the greatest compositions of all time.
retrogametech Thanks for watching and commenting :)
retrogametech i can tell that is a version 0 too because of the heat pipes. i have a 0 and a 1. i dont know how you use ice trey like that. seems harder to know where each ones goes like that.
retrogametech I believe you can make and use substances like Retr0bright to restore old systems. But Its not something Ive ever tried myself.
retrogametech I bet I could probably do it in 3 and a half to 4 :P . Ive fixed so many of these things over the years I honestly could do this blindfolded, haha.
retrogametech yes orange for japanese and more red for north america
retrogametech i did this before. it really isnt hard but a lot of screws.
retrogametech Thanks dude. Yeah those screwdrivers come in really handy sometimes. Makes the job that bit easier! :)
retrogametech smash shift for a few seconds to turn off sticky keys that shit is fucking annoying to read on youtube
retrogametech Once again, another fascinating video...thanks brother!
retrogametech LIKE A BOSS!!!! :D:D:D
retrogametech Martin, youre spot on in regards to the Space Harrier BGM. I think thats probably the western release of the early Sega Ages 2500 games that were developed by the second party 3DAges  which explains why they veer from the original games to such a degree.
retrogametech Some interesting pickups there, cool that the Mega Drive wireless controllers are backwards compatible with the Master System. By the way, have you noticed any buffering issues on Youtube over the past few weeks. At certain times of the day quality settings as low as 240p take an age to load. No problems on the iPlayer at same time so must be Youtube specific. If youve had problems google this Oyl8HEc4rHg, should bring you to a Slow buffering google productforum page. Maybe EU server issue?
retrogametech I actually kinda like it! lol :P . Thanks btw :)
retrogametech You should monetize your channel!
retrogametech Ever Think Of Trying To Integrate The Wireless Receiver Like You Did With Your Xbox? In My Opinion It Would Certainly Look Nicer.
retrogametech I got a reply :D Thank you :)
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech That poor Mega Drive, as if getting all the other ports filled wasnt degrading enough. I love Shadow Dancer! I hate that it was not released in US. I dont think I have ever seen a F1 car drift like that...but I would pay money to see someone do it. That Space Harrier music is...intersting?
retrogametech Im from portugal, im not really into N gage games, but ill see what i can do. If I do find the game, i can send it to you if you pay postage.
retrogametech the golden axe remix looks quality haha might look out for that ive just starting picking up ps2 games, and also original xbox games(again) your setup is quality, i had a set of wireless controllers for the master system although they died long ago, not sure if they worked on the megadrive also but they had C buttons and were megadrive shaped think i have the reciever around somewhere. and oooh jesus that space harrier music is pure cheddar cheese
retrogametech Why dont you monetize your videos...you fool. On a serious note...you should offer your services or some kind of merchandise so we can help support your habits. :D
retrogametech You seem Like a nice person, I think you present in a very well thought out and well spoken manner. You seem like the kind of person i would become fast friends with. Well who knows right? I have no idea if your open to making friends through youtube? If you do feel like making a friend I would be happy to chat and talk games.
retrogametech 16:05 this music reminds me of a Wii Shop Channel game I played. With a 3dTetris type of thing. I think it was called thruspace.
retrogametech I really like the Golden Axe remake! Its so cheesy! XD
retrogametech Golden Axe on PS2 Sega Classic Collection ..... awful and a desecration to the coin op original imo
retrogametech Congrats on 10K subs and 3 million views! Your commitment to providing quality content is impeccable I dont think many people would burn themselves while making a video, and still worry about having the right angle. :)
retrogametech congrats too on 10k subs and the last n gage game!!
retrogametech Awesome! Good to see those wireless controllers in a collectors hands who could bring them back to life. Nice job with the DVD cover plastic though :P
retrogametech thanks for the shout out dude! was fun to make a response! no ginger cat pick up? lol cool u picked up sega classic collection! i picked that up a few years aga ar car boot! only played out run your vid will make me play it again! great work dude:)
retrogametech congrats on the 10k subs! keep it up your videos are the best!!
retrogametech I thought it was probably a combination of my ISP (O2) and YouTube messing with their buffering settings. I noticed recently that some videos wont continue bufferingloading in the background if you pause them. It might continue downloading an extra 30sec of video but then stops until you hit play again. I was thinking it was maybe an attempt to curb wasted bandwidth? i.e. people watching half a vid then clicking on something else?
retrogametech I actually own the 6 button wireless controllers with the receiver. They still work great. I like them better then the original 3 button controller. The d pad is much better and not stiff.
retrogametech I got a good deal on my sega genesis wireless controllers, too. I got one controller and the reciever in a lot of 20 Broken genesis controllers for about 20 shipped. I tried them and all of the controllers worked except two third party controllers.
retrogametech Been Watching Since August 2010. Looking Forward To Another 2 Years, Cheers!
retrogametech XD that do sound up like a mashup of steps and venga boys
retrogametech Great Sunday video ..Enjoyed this. Have an awesome day.
retrogametech RGB SCART looks pretty good still even on a HD LCD TV, but dont know what the poster uses himself
retrogametech Thank you very much. Youre really good at it, amd your tutorial is very helpful. It will help me a lot to fix my 3DS.
retrogametech not bad at all. If you use the braid the beginning you can get to solder off a little easier. If you have a heat gun that allows control of air flow the port will be easier to remove, provided that it can apply as much heat as the iron without all the air. You can presolder the contacts on the board with the flux and the iron. Then use the heat gun to melt the solder when the slot is lined up and its leads will drop into place the second the solder melts. The key is is lots of heat without too much blowing if you can find the right hot air tool. Invest in a hot air heat handle and watch the magic happen.
retrogametech Do more of these please.
retrogametech So the cover to the motherboard is just crosshead screws and not Nintendobits? So If i only had two small connectors inside the cartridge bay bent, then I should be able to band them back into place right? Can I reinforce them with solder or electrical tape?
retrogametech Lol, something like that :P
retrogametech Thanks. Just search for faulty and whatever it is your looking for. Thats how I do it. :)
retrogametech Awesome... (Also, I need to work on my soldering skills so that I can do this replacement easily.) Theres this guy in my local chinatown that repairs and resolders old and new consoles. He always has a few 3DSes. :D
retrogametech i just enjoyed watching a video about soldering. some things can only happen in Glasgow... another great video mate, cheers, ashton lane rulezzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
retrogametech Thank you, Ill try to make more of these.
retrogametech Great video, nicely detailed :)
retrogametech Nice stuff! Interesting to see the 3DS being fixed in real time :)
retrogametech Your post made me laugh really hard, you have a good point
retrogametech Really interesting video :)
retrogametech epic :D btw your subbed and liked
retrogametech Great setup mate :D are you from the UK
retrogametech Great video bristolian? ?
retrogametech Good to see so many modded consoles! That pirate Famicom game looks pretty interesting, Ill need to check out your other vid. Btw, Im seriously jealous you have that DoA stick! haha Theyre really expensive! Thanks for taking the time to post a response!
retrogametech Thanks Martian! Very rare game actually, luckily some collector wanted to part with it. Hope you enjoy my other video too :). Haha, yep was super expensive  I had to get it though Im a huge DoA fan. No worries man, love your videos!
retrogametech That room looks like one hell of a playground (a good thing), Luke. I love these gaming set up vids and hope you dont mind but I made a real quick vid response of my own set up. Its nothing grand but something I wanted to do for some time.
retrogametech love your behind scenes videos.
retrogametech Loving the new set up as always! Awesome to see what consoles you have running in the console corner of the room.
retrogametech Very cool video as always.
retrogametech I would love to have all of my 20 systems hooked up at once like you guys but unless I can come up with a good way of making it clutter free looking I dont think its going to happen.... My wife would most certainly throw a shit fit.
retrogametech Man you and Retro Game tech, always making me jealous... and for real how the hell can I get an xbox mod chip??? I cant for the life of me find anybody who sells them. where do I look?
retrogametech Lets be honest here: Your Neo Geo MVS Cabs own all these Consols. Everyone can have those but not the Cabs which are truly amazing.
retrogametech Wow awesome! Now to play some lunar magic school.
retrogametech The 360s delta fan whine is haunting me :D I cant stand those deltas! I love how nidecs sound and the slim model fans. Really queit.
retrogametech god damn Im so jealous! nice systems man! 1010
retrogametech I was hoping to have it done a while ago but between moving and essays galore I have no time. Ill eventually get to it when ive setup my computer.
retrogametech Nice setup. Right now Ive got a 2 ps1s, ps2, gamecube, 2 xboxes, 2 xbox 360s and a ps3. Did have an nes, snes, megadrive a few years ago, but some twat broke into my flat and nicked them when I was away one weekend. Got plans to get them all again though.
retrogametech Dude, quick question, i have a dreamcast keyboard in MINT condition, boxed, with the plastic bag it was inside in the box if you are interested?
retrogametech Argos a couple of years ago. Think it was about 25.
retrogametech Thanks dude! Yeah I cant keep anything stock. Ive always got to take things apart, find out how they work, and, most importantly, install blue LEDs :) Btw, you going to be doing your QA responses after youre done moving?
retrogametech Good to see a fellow piratecollector... Just because you have backups doesnt mean you dont buy legit stuff too. Im seriously running out of space.
retrogametech I used to repair 360s all the time back when they were going through their unreliable phase. Ive never kept a 360 longer than a year or 2 before selling it to buy a newer revision. The later hardware revisions are much better but Id quite like a 4GB slim for the quieter running. Thanks for watching and I appreciate you taking the time comment :).
retrogametech Subbed recently, by far my favourite channel, so envious of this setup,
retrogametech Awesome xD You listen to the best swiss Band 0 And I really love your gaming setup Q
retrogametech Got my CMVS project on the way P
retrogametech Thanks dude! Yeah Shadow Dancer is great! Found that cart on ebay super cheap! :)
retrogametech Thanks dude! No updated tour with your new consoles?
retrogametech I love your channel especially your ebay junk videos
retrogametech I know you dont spend much on these consoles but a lot of work has been put in. Im useless with an iron tbh. The 60hz mods are out of my league. If I wanted a set up like this, Id have to throw enough cash down just to buy it outright from someone who was clever enough to do all the work for me haha I know what you mean about the early 3D games looking poor compared to clean sprites. Although I liked the PS1N64 era, I definitely felt that way about the early 3D games on the Mega Drive  SNES
retrogametech loving the sega collection!
retrogametech Your hardware is so awesome!!
retrogametech Looks awesome man. I love my CDX.
retrogametech look at that wad of black plastic, lovely :)
retrogametech I am always blown away by your setup. It looks like you put so much time and effort into it. I would be really proud if I ever pulled off anything half as tidy as that ) Keep it up :D
retrogametech Thanks Ed. I considered wrapping the broomstick in black electrical tape but Im too lazy even for that :P.
retrogametech Awesome setup! Reaally loved how everything got together in there! And the light show at the end was really cool aswhell!
retrogametech R4is are Fake in the sense that it wasnt made by the original R4 team. So ALL the R4is you see are fake. Though the really early R4s you have in your pile might be real, but you would have to really look at them hard and perhaps have a real one on hand to spot them as fake or not.
retrogametech I remember in 20082009 this was the done thing if you had a DS
retrogametech You could always hide the faulty ones in the dashboard of an abandoned derilict Ford Escort.
retrogametech No way of knowing but mine have a bug where they wont boot unless I set the DS clock to a few years in the past! No faults with my cyclo DS though
retrogametech wasnt the original DS flashcart the M3 adapter? i had one near launch it was for GBADS and took big CF cards later on the R4 and M3 used the same components if remember and its just a different shell
retrogametech but if thats the case they really wouldnt work or work right... the official website to download the firmware is constantly being updated as well and the fact we can download the firmware and it works on the cards kinda means that cant be true ive never heard of such a thing anyway about the bumps even the r4 devs show or did show how to spot fake cards another way is the sticker on back or some writing which is actually the main way i think but again ive never heard about the whole bump thing
retrogametech Im looking to buy an r4 card. Can you help me? I dont know which website to use becuase everyone I ask says a different thing...I live in USA so I would like one that does free shipping in USA. Bc a few other sites do free ship but they are in china and other foreign places. If you can respond, that would be great :) Thank you.!
retrogametech Nintendo have allegedly made r4 unuseable on 3ds.
retrogametech very nice man, im sure youll get a bit more going for sure. nice pick ups
retrogametech That is ALLOT of R4 cards
retrogametech They arent illegal to have. Youre no longer allowed to sell them but thats about it. And that really only applies to bigger resellers who might want to import a large quantity for openly selling to the general public. Selling or bundling these off secondhand wont be any issue.
retrogametech These are supposed to be illegal to sell on ebay...
retrogametech How much would you sell one of these for?
retrogametech I Got one for 30 bucks in turkey, sold as a Nintendo Super 300 PACK. works dandy.
retrogametech Can someone link or tell me wich FLASHCARDs there are the best for softmoding DS,DSL,DSI,DSi or XL
retrogametech Go to the official site Ed, there are a few. Some games seem to work with different ones. Very annoying.
retrogametech thats not possible i even ordered a couple from different places one is official they all had the same bump only acekard etc dont ive never seen an (well at least more current r4s even the 3ds) they all have bumps only the really old cards dont
retrogametech In that case would you mind selling me a blank one as you wouldnt be selling any games, just the ability to use them?
retrogametech A lot of people here have suggested the Wood firmware as a generic one that works on most. Maybe thatll work?
retrogametech please tell me cause i really want one of thecause i cntt find any of them on ebay
retrogametech where can i find a case like that for DS games? P.S I live in Greece and its very hard to find.
retrogametech I originally bought an M3. It works crazy well.
retrogametech Wood R4 is the best software for r4. The Acekard2i is great.
retrogametech The TT cards work nice, used to have one years ago for my DS.
retrogametech RetroGameTech I hope youve had a chance to look at the PM I sent you Id love to watch you do this modification if you could do a full on tut of it thatd be awesome. I think you could do it easily.
retrogametech Forget it now, its really an horrible pirate game.
retrogametech where did you get this?
retrogametech That looks pretty cool for what it is. I cant believe that someone took the time to do that, and even more amazingly how they foreshadow Sonic moving house to Nintendo )
retrogametech (Please respond!) Where can I get this actual cartridge?
retrogametech you can use supergameboy, so recording will be easier.
retrogametech That music is horrific, it shouldnt even be legal to put that music on that bootleg game lol...
retrogametech Its actually not too bad. The controls are a little unresponsive but otherwise its a pretty decent bootleg. A lot better than that Sonic Fighter GBA game I got a few weeks back.
retrogametech OMG, the music is simply unacceptable xD.
retrogametech Its the intro music to Sonic  Knuckles from MegaDrive.... HORRIBLY BUTCHERED!
retrogametech dude run y r u walking your supposed 2 make sonic run
retrogametech YOU. HAVE. BEEN. WARNED.
retrogametech Its the MD everywhere except North America. They had to change the name in North America because of trademarklegal issues.
retrogametech Have you never heard any chiptune or what can be produced using a GameBoy and LSDJ? You should YouTube it! )
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech I have the exact same cartridge. :) watch?vubX0a8Ngct3m40s
retrogametech Its the MD everywhere except North America. They had to change the name in North America because of trademarklegal issues.
retrogametech where do you get all your broken consoles from ? not apt for this video but i keep forgetting to ask lol
retrogametech The music sounds like a cryptic message from deep space.
retrogametech thank god you told me that, it was genuinely doing my head in!
retrogametech I Believe In A Thing Called Love by The Darkness? Horrible
retrogametech Sure, just look at Final Fantasy! I made the joke a long time ago, I think they are going to keep it limping on long enough to get into the 70s with it...
retrogametech this game is horrible
retrogametech Suddenly the ugliest man in Glasgow wasnt good enough for her!
retrogametech Sonic 3D Blast 5 lmao..
retrogametech Just want to say Im loving your videos and I also love the Double Dragon Neon soundtrack!
retrogametech Hey man can u help me I have a ds lite that doesnt work, the probelms is that when I turn it on the power light is on (green) but theres no sound or picture.
retrogametech Ive read about it and seen the result. Never tried it myself.
retrogametech The lime green DSl is nice man, I saw one recently and wanted to get it, just for the colour :P
retrogametech Just messing around with and modding old consoles over the years. You pick up and learn as you go. None of what I do is overly complicated or difficult :) . Most of the time things just need a full strip down and clean.
retrogametech Cheers, Rob! From memory Deadlight is supposed to be 5 hours long (I think). Pretty sure I finished it in about 23 sittings. Its not massively long but some parts can be really tricky and require multiple attempts. I loved it and Im going back to 100 it and find all the collectables etc. Perfect game for Halloween! :P
retrogametech Cheers, dude! Got most of it up and running, just waiting on a few parts. Will def need to get a game of Mario Kart when I find myself a copy! :)
retrogametech Lol, Its weird, definitely not a colour Id usually go for. But when you see them in real life they look awesome! The real colour doesnt really come across on camera.
retrogametech i will download it ! but last nite i broke my hand left hand! so is impoosable to play games! its hell for me not to be able to play games!!! :)
retrogametech Le Joker Dans Toute Sa Splendeur
retrogametech Whats the website that you use to order spare parts and offbrand replacement cases. I know youve mentioned it in previous videos but I cant seem to remember the website. Its based in China and starts with a D I believe. I would really appreciate a response. Excellent work on the videos and console repairs man. Keep it up.
retrogametech Interesting videos, I remember when I found out how to fix dropped G.B.As, it took 5 seconds to fix and without any soldering, I sold one on and made about 40 profit, I would have fixed a lot more if Nintendo hadnt released the S.P. so soon. Then I bought a faulty S.P  fitted the glass  lighting to my translucent G.B.A, with some extra l.e.ds on the sides  a switch, that was my first D.I.Y project.
retrogametech Ah ok cheers, I thought it might had to involve taking everything apart for some reason lol. Looking forward to the update :D.
retrogametech Yes they do, he lives just one city over and although they are rare, we do have them.
retrogametech No, but I think there are a few videos showing that on YouTube already. As long as you are reasonably confident with a soldering iron then its not too difficult.
retrogametech Is the GBA SP NES version still availible?
retrogametech Ill try and do a vid on that when I get some spare time. Ive not used it much yet so cant really give a good opinion on it.
retrogametech I could never let my stuff get dirty like that, my GBA SP is a little scratched but that was more the previous owner and my little brother and sister than me.
retrogametech Hi,Do you have any more information on how this was made? I want to make something similar is there a schematic you followed at all?
retrogametech 10 pounds is 16.68 dollars. Sorry. But you were close enough. So yeah
retrogametech nice class idea man great vids :)
retrogametech If I ever get my Genesis  CD  32X working, Ill give this mod a try.
retrogametech Thanks dude. Did you notice the game I had plugged in? lol Had to dig that out after watching your recent gameplay.
retrogametech Thanks.. I figured it out. I also burned 3 32x units however I managed to get them fixed by replacing one of the components on it.
retrogametech Wow your power plugs are different than my north American plugs
retrogametech Those are the strangest plugs I have EVER seen. Im used to polarized plugs and occasionally a round grounding pin.
retrogametech Sounds like you need a couple of those Sega strips! lol
retrogametech As a mega drive gameplay vetran myself, OMG, at 2:21 you used one of those 12 volt outlets. IM PROUD OF YOU!!!!!!! Ya know, Id rather rig up a sealed leadacid battery in a cubby on the TV stand, and allow a lowamp power brick to recharge it before using more realtime watt output for the Sega systems, seeing that we only play video games for 8 hours a day at average. I can do some eyeballed math since I am an advocate for use of SLA batteries. I have other reasons in mind to use a batt
retrogametech Do you have a brand and model number for one of those power supplies please?
retrogametech The voltages and current running though the wires is very low. Theyre all soldered together and properly insulated so the chance of fire is extremely low. The cigarette adapter has been completely gutted. Its really just a plastic housing to keep the wires from getting tangled or damaged and isnt part of the circuit. The PSU itself is fused as is the power strip itll be connected to. So any major short circuit or component failure would burn out the fuse before anything else.
retrogametech Haha, thanks dude. Those oversized power adapters have always bugged me and Ive been after a way to get rid of them for a while! Im sure people have done this before although I dont think anyone has ever released a commercial product. Is that the cable that gives you stereo sound over RGB scart with both mk1s? Ive got me one of those too! Awesome!
retrogametech Whats that xbox lcd th ing
retrogametech Very copla mem thanks
retrogametech SOOOOO MANY WIRES! lol
retrogametech Thanks. The thing in the Master System card slot is the 3D adapter for the 3D glasses. Its basically a 3.5mm socket where you connect up your 3D LCD shutter glasses. I did a demo on it a few vids back if youre interested to see the Master System 3D in action :) .
retrogametech Interesting, can I ask how long you played and did you compare the picture quality before and after? Ive tried similar experiments and concluded that, with the MegaCD especially, the lack of a dedicated ground completely killed picture quality.
retrogametech Woah, thats kind of creepy, it looks just like what I did... Complete with the psone plug... OO
retrogametech Great idea mate nice one
retrogametech Werent some of those meant to take 10v instead?
retrogametech Is that a ps1 power cable in the middle?
retrogametech I was going to say the same.
retrogametech Just noticed that you have a Genesis CDX, would like to know if this console have any problems like loading problems, and the overall lifespam of the console is the same than using a mega drive and a sega cd?
retrogametech i would love to see a tutorial for this!
retrogametech Most of the official PSUs state 10V as their output. I think the Master System is the only one that states 9V. Testing with a multimeter showed most official Sega PSUs output over that at around 14V. But all the consoles have regulators and circuitry inside them to lowermanage voltage to the levels they require (probably only about 5V7V in most cases). You can happily run a Mega Drive using a 7.5V supply as long as the PSU has a high enough Amp rating.
retrogametech Do you know how to fix the sync issue on mega drive when you using RGB ?
retrogametech Very nice although definitely reserved for people that know what they are doing. Would be nothing worse than plugging it in and just seeing a puff of smoke from them all
retrogametech My experteise of installing 12 volt components on nonmotorized vehicles such as headlights and car radios is what helped me understand how functional 12 volt systems can be even outside of vehicles. You should also check out my videos of how my bicycles use their 12 volt systems. I even went as far as putting cigarette lighter receptacles on my bikes since my frequent riding may want to involve recharging of cell phones, or use of electric car tire pumps in case air pressure goes low.
retrogametech You can buy these on retrogamecave They call it the Sega Trio
retrogametech Man ,you genius! i have in mind the same kind of idea!
retrogametech The reason im asking is because i just bought one for 60 dollars, and it works perfectly, only downside is that it didnt come in the original box. I got it for my collection and considering how difficult it is to find one in working order especially in my country, i kind of scared that it will break if i keep using, because a play a lot.
retrogametech Quick question, how did you wire up your RGB cable directly from the JAMMA harness? I got myself an MVS board and a Framemeister, but Im not entirely sure as to how the wiring should be done.
retrogametech I want one in a cabinet!!!
retrogametech I love that both of those games share lots of sound effects from Metal Slug :D
retrogametech Im interested in seeing what the new screensaver addition looks like for the jukebox player on the bios update. Would be cool to see when you have the time.
retrogametech hey dude, hope you get better soon! Also, ive been wondering for a while, where did you get your watch? Its awesome! :D
retrogametech Thanks dude! Its nice to finally get to mess around with some of those games1 XD
retrogametech Great stuff! Always look forward to updates! Keep up the hard work!
retrogametech I really like the compact size of this board, it should make a nice looking console when youre done. I also really like the NeoGeo CD controllers. The picture looked great to me. Hope you feel better soon.
retrogametech Will be good to have a working unit, so you can maybe get more games etc Hope you feel better soon, plenty of rest  games :)
retrogametech i cant wait to see the finished product!
retrogametech Its a slippery slope son, and you are already skidding :)
retrogametech Thanks! Yep, the whole thing is stock. The battery is in good condition and working fine so no reason to replace it just yet.
retrogametech btw love your vids. wish i could do this
retrogametech I was surprised how quickly the UniBIOS arrived! Im looking forward to messing about with it. Its actually kinda cool to see how they improved the board design and replaced a lot of the big IC chips with much smaller surface mount components. Its a really tidy and compact design! Im not sure on the materials yet. Probably just a combination of different thickness MDF. Its easy to work with, durable and paints well. I want it to look sleek, minimalistic and simple. Any suggestions?
retrogametech Dazza2292 us retro fans havent gone BACK to these graphics, we never left them!
retrogametech Yeah the power supply I use is pretty small. ill pm you the website and product number so you can check it out.
retrogametech Another interesting mod that a few people have done to the MV1B, is to remove the cartridge slot PCB, and reconnect it so that it is back to back with the mainboard. This makes for a very tiny NeoGeo MVS that can be put in a small housing with a vertical cart slot.
retrogametech This is going to be really cool. I look forward to seeing the final product. Good luck man!
retrogametech I actually own a copy of this! I bought it at Ayr market for 2.
retrogametech He Did A Video On It A Short Time Back, I Actually Just Remembered It Existed And Added It To My Wish List.
retrogametech Where did you get this? i want one
retrogametech Its just blank info, sadly. 00s repeated to 32mb. :S
retrogametech Hey I sent you a PM the other day, did you get it? I needed you advice on something I bought.
retrogametech I love how bootlegs always add little mechanics. THROWING his spindash is kinda cool.
retrogametech Wow! Looks like a real winner to me....
retrogametech I always look forward to watching the latest RGT vid.
retrogametech retrogametch u r lieing
retrogametech Lol, Ive never played a Pokemon game but it really wouldnt surprise me! Theyve borrowed bits from all over the place.
retrogametech I would totally pick that game up
retrogametech I dont think its encrypted or has copy protection or anything like that, I think its just stored in a different way which the dumping software doesnt know how to read, which would explain why it just dumps an empty file. Ive got a fake Pokemon Emerald that does the same thing.
retrogametech That ring colected sound is from pokemon.
retrogametech Sorry, Larry. I find it really difficult to manage both my PM inbox and respond to the comments people leave on my vids. I try to respond to everyone but unfortunately I just dont have the time. Comments left on my vids always take priority since theyre public and any useful info that gets exchanged can be viewed, shared and added to by everyone in the community. My PM inbox doesnt get so much attention but I do go through it every few weeks and respond to what I can when I find time.
retrogametech So did Sonic! xD Looked like he was jamming to the beat with his idle animation in this one.
retrogametech its the same engine for the Crash Bandicoot Bootleg
retrogametech Its crazy! I have two pirated GBA games. Metroid Zero and Jackie Chan. Both dump no problem as do all my original games. Bootleggers bring out their own unique unlicensed games and they manage to secure their code better than Nintendo!! Amazing! XD

retrogametech thats the 6v micro controller, i think the best bet is to leave it as it is, those little feckers are a pain in the balls to take off and replace, all this does is acts as a relay switch which has a on and off controller, just like 12 relays in a car, it senses the voltage and turns on or off according to power, bridging it would probably just shorten the life of the unit by a non substantial amount due to being on all the time, ive had all the tritons but the new pro plus are really good :)
retrogametech got to give it to ya mate you have some skill and patience for some footery stuff... wish i had that lol id grab a set of these n fix them but mines would end up out the winda
retrogametech hey man!....great videos...i wonder...can u help me with.. Xstatic sharkoon 5.1 headphones i brought them for 2 euros on flee market.... missing extra parts....i only got headphones with cut cable... no volume control on cable,no digital device...no propriety jack. i peel off cable isolation and i got 1011 wires didnt mapped jet 4x two colored twisted wires 3x one colored wires red green blue mapped 2x plastic wires green and blue for neon light 1x dabble wire i bet its for mix
retrogametech As I was watching the video I looked over at my Xbox and it had the red dot of death
retrogametech Your best bet is ebay, or if youre in the US you can also find things on Freecycle and Craigslist. Garage and yard sales are also common places to find these things cheap. When on ebay, you can search for broken or for partsrepair in the descriptions to narrow the field. Its a little time consuming, but you can find great deals.
retrogametech anybody know how to fix if your optical case thing comes off ? please reply if so
retrogametech Driver San Francisco haha :)
retrogametech Then dont read it moron.
retrogametech and how exactly did you connect these teo
retrogametech I Was Kinda Annoyed About The Wireless On Mine At First Because My Old Headphones Had Volume Adjusters. But When I Have A 360 Controller Play And Charge Kit, Possibly 360 Headphones, Samsung Galaxy Tab Charger All Around Me, I Dont Miss Having An Extra Cord.
retrogametech I cant believe you gave up on the other board) If it was me, I would sell both faulty boards and find one that works, but that is because I am getting lazy in my old age.
retrogametech if characters are being substituted, then you have a stuck address or data line somewhere.
retrogametech Thanks! :) That explains a lot. So it looks like theres maybe an issue with the RAM or video output?
retrogametech Did you get these boards going mate??
retrogametech That look like a RAM Issue to me. Now Im a bit extreme but Id try to verify that the RAM is working through a Test firstly. Do you have a LogicAnalyser or Scope? If so then try to grab Data from the ICs as they pass on the DataBus. This will require you to get at the Pins though, maybe desolder the 68000, replace it with a Connecter then grab it from there as it passes to and from the 68000. For the Custom ICs this will be harder. Good work thus far :)
retrogametech NEW CONSOLIZED PROJECT CHECK YOUR MESSAGERS search Sega STV Titan Arcade Jamma Mother Board on ebay
retrogametech Wosk Sam Vesu is czech but I cant get google translate to work on it so.......
retrogametech The language looks like some form of Klingon hehe :D Good stuff Martin, looks like youre definitely getting it sorted out :) Seems like its resetting itself over and over...I read something about that a week or 2 ago but cant remember what it was about. Luke will probably know.
retrogametech It looks like a badshorted pin in the bios chip probably one of the data lines. since you see the lines on the screen, try tracing the bios lines (especially data) and check em.
retrogametech The text is in English, but there are characters being substituted. The RAM test screen says WORK RAM TEST, but the R, T, and space characters are being substituted with S, U, and ! respectively. The same substitutions are showing up in the menu, among some others (Y for X in EXIT).
retrogametech I installed a CR2032 on my Pokemon silver cartridge. I considered a battery holder, but again, I wasnt really satisfied that I had to keep using such a small battery. I just guessed that a larger battery would keep my save file for longer. I mean, same voltage, twice the size, thus much bigger capacity. If the original battery kept my save file for about 11 years, the the new one should hit the 1520 years mark quite easily.What I did was to cut the old battery from its metal pins, and simple placed the new, larger battery on those pins. I didnt use solder, as the cartridge case alone (when closed) aplied enough pressure on it to keep it in place. I did use one small strip of electric tape to keep the larger battery contacts away from the cartridge PCB, though. As I said before, its a tight fit, the cartridge kinda get a little bulkier where the new battery is, about 1mm, but that doesnt do any damage to the cartridge case or the gameboy. It still slides easily into any Gameboy related product without ploblems, and its been working fine until now. (and Ive done this mod about 2 years ago) )
retrogametech Its much cheaper and I enjoy the process of DIY. You can get some pcs front light panels for game boys in aliexpress I got some pcs,a 4LED front panel. White LED and I put in front of the game boy LCD. it works perfect. Probably,next time I would get some colorful front lights,like RGB? It should be much cool,isnt it? You can see my DIY Game boys below. Also, youll find more tips about the DIY process here.: aliexpress(dot)comstore406029
retrogametech Very nice tip! Thanks for sharing Im going to try this out for sure.
retrogametech can you do this same mod with the snes cardtridges
retrogametech I doubt youd be able to fit something like this inside a GBA cart. Although, only a few GBA games actually use batteries for saving. From what Ive seen its mostly only bootlegs that use batteries. There were also a handful of early genuine titles that use them but its pretty uncommon.
retrogametech Could this same concept work with NESSNES games as well?
retrogametech A great tip Martin, one of the reasons I subbed : )
retrogametech Might not, because the top plastic is different  it goes down, while the GBC plastic goes up.
retrogametech Very nice :D All button celld batteries have the same 3V voltages, The number indicates the size of the battery. Usually the life of the battery really depends on the environment theyre stored in. :P
retrogametech I actually ordered a lot of a 100 cr2032 battery holders and replaced all my batteries in my NES games and put in the battery holders. Im eventually going to replace all my SNES, SMS and Genesis batteries and install battery holders.
retrogametech hey can you do a video on how to do this? i have a few games that i want to try this mod on.
retrogametech while the gameboy is turned on?
retrogametech They do! Check out this video with a tutorial on how to put them inside Pokmon Gold (same shape as Red): watch?vCKU6hDHgnNQ
retrogametech The lower capacity of the CR1220 wont be an issue with this setup. You could even be super extravagant and replace the battery once a year for 10 years and it would still be about half the cost of buying a single CR2025 with solder tabs. And once the CR1220 battery holder is in place youll never have to solder anything ever again XD.
retrogametech Metallica!! Ride the Lightening!
retrogametech YOU WERE PLAYING METALLICA IN THE BACKGROUND!!! FUCK YEAH
retrogametech 200sex. Tee hee I know its the accent but its kinda funny. (no offence!)
retrogametech i bet the seller on ebay is watching this yelling HOLY SHIT ALL I HAD TO DO WAS PRESS THAT FUCKING BUTTON!
retrogametech DaveSimonH Have you PS3 re pasted with new Thermal paste and your good for another 23 yrs depend on useage.. Happy gaming
retrogametech Cool Mod. I recently got a modded XBOX with installed XECUTER 2.6 Modchip and secondary Hard Drive on Amazon for 40. Fun Fact: It came with a fresh installed build of XBMC 1.1 from April 2005 or so. The seller didnt even know the console was modded, so I think it was a good deal. I love to use my XBOX as a media center. :3
retrogametech I have one of these, its the business, but how do you change the text on the LCD, mine says toms box.
retrogametech Hey Martin, that protect switch is for so you wont accidently flash your X3 chip. Great find dude. Im suprised how it end up on ebay due to ebay rulez with anything with modding. Ebay is very strict
retrogametech or actually just has to be connected to internet maybe idk?
retrogametech I remember getting that same clear System for my brother awhile back. It wasnts modded though. A really cool system! Im glad you were able to get the system as nonworking a great deal!
retrogametech My modded Xbox has the same case cool.
retrogametech Protect switch was to disable the mod chip if you were playing Xbox Live
retrogametech Do you ever feel bad for getting a really low price on a really rare console?
retrogametech Those are cool. Im liking the Mettalica!
retrogametech Haha, thats what I thought. Its been so long since I messed around with anything X3 related. I notice the dip switch panel on my own box has a little protect dip too. Memories coming back now! :P It wasnt explicitly listed as modded and to be fair it was only up for a couple of minutes before I snagged it :P . Suppose it just slipped through the net. Kinda lucky! I see you have a couple of these in black? Do you still use yours much?
retrogametech is that a dreamcast in your pic
retrogametech I still have mine with all this on it too, but mine is blue and has a custom Halo Legendary Elite skull center jewel with LEDs, i never use it, thought about selling it many times but glad i keep it :)
retrogametech Modding XBoxes. Its so fun soldering wire to vias while trying to make sense of crap quality photos that may or may not relate to either your XBox or the modchip you bought. I used XBMC on mine for about 3 years and it was great. Now I run XBMC on a jailbroken Apple TV 2 and its equally great  but can decode H.264 video.
retrogametech I have another Xbox with an Xecuter 3 modchip but a faulty drive... Ill need to remove it and install it to my main Xbox!
retrogametech Someones listening to RIDE THE LIGHTNING! fist bumps
retrogametech Never boring Martin :) Taint That The Fuckin Truth!! Just A Stupid, Maybe Useless Idea. If The Chips Get Hot Why Not Try To Add A Small Fan Over Them? A VideoGameConsole Modder, Goes By MODDEDbyBACTERIA Uses Small Fans To Keep CPUs On His Handheld Consoles From Getting Too Hot. Maybe You Could Use A Multimeter And Run A Fan Over The Chips?
retrogametech I suggest before start desoldering the big chips you should find the power and ground of the Yamaha and Z80 chip and cut only those legs first and then power the whole thing up. Cut first the power of Yamaha then test, then if nothing cut ground of Yamaha then test. Cut z80 power and test and etc you should get something on the screen, since these boards do have some BIOS checking . (and install the bios of course...)
retrogametech i have a cdtv which had no video, turned out to be bad caps on the video board, it seems your issue with video may be similar as it seems your tv is picking up a signal, however no RGB from the video stage, with the sound it may be a similar issue, may be worth getting hold of a chip schematic and checking voltages on power pins and use a logic probe to test channel outputs if not just drop in another 2610 or 2608 which is similar
retrogametech take it you are going to desolder the yamaha chip and check below it? id agree that if the battery leaked it may well have leaked in below
retrogametech Good to hear. I thought there was a possibility you might have (wasnt sure). Hence my phrasing.
retrogametech Hey bro, first off you need to pick up a Unibios for that machine, you can get them on eBay for around 30 or type in Universe bios in google and you can find what Im talking about. With the unibios it will show you what is wrong and allow you to force the mvs into aes mode so you can still play the games. Very important other point is that the cart slot NEEDS TO be attached with the game in it, not just the board only
retrogametech Did you ever get this working? Ive done a recent repair to an MV1FZ but luckily I didnt have any battery acid  that stuff is really painful... I suspect you could have damaged tracks under the components nearby, it often doesnt stop just at the battery area and can damage the tracks underneath chips easily.
retrogametech So, even if you have bad ram chips you should get a warning on the system telling you this. I told Thomas the same thing, Ill make a quick vid for you guys showing you what I mean as I have one suffering from the same problems. The original bios wont allow you to change jack and it will not tell you whats going wrong except the cross hatch screen color pallet
retrogametech How do you deep clean a motherboard like that?
retrogametech I had the same problem with my MVS i got, I didnt have an JAMMA connector so i had to solder directly from the pins to the SCART. When i tried it on both of my TVs it switched to the channel but no picture, same problem as you. I then changed the sync pin on the scart from 20 to 19 and i got picture :).
retrogametech Probably worth swapping the capacitors with some new ones as the old ones might be broken. ASSEMberX has a good guide! watch?vUY5ouIXVQc
retrogametech A 10 minute quick update? Still watched the whole thing though
retrogametech Does it have to Port on the back of it for the MegaDrive MODEM?
retrogametech shut up and take my money!!!!!!!!!!!
retrogametech This is awesome, I was thinking on this days ago, its nice to know that actually it existed, but I wish I could have them in hands.
retrogametech I have one of the mini genesis version which is with its jap book called 16bit review its 2 carts one is virtua figher and other is comix zone.
retrogametech Damn I want one of these great little addition to my collection, how much do these go for whenever they pop up on places like ebay
retrogametech Those are so fing cool! Man id end up spending retarded amounts of money on those hahaha.
retrogametech Awww that is the cutest thing I have ever seen! I want one!!! :D
retrogametech Eggs....Sega.....oh, I see what you did there. You so silly, Sega!
retrogametech lol that is awesome, Id love to have a mini Dreamcast for my collection
retrogametech Haha no way. I didnt even know they existed. And its japanese model too. I must this collection.
retrogametech Thes are really cool collection of mini sega genesis, i know thes are rare tho, good find.
retrogametech can I borrow your shrink ray? :p
retrogametech Hows the game play on it? LOL
retrogametech Irony is the cord on them little pads is longer than the cords on my real pads :P
retrogametech do they have these for systems like the NES and SNES?
retrogametech How do you get these stuff? I live in Japan but those are impossible to find here...
retrogametech Lol, Ill need to find some video game related action figures to pose them with it XD
retrogametech Lol, that would be awesome! But imagine trying to keep track of all those tiny cartridges! :P
retrogametech you should make a video about it :)
retrogametech I had no idea they had all of the Sega consoles featured in such way. Looks like you got more to hunt down now.
retrogametech Haha, the Dreamcast even has its own miniature removable VMUs! WANT!! XD
retrogametech I want to tease you and call you a nerd, but Id be lying if I said I didnt want them too:) Oh know, now you need to get another one to display with the Power Base Converter. Was that genuine excitement in your voice when you snapped the Mega Drive and Mega CD together? I like the forced perspective view at the end.
retrogametech Does any one know any good ways to store xbox360 and ps3 games Does any one know any good shops in the UK to purchase a video game shelf like the one in this video?
retrogametech Congratulations on completing the set. When the panel opened up to reveal an actual scale expansion port edge connector, it was a little mindblowing. You almost expect it to have traces painted on.
retrogametech What are you talking about? I was happy to see them fitted together, and Im not even on the same continent.
retrogametech Congrats for finding that nice replica! Awesome video like always...I think Im going to turno on my megadrive and play some Sonic the Hedgehog. :P
retrogametech awesome...love how it all fits together, wow, that cartirdge is cool as hell, so detailed
retrogametech I use to work with plastic injection mold machines. Can you imagine how long it took to tool that mold for those miniature models.Cool, Thanks.
retrogametech Thats so cool. Technology being what it is these days, they could probably make a functional Megadrive clone that size. Id buy one :D
retrogametech Very cool, I have the mini version of the famicom and some games with boxes, its pretty neat
retrogametech Lol. Aww man... why did you have to go and point that out! You know my OCD tendencies mean Ill now have to go hunt down another just to display the Power Base! Haha. And yes, that was indeed some genuine unscripted nerdy excitement. Dont act like you wouldnt be the same! :P
retrogametech I got all the power wiring done after making this vid. Just got video and sound to do next. Taking my time and double checking everything as I go. So many unknownuntested variables to consider with something like this. But it is kinda fun! :) I really want to play those games on that cart now! I got the cart on eBay (what a surprise eh?). It was more or less the same price as a single sports game.
retrogametech Not decided yet. It kinda depends on if I can get it work right now. I might consider building a mini cab or making some sort of console style housing for it.
retrogametech Lucky you! I wish the AES wasnt so expensive! :P
retrogametech Just solder a wire from the start pad to the end of the track, in case the connection is no longer made on the board.
retrogametech I can almost guarantee there will be more hiccups. There always are! :P
retrogametech Thanks! fingers crossed I can revive it :)
retrogametech You can ask Luke anything and hell give you a cool long answer hes a retro legend!!!!!!!
retrogametech Awesome video as always!!! Cool project you got on your hands. These types of video are the best!!! Thanks!!!
retrogametech No worries dude! Ive already wired in an extra ground for it so will probably just throw a switch on there anyway. At least that way for future projects Ill not need to worry about it. All my power wiring is now done so Im going to attempt the Scart connections tonight. Thanks again for all the help so far!
retrogametech Remove any socketed chips (Like the bios) and give the board a good wash with soap and warm water using a toothbrush to scrub. Let it drip dry in the vertical position for 30 minutes then put it in the sun for about 2 hours. You might need to use canned air to get the water out from under the chips to dry good. Make sure the board is completely dry before powering it on again.
retrogametech Ive heard of people putting their PCBs in the dishwasher to achieve the same goal. Is this true, and is it sane to do so?
retrogametech Great vid man, looking forward to seeing it in action which Im sure you will, you sound determined lol. Its cool that you have fans willing enough to help you that are in the know with these types of things also cool that you gave the guy credit i bet he feels awesome right about now!. I am in need of some help I feel you might be the one to go to....you up for it?
retrogametech Thanks for the tips. Ive got it drip drying right now.
retrogametech Do you have to be a certain distance from the TV for it to work? I need to sit close as I cant see well!
retrogametech What keywords would you use in an eBay search? 3D LCD glasses? Shutter glasses? You didnt really specify or give a link.
retrogametech Awesome!! Love master system!!!
retrogametech Just search for 3D LCD shutter glasses. You should get a few hits.
retrogametech I know a lot of people who are huge fans of the SMS and want those 3D glasses, but not the price would love this! I am going to tell them about it, great stuff man.
retrogametech Excellent vid dude, nice heads up on the glasses :D
retrogametech Same here :) . I wonder how hard it would be to hack one of the wireless sets of glasses to work with the 3D adapter? That would be even cooler!
retrogametech I have a pair of the modern shutter glasses as well, and I can tell you that they are far more comfortable. I believe that most of the trouble with the SEGA 3D glasses actually comes from the adapter nowadays. I noticed that the image was affected by bumping the adapter one day, so I opened it up to see what was wrong. The metal contacts in the jack needed to be adjusted to make a better connection, and now both sets of glasses work great.
retrogametech Google Logisys CLK4WT2 4 Dual White Cold Cathode Kit those would of fit perfectly for what you needed. etherway keep up the great work.
retrogametech It was close! Literally less than a mm worth of clearance at just the right angle. I thought I was going to snap the ends off a few times :P Where to put it? I really have no idea! lol I dont have the space at the moment. Hopefully in future when I get a place with a dedicated games room it can go on display with the rest of my geeky tat! :) 1st world problems, eh?
retrogametech very nice light fix on the ngage sign i like your videos did you have to take the whole thing apart i guess that it was a project for you to do
retrogametech just an idea but how about printing the ngage cover of tombraider on projection paper ive printrd color presentations on that stuff and it looks cool really colorful stuff and hardly any detail is lost
retrogametech What would have been awesome, stick a cheap laptop in there, and run NGage emulated games on it. and also get the buttons to work too. and you have the worlds largest NGage!!!
retrogametech I would put Sonic N in there
retrogametech Great vid. Did you get the Duke Nuke Em cover out...?
retrogametech You have done a nice job but i think youve missed a real trick not listening to those people that suggested you put a video or photo player playing ngage images that would have been really cool.
retrogametech Hahaha, What is it with YouTubers always wanting to either grow or hide weed in my consolesmods? lol
retrogametech Looks great, well done.
retrogametech also, the L button skip thing: when you power cycle the ez4, it then tries to save from the nand memory to the sd card. if you skip it, boom goes your previous sessions saves. of course if you had saved earlier, then those will be available, just not the recent ones. gameboy and gameboy color games can be emulated with goomba and goombacolor.
retrogametech Im definitely picking one of these up, along with a Gameboy Micro :)
retrogametech Hi mate richard here that cart in your gba are u selling it i have a ds light and.just ordered a r4. Cart for ds games but want one to play the gba games on the ds gba slot
retrogametech I heard about things like this for the NES and SNES and stuff but is it possible to get flash carts like this for consoles such as N64?
retrogametech I do not have this, so I cannot say for sure, but it should be perfect, as it is not emulation. It is running them nativly, so everything should be 100 perfect
retrogametech Did you transfer the roms to your memory card with the EZFlash software using a PC? The ROMS need to be patched and the EZClient software also has to create a special folder with save files etc.
retrogametech I got my miniSD  microSD converter stuck in mine. Im still able to remove the microSD card inside, but I cannot get the converter out at all. Rather nice flashcart, software was fairly easy to use, etc. Make sure you dont skip the starting saver bit because that is it reading back from the SRAM and writing that to the SD card, it doesnt do direct to SD writes in game. If you skip it, next game you load will overwrite the SRAM. Where did you get that GBC one though?
retrogametech nice xbox in the background
retrogametech Will It work with Pokemon chaos black
retrogametech hey, u have the same gba sp as Tweeterman287s XD
retrogametech is the super card gba good?
retrogametech the reset option is good so you can save your game even if the battery is dead
retrogametech Has anyone used the Mother 3 english rom with this?
retrogametech any one have a source to buy these for gb
retrogametech does that software work on mac os x? Or only windows eh?
retrogametech I have almost 40 games for my GBA and hauling them all around with me really sucks because the case is about the size of a small purse. I feel ridiculous carrying it around with me. With this thing I can have all the games I own and dont own in one cart and leave all the other physical games at home. Having tons of cartridge games really destroys the portability of a console. I need one of these.
retrogametech I had an old Flashcart once. To put games on it you had to put the cart into a huge converter, plug it into the PC and use FTP to transfer games xD!
retrogametech I used to have a GBA with a flashcart but nowadays I use a modded PSP, the battery lasts way longer than the almost dead battery of my GBA, and the game compatibility is actually better, not to mention all the other consoles I can also play with it.
retrogametech Thanks, dude! I got the EZ from a Chinese site called ebluar. Although It seems to be down right now. The GB USB I bought from Kitsch Bent in the US. Both sources are very reliable :) (in my experience).
retrogametech i modded my ds lite so it only has a bottom screen. do you think it can run a snes emulator on this flash cart?
retrogametech I was aware of SFII, but just thought all these flash cards had these sort of issues. Will the EZ Flash play Monkey Ball Jr? I have never seen that game emulated correctly. Also, will the GB USB smart card work in a Micro? Really, the only reason I bought a Supercard was because I had a dinky little Micro,  I wanted everything all in one small portable handheld  no extra carts. I always wanted the Micro to be backwards compatible with the GBGBC anyway, smooth NES emulation was just a bonus.
GameSack Dear Game Sack ....hiThat is all xoxoxo
GameSack Distance between Saarbruecken and Arlington from 8080 miles is unfortunately too big for me... :(
GameSack Im gonna be at PRGE, but I cant get all the way to Texas!
GameSack Only people id wanna see is you guys. Wish Happy Console Gamer was gonna be there. Granted I live in texas so ill probably go.
GameSack Have fun there guys! And if you have time, when you get back, why not make a short video for those of us who cannot attend to let us know what you found there that was interesting. And thanks for the last video. I love how you guys tend to make every video these days at least 25 minutes long. They really are like episodes, and while I love genre videos, the console ones are my favorites!
GameSack wish i could go. you and alphaomegasin make it worth it
GameSack Just sold all my old systems, a part of me is sad and I always say to myself that I want to go back and play them, but I never really do. The few times I have gotten around to play old games, I just realise weve moved on so much and my childhood often gets ruined when I realise theyre actually bad. I remember loving MGS and it being my favourite game ever at the time, but going back........ just not a good game and I never even remembered it being only like 4 hours of actual gameplay lol.I miss my Dreamcast and N64 the most, but in reality Shenmue is just really bad and most N64 games have superior later versions. Goldeneye just isnt good any more and really Mario 64 and OoT have been surpassed and Mario Kart 64 is actually quite crap, Mario Kart 8 just looks so amazing.I have all these memories in my head of these games being amazing, I love watching them all back and remembering them, when it comes to playing though...... games today are a lot better, on the whole.
GameSack What were you guys laughing at just before this video started?
GameSack Dave, we can see right through you!
GameSack I hope to go and see you guys since I have family in Dallas If schoolwork permit!
GameSack what year!!!!???!!??!?
GameSack I wish I could meet you guys, but I live in Europe, so thats not going to happen :(
GameSack Would be cool if you could make it to PAX AUS. :)
GameSack Seriously, you guys a just middleaged men who are over obsessed with video games......hell ya I subscribed!
GameSack Bring me the state of Texas so I can join in.
GameSack I wish I lived in Texas. Well glad to hear you got in a convention. Hopefully this will bring in more people to appreciate this great show you guys make. Btw will you be doing a live broadcast of the show?
GameSack Neo geo the ultimate fighting console that every kid wanted but couldnt afford, so they rented it in a store. Or was i the only one
GameSack As I stated on their Facebook page a couple weeks ago, this is the only Youtube subscription I anticipate new videos on. For some reason I cant find my comment on their page anymore though....
GameSack Its been a few days since I watched this episode so forgive me if I am wrong. But I dont recall one platformer for this... platform. Were there any platformers for this platform at all? If so did you feature any in other episodes?
GameSack Crossed Swords always made me think about the Phantasy Star game battles, imagining both of those mixed together would be damn amazing 00
GameSack So jealous you have SVC Chaos on the AES. I just ordered it for the original XBOX today. Thats the real Capcom vs SNK that I think a lot of fans dont know exists. I dont understand why it hasnt been released digitally.
GameSack Fantastic episode as always, guys. I used to have the first top loader, but it kept resetting and going back to the CD player screen at random times. Was lucky enough to find an AES with a multi cart a few years ago, and never looked back. Does the CDZ have less of a failure rate?
GameSack Sweet Video guys, NEO GEO cd is the last console I want for my collection!
GameSack Did Dave just bch slapped Joe? XD
GameSack Im going to watch the super popular puzzle games episode. It was super popular after all.
GameSack I always choose the offensive orgy. ALWAYS. HA Great episode guys!
GameSack No no thank you for another great episode
GameSack Had a Neo Geo CD that I had to sell on ebay before college, broke my heart. My collection consisted of Real Bout Fatal Fury 1,2 and special, KOFs 9498, and Samurai Showdowns 14. The load times are so long you become immune to load times in general... sigh, I dont know if Ill ever love again.
GameSack Awesome as usual, Ive got a CDZ without a PSU (which im just getting around to sorting out), looks like a nice system.
GameSack Cool, lots of info on a system I knew very little about aside from the Neo Geo connection and the loading times (and Im not surprised to learn that theyre exaggerated).
GameSack The best vids on Youtube!!
GameSack Even though the cd is cheaper, is funny that the music is better in some games.
GameSack I love the time these guys put into their videos, its what separates them from a lot of the other reviewers.
GameSack Are there any Fighting Games on the Neo Geo CD?
GameSack Amazing episode ! You guys are the best ! Keep doing the amazing work! I almost bought the 1x cd read version back in 1995 here in Brazil, but I ended buying the Sega Saturn and didnt regret, as the Sega console also had lots of SNKs classics. And the loading times on the 1x cd rom version are really really annoying...
GameSack Awesome. I love these Neo Geo episodes. Keep up the great work guys!
GameSack Broadcast quality show here!
GameSack How often do episodes of gamesack come out, I started to miss u guys so I started watching older episodes... Again, huge fan of gamesack here!
GameSack Why would you rip video game music? I cant see the point. Seems a waste of time.
GameSack Where did you get the shirt Dave?
GameSack Id like to own a neo cd at some point, ive got AES and MVS in a candy cabinet. Prices are indeed out of reach for the most people on AES, but MVS is clearly the best option (just needs a supergun to be usable outside a cab). CDs just dont feel right for neo games, but then again its just my opinion. Still, a good addition to someones collection, its SNK hardware after all !
GameSack Are there any Fighting Games on the Neo Geo CD?
GameSack The neo geo cd has a reset just hold the four buttons and select.
GameSack You were able to point out the loading times on Last Blade in quite an amusing way.The skit at the end was priceless as well. Hope to see more, as with the X68000 comp as well!
GameSack One system that I hope you cover in the future is the MSX I havent played it but I heard that it has a lot of great games that never came out on any other systems, especially by Konami.
GameSack Why dont these dudes have more subscribers??
GameSack Come on dudes, Viewpoint is SO cool!
GameSack I love Samurai Shodown 4. I used to play it so much in the arcade. The first time when I beat it I felt like I was gonna crap myself because it was the first game I ever beat, also I was about 7 and I used an exploit on the last boss to beat him.. yea I wasnt really that good. :P
GameSack One of the best gaming channels on YouTube...they should have way more subscribers.
GameSack You guys are great yall need to do more episodes.
GameSack Golden axe shirt rocks. Arent you a Nintendo fan or did you have a change of heart in an episode I havent seen yet ?
GameSack i dont know...the neo geo neer really appealed to and after this i still say no the neo geo cd, honestly i am not a fan early to mid nineties cd based consuls...it is a good effort but the quality of the cds and (graphics arent eer thing) the loading times, I mean i just want to sit and play. what I do not like about the neo geo cd looks like well, it is a fighting arcade and i do not like that, aside from that all other games were either games that are a ripped off of other games to games that are already on other systems than and now. With that said this was another great episode and although it turned me away from the system and games it was still fun worth watching. Thank you guys and remember this is my thought and opinion so please do not hate
GameSack Funny video, was laughing the whole time. Can you upload more videos like this?
GameSack Justice whats your amour called in your youtube picture ? The third age looking armour :P
GameSack I expected many good games back then. Some of these games would actually do well in sales. It seems they felt discouraged about how well it would go.
GameSack VERY TENNISY HUH? hahah another great episode.
GameSack Almost 50k subscribers, and very well deserved. Congratulations gentlemen!
GameSack (Original post: Was my post deleted?)Sorry, it was gone... I even clicked all comments, expanded the whole page and CtrlFsearched for just my name, and could not find it. I have put thousands of hours into my retexture projects and gotten nothing in return so my frustration level can climb easily.GTG and thanks,Jay
GameSack You guys have the most consistent show on the internet. Ive been enjoying it for a long time. Now if only I could get me some of these Japanese games!
GameSack you guys should dedicate an episode to cave shooters :) lots of great region free japanese imports on the xbox 360 :) cave shooters are the best :) also 5pb made a really good region free shooter called bullet soul :)
GameSack The main character in the Agedama game looks kind of like Keith Courage. In fact, this game could probably be the sequel that the credits talked about!
GameSack Rudra no Hihou The Treasure of Rudra, one of Squaresofts obscure jewels from the last years of the Super Famicom (thus the probable reason It didnt make It to America as the N64 was just launched to sale for that time). I would also mention Pulseman but he came to America in 2009 via Wiis virtual console so, dunno if It counts:
GameSack Just subbed. Gonna help you hit 15k!
GameSack I like Daves hair because its like mine
GameSack These make me jealous sometimes that Japan gets so many inventive titles that dont make it out to the states. We never get to see bugs pissing rivers!Also, but kind of unrelated, doing some video reviews has revealed some interesting things about narration, like the importance of carefully pronouncing certain phrases like game mechanics (I bet you guys know what I mean!)...What do you guys think of my Legaia 2 review?Experiential Game Reviews: Legaia 2: Duel Saga
GameSack Super Tempo  Tryrush Deppy in ONE Episode!!NICE!!  (Both REALLY Rare and expensive...)
GameSack Great episode as always, I have played all of these games. JK ), I have played about 5 of them total I think. Magical Popn is definitely my favorite from this list, epic game.
GameSack Great episode as always, I have played all of these games. JK ), I have played about 5 of them total I think. Magical Popn is definitely my favorite from this list, epic game.
GameSack Dave White looks like a younger Eddie Fitzgerald.
GameSack Another entertaining episode that showed me a bunch of coollooking games Id never heard of. Id love to see my alltime favorite import, Blue Seed for the Sega Saturn, covered on one of these (assuming it wasnt covered in Left in Japan 1 or 2, since I havent gotten around to watching those yet).
GameSack Nice work on showing the PC Engine some more attention. For the next Left episode you can do even more PCE stuff. Lots of great games on that platform. From hucards to super cd to arcade card cd games like ports of neo geo games.
GameSack Another classic video! I keep on discovering new stuff thanks to you both!
GameSack Hey, I cared about the Sports episode, I enjoy every episode! I actually hope you guys make a 2nd sports one someday. Anyway, great episode, I really liked that outro bit, that one may have been one of my favorites so far.
GameSack Great episode. Needs more Koei.
GameSack More like Try Rush  DERPY!! OooooooOoOooOOooo.... sick burn. :P
GameSack I feel like Radical Dreamers should be on this series eventually. Not so heavy on gameplay, but damn the english translation is fantastic
GameSack You could probably do an entire episode on The Great Battle series released on the Famicom,SFC,Gameboy,PS1,NDS  PSP. There are also a ton of spinoff titles too, and theyre all pretty sweet!
GameSack Another great show. Tempo 2 looks pretty cool
GameSack here is an idea game sack...you can roll with or eh, the idea. Home brew video games, hacks, part 2 with a twist, throw some creepy pastas in there. Here are few creepy pastas, dead sonic, tails doll from sonic racing whom makes people who pla as tails doll commit suicide, pokemon lavender town, white hand, lavender town music and more. I really liked that home brew episode so i threw that idea in there. Aright Dave and Joe
GameSack wow you really did blast that girls top off. Thanks for putting these games on my radar.
GameSack Can anyone recommend more RPGs with camera angle as on 1:03 that are in English or at least English subtitles.
GameSack The only problem with the series are the hosts. I think they are into a different type of sack from a game one.
GameSack Be sure to like this video up! Lets get 500 Likes, like only if you enjoyed though! I will be blown away.
GameSack I hate bunjie now they dont seem to give a shit that they just abandoned halo their masterpiece , to turn to shit and they just go make Destiny which just looks like boarderlands (but more serious)
GameSack What I dont understand is how bungie feels that it understands the playstation community, and I dont think the Playstation community understands them either. The vast majority of Bungies fans are based on the xbox, and the remainder of them on PC, owning to Halo and bungies previous titles like myth. Theyve never made a game for them, and also the majority of playstation users will never have played Halo. So hundreds of thousands of Playstation players have preordered the game based solely on the fact that it was praised by critics at E3, and also that the development studio has made very popular games (Halo) in the past, that (vitally) they themselves actually havent had the opportunity to play. Who knows what they might be expecting, especially with all the hype? Most of them arent preordering the game because of their own experience with Bungies games, and that will cause some of the players to be dissapointed. All im saying is that a lot of them dont really know what to expect (gameplay wise) from Destiny, or from Bungie themselves. They might have all hyped themselves up for a game that just isnt their bag of chips, and that would be a shame for the reviews and the reputation of Bungie.I didnt mean this comment to be hateful in any way, and am just concerned about how quickly the community size on that platform may decline. Id like to hear anyone elses opinions on this.
GameSack When they say about the cities not being of our own creation, could they not be referring to Humanity? As in these cities are made by the enemies in destiny.
GameSack Who preorderd the beta!
GameSack You should make a fantasy league with subs
GameSack I hate headlinestitles that end in a question mark?
GameSack That champ is a beast
GameSack YouTube reverse field
GameSack Mut  MyTeam are full of quitters and btches man like does anyone play a game through does anyone not try and cheese the whole game
GameSack http:www.twitch.tvthatdcoop
GameSack Ugh. US SNES is ugly. My PS1 would only bang EU or JP one.
GameSack I never want to see this again
GameSack The silly as fuck sound effects are the icing on the cake.
GameSack ...what the hell did I just watch?
GameSack So this is why ya havent made a video in a while? Need ideas or something? smh
GameSack What the hell did I just watch?!? D
GameSack Joe your sexual fantasies with consoles are creative and scary at the same time,... by the way you missed the part when the snes got rape to dead by the ps1, and the same thing with the nintendo 64 and game cube by the ps1 and ps2..., damn nintendo got gang raped too bad by sony... thats got to hurt
GameSack Is the playstation trying to have sex with the SNES? explain this shit!
GameSack This actually made me laugh pretty hardLove you two!
GameSack Once is enough for me. O.o
GameSack Aa errr u hmm hmm..scratches head
GameSack what did I just watch?
GameSack I havent been this confused since I saw the new ninja turtles trailer
GameSack THANKS,me and my PS2 were looking for some console on console soft action! could you do a hardcore one? or even maybe human on console? thnx
GameSack Looool.That is awkward. You ruined the consoles image :p
GameSack i feel like a psone joke was missing.
GameSack This is really perverted plastic on plastic awesome camera work
GameSack lol console pornography
GameSack better love story than twilight
GameSack I feel like I need a shower...
GameSack That was a..... thing.
GameSack Never though I would see an SNES and PS1 doing the nasty LOL!
GameSack That was fuckin hilarious. I consider this the cowbell of videos. And we need more. More cowbell.
GameSack PlayStation vs Super Nintendo !
GameSack console sex YEAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
GameSack 1:50 Heyy! Didnt know that the MajesticSix from Crysis 2 and 3 was in this game! Seems all big revolvers look the same these days...
GameSack All things holy considered? The Binding of Isaac.
GameSack if the ps1 is not working right, You dont have to turn the ps1 upside down because thats not necessary you can turn it around on either the left side or right side also have something to hold your ps1 so it wont fall and it works perfectly on my fat ps1 just to make it easier and wont have a hard time changing the disc.
GameSack they overlap but the PS1 was the first of the new generation and the DC was the last of the old generation. sony changed everything when they got involved and sega changed everything when they dropped out.
GameSack I actually played Total Eclipse Turbo today :o creppy
GameSack you can make the screen follow spyro you know its a setting in the game all three for the playstation have that
GameSack rayman, rayman 2, the coolboarders series and pacman 3d were some of my favourite games as a kid that werent already mentioned
GameSack playstation easily has the best controllers.
GameSack I really hope to see more console focused videos from you guys. The others are definitely good but the main reason i got kind of obsessed with this channel is because of the Dreamcast and Saturn episodes.
GameSack y u no mention Metal Gear Solid?
GameSack tenchu? wheres tenchu!!!
GameSack My eyes are offended by the hosts
GameSack Time Crisis is way better than Virtua Cop
GameSack ohh my god did the playstation and a lower class nintendo system just have sex
GameSack How would you know to turn you Playstation upside down with out internet?
GameSack Hat du bogg mit mir viedo zu machen
GameSack WHY wasnt ristar here
GameSack Did these clowns honestly just say sonic wasntshouldnt have been a staple mascot? Theyll let anyone have a YouTube channel these days.
GameSack a friend sold me a Croc for GBC back in the day, but I dont remember which one, it was decent.
GameSack Crash Bandicoot  Spyro the Dragon.And who could forget Original the Character?
GameSack Id love to see you guys tackle on the modern mascots.
GameSack Vector mans design was just a placeholder at first but then they decided that they liked him or something of that such.
GameSack Chibi robo was more than just a cleaning sim cleaning was just an incentive to get money, the 4inch tall robot helped a marriage from falling apart, help a little girl cope with fighting dysfunctional parents,reunited friends, enkindled interesting romances, contacted aliens, discovered a unique source of power, traveled through time not to mention it had the quirkiness of story straight out of the Mother series. Them the music: the background music blended in with fact that all the actions chibi did had unique musical sound effects from moving from the different surfaces to the different tools chibi used.... all that and you seriously called it boring ?!?
GameSack Vectorman and Billy Hatcher are side series, not mascots. People gotta do research before recording themselves play games.
GameSack Jersey Devil, and Blinx..
GameSack I cringed so hard when he said you shouldnt buy ChibiRobo. If you actually play the game and just keep cleaning as a side extrapoints you can eventually have a battery that never runs out. The story is extremely charming especially when you travel through time with aliens. I understand that some people may not like the game but thats no reason to completely bash it. I personally really dislike Pikmin. does that mean its a crap game that nobody should buy?  No, Im fine with you saying its a failed mascot(even though they made a new game a couple months ago), but to say that you shouldnt even purchase the game even for cheap was far too extreme.
GameSack The only one I was actually expecting to see in this wasnt here which was surprising... Spyro the Dragon lol
GameSack Dave, isnt Samba actually called Amigo?
GameSack I realized three things. 1. These guys have no clue what a mascot is. 2. Someone never completed the Spydorz story in ChibiRobo. 3. This show is really mean spirited and opinionated.
GameSack i love billy hatcher anD th giant egg
GameSack In Captain Commando you have to input special commands for additional attacks. Read an FAQ or something at least if youre going to do a video on it.
GameSack Master Higgins and Wonder boy
GameSack Cant believe Ive never heard of Socket. I want.
GameSack What you mean by Shrek, its names actually Baron Dante.
GameSack I cant believe you forgot about that bat thing from Sunsoft!
GameSack Not all of these are mascots.
GameSack Hilarious! Great job!!
GameSack Das nukular ist der Knaller! Schn gemacht 3
GameSack No ChronoTrigger? Unsubbed, reported, blocked, unfriended, deported, extradited, hexed, fatwad, Barbara Streisand.
GameSack I never understood how people generally prefer Revenge of Shinobi to Shinobi III, I just dont.
GameSack Making top10s of the 8bit, 64bit and GameBoy times will probably break you guys down.Good luck though, I enjoyed the video even though there were other games in my list.
GameSack I love the sound track to Road Rash...the way the Mega DriveGenesis tried to do guitar sounds great to me! :D
GameSack My favorite YouTube channel congrats thanks for the many good looks at many great and fairly decent games and systems
GameSack Riley  Appearing in Revenge of Shinobi several years before his appearance in Call of Duty: Ghosts.
GameSack Say it as it is........You forgot to mention Streets of Rage 2.....Just say it... The problem with your taste is that its not even a taste to begin with.....
GameSack Awsome new intro guys ! :)
GameSack Shining Force II should be number one! I know that its niche, but its sadly overlooked!
GameSack No Super Metroid?Loss of all nerd cred
GameSack Please do more top tens!
GameSack I have Road Rash in my top 5 favorite 16bit games, I even bought the EA Replay for PSP just to play Road Rash on the go, but sadly the original music isnt there on the PSP version.
GameSack best Game Sack opening ever
GameSack Congrats on 100 episodes!!! I think Gaiares looks more like a Thunder Force II upgrade,and also why wasnt any of the Sonic games on the list?
GameSack Great show guys! Really enjoyed the special intro! Interesting choices in the list. Surprised there was no version of Street Fighter II on either list but the 1 on 1 fighting genre doesnt seem to really be the top choice for either of you guys.
GameSack Great show guys! Really enjoyed the special intro! Interesting choices in the list. Surprised there was no version of Street Fighter II on either list but the 1 on 1 fighting genre doesnt seem to really be the top choice for either of you guys.
GameSack 1 is Final Fantasy VI.pretty much a no brainer
GameSack You guys didnt mention how you can change the turtles skin color in Turtles IV so that they match the action figures! Have you been checking your options menu?
GameSack Original choices, honorable mentions.... good stuff.
GameSack Ha ha ha. Loved the Super Metroid bit at the end. In fact, your little epilogues at the end of your videos routinely make me laugh out loud. (Watched the Sharp X68000 one last night, and I loved the delivery at the end.)
GameSack No russian subtitles? Motherfuckers!
GameSack correct me if im wrong but I believe Battletoads did the whole throw the enemy at the screen to beat the boss thing 1st.....not tmnt.
GameSack Wow these guys are faggots
GameSack Isnt that the bad guy from Altered Beast in Super Castlevania 4? he is on the hallway where the torches light up
GameSack Can anybody who had the patience to wait through that crap ass intro give me the rundown...
GameSack I really think you guys keep getting better and better! I cannot wait for the next 100!
GameSack 1:24 1:47 thats one big sack
GameSack I have a link to the past and mario world and super metroid on the WiiU VC
GameSack Nice list guys!! I agree with most of it
GameSack ranma yes best fighter ever lol.
GameSack You can go into the options of Ranma 12 and set up for jump, but it should have been jump to begin with after all.
GameSack Really had enjoyment with trutles too. It was a strong fighter.
GameSack Surprised there was no Primal Rage.
GameSack Clay Fighter tournament edition was quite better than the first one. Hey how about Primal Rage?
GameSack Hah, is Dave getting burnt out on gamesack?
GameSack Oh my god, why is Gosunkugi fighting against Akane???
GameSack never thought Strip Fighter was an actual game...
GameSack What no wipeout?!? You monsters!
GameSack gamesack is awesome x.x
GameSack Watch Dragon ball z you will love it
GameSack Where the fuck is King of Fighters?
GameSack You missed World Heroes. Pretty much a Street Fighter rip off but it was really fun. The second one especiallly.
GameSack i got that clay fighter for the snes you right that game gets old fast lol. great video best believe ill be there for the next video as well
GameSack Shaq Fu, Power Rangers, Fatal Fury, and Final Fight are pretty glaring omissions for better or worse.
GameSack If there is a next time? who knows? Mmm is this potentially the last ever episode then?
GameSack Virtua Fighter  The beginning of Tekken
GameSack World Heroes and Super Variable Geo for the Super Famicom.
GameSack Having played DB Budokai 2 to the death back in the day when my cousin had it, I can tell you the game has dash key. L or R I think to dash left or right, you can make a homing fireball chase you and lead it back to the guy who shot it. I agree its not... really a good game at the time but I have to give it credit for having a beam clash system, not only superior to the cheat sword clash system that Samurai Shodown failed to implement correctly, but really makes the game like its source material. :3
GameSack Ive seen Game Sack almost always rag on graphics, especially early 3d ones, but in my opinion graphics are only bad if they hinder your playing experience.
GameSack What about Amiga fighters? Shadow Fighter, Elfmania, FIghtin Spirit? Each of these was in my opinion far better (gfxwise, at least) than the games covered here.
GameSack Satuday Night Slammasters. Its a fighting game with prowrestling elements and it has Haggar from Final Fight. It also has a connection to Street Fighter.
GameSack I remember back in the day I would try to play every single fighting game that came out because I thought they were ALL awesome...but after watching this video I see that most of the fighting games that werent made by capcom or snk were garbage. I was so jealous of eternal champions since I didnt have a sega. Not so much now....
GameSack some SNK boss Syndrome, you guys outta talk about that one day
GameSack My problem with some of the 16bit fighters (Eternal Champions, Art of Fighting, the Karnov one, in example) is that I dont even get to know if I suck or not, because I can barely move! You start your first fight in a game you dont even know, and the A.I counterattacks EVERYTHING you do, stuns you, get close and kill you. I hate that kind of games.
GameSack There was a halfway descent fighting game for the SNES  SFC called Ultimate Fighter (or Hiryuu No Ken in Japan). Its part side scroller  part fighting game. Another half way descent game was Deadly Moves for the Sega Genesis. The main mode you were limited to only playing as the main character (Joe), but in Vs Mode, you could choose to play as the others. I never played Power Moves for the SNES, but I understand it was the same game with a different name.I also liked playing Clay Fighter  Killer Instinct. I managed to kill some time playing Eternal Champions. I have always thought of it as a poor mans Street Fighter 2 game. Im surprised you didnt mention the fact that your special moves were limited by the amount of inner strength you had  that when you insult your opponent, it drains their inner strength. That to me is what made E.C. so difficult to play. Xavier was my favorite character because he could change opponents into other characters.
GameSack do you guys consider neogeo 16bit or 24bit?
GameSack Where the fuck is Fatal Fury...?You do not know a fuck.
GameSack tekken 3 actually had a 2d fighting game
GameSack 1:30, you can see his balls...
GameSack I noticed that when I miss my shots I swear like crazy
GameSack Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed the videos!
GameSack Night Slashers was such a badass game to me when I was little, horror beat em up? Fuck yeah and then some :D Would love to see this somehow show up on PSNXBLA or anywhere possible for a rerelease
GameSack Guys great channel just found you and subed
GameSack Could you do Jazz Jackrabbit (first for DOS, couldnt care less for JJ2) review, please?
GameSack Great episode. I want to play Night Slasher so badly now.
GameSack great episode! nice choose of arcade games!, arcade hidden gems..
GameSack 14:30  ok, but before I convince data east, I need to convince SEGA not to do a surprise US Saturn launch alienating developerspublishersretailers so data east will actually WANT to bring it to the Saturn for a stateside release.
GameSack Blood Bros....the inspiration for NATSUMEs Wild Guns on the Super Nintendo? If not, its sure close.
GameSack Blood Bros. kinda reminds me of Wild Guns.
GameSack Wow, nice looking games Ive never seen before good review guys.
GameSack Alligator Hunt by Gaelco
GameSack Thanks Game Sack. How bout those Broncos? Lol
GameSack Youve got that right... i was looking at Mystic Warriors and lusting for it...
GameSack Would love to play bucky o hare.
GameSack Theres a super fun arcade beatemup called Vendetta that never got a home release (as far as I know). Its challenging at first, but once you learn the bosses patterns you can get pretty far in the game on a single credit.The controls are great, and the special moves are easy to pull off. They dont drain your life bar, and yet dont unbalance the game. The Japanese version actually includes fetish villains wearing leather chaps who attack you by trying to hump you...!I could die happy if you included this game in your next Left in the Arcade!
GameSack Game Sack  a must watch for me these days. Thanks fellas, also recommending you to friends.
GameSack 13:05 That really is total badass! Same goes for all the little details!By the way, Merry Christmas! XD
GameSack At home on the Sega Dreamcast where they belong. Not the Sega Saturn
GameSack Wild guns from natsume on the snes seems like a spiritual succesor to blood bros. except no goofy cabal dance XD
GameSack most of those games are on home system
GameSack Where do you guys get all your cool shirts? Do you Make them? Do you buy them? If so, where?
GameSack hey can you guys look for an arcade game that i played when i was young, but i cant remember the name. its a isometric shoot em up with repitlianlizardmen bad guys i think. there were different weapons you could get and i think you could even fly in some sort of ship. the landscape reminded me of levels in marble madness. also i think the title had a very scifi ring to it, kinda like planet of the lizard people in 3D or something. have you come across that ever? keep up the good work.
GameSack I played Battletoads, which was at one arcade I went to once in a while. From what Ive read, it wasnt in wide release. Dont recall seeing any of the others, but I didnt start going to arcades a lot until 1994.That slanted elevator level at 7:53 was also used in one of the Ninja Turtles games, either 3 or 4, dont remember which.
GameSack Without your mouse you cant point out soft beards :
GameSack awe sweetie. 3 Great vid as per the usual!
GameSack Wheres for immortal sisters
GameSack Thanks for showcasing them! some great gametypes were added!
GameSack Ill do the series thing, but is it alright if Raps and I are on a team? Hes q YouTuber, Im a semi competitive player, we hell each other out, we get burgers, he comes back to my place, we get it on for the rest of the night with H4
GameSack The 2v2 thing sounds cool man, good commentary btw!
GameSack oooh ooh! Can I be one of the semicompetitive player on one of the teams? GT is HAGSTROMS if you wanna make sure Im decent at the game.
GameSack Couldnt get a hang of paintball, husky raid was pretty cool though.
GameSack Im will to do it if your willing to teach)
GameSack that gametype is so much fun. And i so much look forward to seeing you do competitive games :) your be a beast 3
GameSack 2V2? can you pleeease kick some butt here? :D http:halocustoms.comthreads2v2tournamentsignups.14950
GameSack The background music is excellent.
GameSack Thank Satan for emulators...
GameSack That is one amazing PC. A real shame they demand such prices.
GameSack 22:40This is one of the coolest things Ive seen.
GameSack Id love to see a MSX episode, as it was the home of the first games of the Metal Gear Solid franchise. Also Ive heard the MSX was used as guiding system for the missiles of the Brazilian army. Thats a very warring computer right there.
GameSack SharpX68000 master race
GameSack The US version of Space Harrier for the C64 also used stripes instead of a checkerboard floor. Of course the EuropeanUK one just had a plain gray floor.
GameSack Because losers do not play THE COCKPIT!
GameSack Awesome ending!! I laughted a lot!
GameSack 16.02  16.58 : You are just being hilariously sarcastic in terms of gameplay and the use of double entendre, right?
GameSack Why thunder force 2 on the X68000 looks the same as on the genesis is because they both use the Motorola 68000 Video chip
GameSack Really great piece of retro gear I never knew existed! Thanks for another great episode guys. Really want to get one of these now! Love all the external nonsense you can hook up to it. MIDI ftw! P lol
GameSack some sega games looked like they had scaling. they played it off pretty good.
GameSack I learned more on this channel than in school. I know you guys mostly do retro game reviews, but I was wondering what your opinions are on the next generation systems that recently released.
GameSack Game Sack is the shiznit o bam Sally!
GameSack great episode guys. i always look foreword to what you will review next. i wish that you included the Fatal Fury games from this episode so i can compare them with the NeoGeo ones. that reminds me, when will you do an exclusive NeoGeo episode? you should think about doing something similar to that and review every system out there. it would make one hell of an episode. keep up the good work guys. and thanks for making YouTube more awesome.
GameSack Cant believe you havent mentioned ChoRenSha 68k
GameSack The mecha in Mad Stalker totally looks like a Kampfer from Gundam: 0080.
GameSack Super mario Special is on the sharp x68000 i think
GameSack I love how big and intricate the game boxes are.
GameSack How about the Amiga 500? Or an episode devoted to the Turrican series!
GameSack Id buy one, but I dont know, its pretty expensive.
GameSack Your videos are simply awesome! This is the best video ive seen regarding the X68000. I was wondering though, do you actually own all the X68000 systems that were shown in this video, or were they just on loan? And Thank You for making the best game show on youtube. I hope it continues on for many years!
GameSack MORE... MORE... MOOOOOREEE...
GameSack Well, the Capcom ports are near arcade since, aside from developing their earlier arcade games on Moto 68000 machines, the CPS1 and 2 arcade cabinets ran on max out versions of essentially what went into the X68000 at 10 and 16MHz respectively.
GameSack I laughed way too hard when Joe got his Snatcher back :)
GameSack LOL at the end skit. Another great video fellas!
GameSack neat system but not worth blowing 200
GameSack Mr. Bloopy Jelly Boy brought Puty Squad to my mind for some reason.
GameSack I didnt think that death valley rally was that bad. A bit tedious in terms of platforming but was still enoyable
GameSack 2:43 inspired meatwad? lol
GameSack am i the only one who heard the music around 4:40 and thought it sounded like weird als dare to be stupid?
GameSack I love your guys videos. Nice, clean and simple. No need for overthetop graphics, screaming, yelling or unneeded profanity. I love getting right down to the games and giving the info I want. Keep up the good work.
GameSack Oh my god, Dave in a Fugazi shirt 3  3
GameSack marios wacky worlds of course!
GameSack If you enter the wrong password it tells you to be different I dont wanna be different! XD
GameSack Joe does looks like a Wookiee but less hairy.
GameSack Cant believe you forgot Propeller Arena on the Dreamcast... :(
GameSack LMAO  nuts on your chin
GameSack Joe and Dave  pleeeeeeease do an episode on Resident Evil! Like, you could do an episode on RE 1, then RE 2, then RE 3, code veronica, REmake gamecube and zero(but please dont talk much about 5 and 6)!! And maybe Silent Hill!! I want to hear your take on these classics!! Awesome show keep up the great work!
GameSack Everyone who disliked this, be different!
GameSack Mr Nutz Hopping mad was released for the Amiga
GameSack Tim Follin music can save any game.
GameSack Dont know if its been mentioned  but the Mr.Nutz prototype on the Megadrive was actually a port of the original Amiga version that came out previously.The released SNES and Megadrive versions that managed to get into the shops were vastly different!
GameSack jim powers background makes me dizzy.
GameSack Nice Fugazi shirt, love the show.
GameSack Earthbound(nes) also known as Eathbound Zero due to the second game being released on the SNES under that same title
GameSack Fugazi shirt????? SICK

GameSack zombiewizard they do have xbox live but there friends list are full oo pss I stalk you guys smosh in your sleep. Jk maybe not oo
GameSack Love all videos of grand theft auto 5
GameSack You guys need to step up your game to get on par with other gamers on YouTube... you dont even look, sound or seem like youre enjoying what youre playing. Also, relying on random cut aways for comedy is not that effective. I think Smosh might want to start looking for some more entertaining commentators soon. Just my opinion.
GameSack I want you to play freeroam on multiplayer not this it sucks
GameSack Its not even a play ground Joven xD
GameSack you guys should do last one standing where everyone is against each other and trying to kill each other and the last one standing wins
GameSack I want gta sooo bad...its still so freakin expensive!

GameSack Sohinki is like so calm during the game and joven and laser corn are like infinite rage
GameSack 3rd is the one with the hairy chest
GameSack Hehehe nice thing you got there xD
GameSack The pastel color scheme makes it seem cheap.
GameSack Hehe! Funny episode. I especially liked the part where Joe had that tower of extensions.
GameSack Joe and Dave, you are both awesome. Thanks for another fun video!
GameSack I dont get it. Its emulation anyway so why not just use an android device...?
GameSack Theres another Adapter, the Retro Port Adapter. It can replace the Retro Port Adapter the system comes with,
GameSack Whats the music playing at 7:39? Its so familiar but I cant remember its name.
GameSack Does it work with the Sega CD? lol.
GameSack How did the leaning tower of swaying power no snap anything I kept going OO as it kept getting bigger and taller and swayed further!
GameSack can you compare it to the Supaboy?
GameSack awesome video!The portable Sonic Tower was funny.Also,really amazing to see Genesis games running on SNES.
GameSack Hi Guys! I have enjoyed watching your show, and I love video game. I have played a lot of games and I have now a PlayStation 2 and I think that I would switch to a Sega Saturn console or a Super Nintendo Entertainment System console. I take this opportunity to wish you a happy New year 2014, and see you in the next year.
GameSack I love you guys so much! The best show ever. Happy old year.
GameSack Would you be able to play Kabuki Quantum Fighter on the Retro Duo Portable?
GameSack I laughed my ass off at 4.45
GameSack To be honest, if you have a PSP, you can emulate all these games on that
GameSack On the subject of SNES compatibility, how does Super Ghouls and Ghosts look? On other RetroBit consoles Ive owned, the 2nd boss is invisible! The same problem happens with another Capcom game, Magical Quest starring Mickey Mouse
GameSack Rastan?! I own the original arcade cabinet (and it works)!
GameSack hahahahah!! daves face when joe says hes the best of the duo made my day
GameSack The music on the title screen of Super Mario Odyssey is a remix of Chronologie 4 by Jean Michel Jarre... I know because its one of my favorite pieces of music in history :)
GameSack Of all the game sacks in the world, youre the game sackiest.Not sure if you guys have mentioned it before, but have you ever played Sweet Home on the Famicom? Its totally awesome. I only ask because theres a repro cart available now.
GameSack I know you guys dont cover PC game, but as Dave is a Nintendo fan, he should check Dangeros Dave in Copyright Infringement from ID Software for Nintendo. (and it history of why it was impressive) )watch?vcj4HJkeQSg0
GameSack Great episode! Daves shirt is AWESOME!!! Any chance on you guys doing a Phantasy Star or Soul Series episode?
GameSack OMG, I know that MOD file in that 32X game... its Guitar Slinger! I remember making a little song of my own with the samples in it! Joe, if you like MOD files, you should look at my channel... I write all of my music in IT format.
GameSack I hope you guys dont stop doing these for a long time.
GameSack On some of your game footage theres a really high pitched sound that hurts my sensitive ears for some reason. Its a bit annoying, and I guess theres nothing to do about it.
GameSack The English fan translation of hideo kojimas policenauts on ps1 is a must play particularly if you enjoyed snatcher
GameSack Battle Kid is inspired by I Wanna Be The Guy, a satirical super difficult platformer for the PC from 2009. If you didnt hear about IWBTG then shame on you!
GameSack i really like pokemon light platinum
GameSack I managed to pick up a reproduction copy of Secret of Mana 2 for a decent price. Looking forward to playing when I have some free time.
GameSack so cool guys you should definitely make more of these episodes I recommend the dreamcast for homebrew as it has a thriving community and plenty of awesome games made by that community.
GameSack There is a Kriss Kross game on Sega CD? Wow, I lucked out by not knowing that until now.
GameSack my favorite fantranslation of any game is still Mother 3although i do have to admit i was amused by the Finnish translation ofChrono Trigger haha..
GameSack In terms of hacks, Im surprised you didnt cover the SSBB mod Project M.
GameSack Speaking of Bad Apple, I wonder if Joes played Touhou much.
GameSack I laughed at how Tonguemans Logic is ripping off the Gunstar Heroes spinning logo xD
GameSack Try out challenging lolo (a hack of the adventures of lolo) if you like truly brain wrecking puzzles.
GameSack Im not having great luck tracking down the Castlevania 2 rom hack mentioned that was released by Biscuit. Any pointers?
GameSack Theres hacks of Sonic 2 and Sonic CD where theyve added the homing attack. Its a ton of fun annihilating everything. But it does take skill, you cant just spam it, otherwise you could launch yourself into spikes, pits, or enemies.
GameSack Man, where do you guys get all your amazing shirts? I really want a Dreamcast shirt! :D
GameSack Jajajajaa Mojon Twins means, means Dung Twins.Mojn is the word for dung in spanish.
GameSack Mario Odissey has Jarres music in the title...sweet.
GameSack Hahaha is that Persona 4 Arena music playing in the background?
GameSack i laphed so hard at this

GameSack Those look like hands. Not presents.
GameSack Sack a fool, hire a fool.. Ah well. Can we break that like button? GameDevTycoon
GameSack Cant you do two episodes everyday or make the videos longer please I would love that
GameSack I am no longer reading the comments on this video. Theyre of very poor quality. Mainly just accusing us of forgetting games. Guys, we cant read your minds and include exactly the games YOU want each episode. Its very frustrating to read comments saying You forgot  or How could you not include ? or No ? Im so disappointed!. Were definitely fine with people suggesting games for future installments or suggesting we try certain games (which a lot of you have been doing, thanks!) but the whining is not cool at all. So I probably wont be reading nor responding to any more comments on this particular video. I can now understand why AVGN doesnt comment on his videos any more. Well continue to include the games we want to include. Apologies to all of the really cool fans (which are most of you) for this. We really like you guys! Feel free to talk to us on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. :)
GameSack To be honest, Gameday 98 revolutionized football games.
GameSack No sports game list is complete without NHL 94, or Punchout, or any Mario sports games.
GameSack Kinda missing NBA Jam and NHL Hitz 2003, those are great arcade sports games.Also I quite enjoy racing sports games like the F1, Moto GP and DTM Race Driver series.
GameSack My favorite is probably Neo Turf Masters.ON THE GREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN!
GameSack Wow, I cant believe you made an episode that was about sports AND was entertaining.10 John Maddens out of 10 guys.
GameSack You guys are legit :D
GameSack Ive always liked FIFAgames and some NHL ones too BUT my absolute favorite sports game ever must be NBA Street series (from 1 to v3)
GameSack Expect this to be your guys lowestviewed video haha
GameSack Oh man...Tommy Lasorda baseball was the best...
GameSack No mention of any NHL games? Thats downright criminal!
GameSack My favorite NES sports games were Blades of Steel (which lets you play Gradius during intermission), Baseball Stars, and Punch Out. I had NFL Quarterback Club on SNES which was fun, oh and Wayne Gretzky and the NHLPA All Stars.
GameSack For a long period, really the only video games I played were sports games (mostly football). After I played Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, I got back into other genres (always loved the arcade classics though!).
GameSack Hopefully in part 2 you guys do nba jam and nfl blitz , great games.
GameSack My favorite NES sports games were Blades of Steel (which lets you play Gradius during intermission), Baseball Stars, and Punch Out. I had NFL Quarterback Club on SNES which was fun, oh and Wayne Gretzky and the NHLPA All Stars.
GameSack Only sportgame worth playing is the Punch Out series!
GameSack did you have to pay the WR to recieve your love?
GameSack Cant believe you overlooked Super Tecmo Bowl for the NES. Best of the series, Dave!
GameSack Obviously you guys are not sport game fans and that is fine...i get it but to enjoy a game because it is Easy vs More Challenging is like talking to my 12 year old. Hey son why dont you like this game? Because it is too hard and I want to win every time. Well sometimes you need to learn how to beat and strategize, Son. I dont want to...it should be easy. Ha! To each their own but this review was almost pointless because you do not go deep enough to explain (besides graphics and easyness of the game)  like a kid reviewing a game. Where as say Madden(which I agree is an abomination now) didnt just update graphics and add teams but added stats, season long stats, leader boards, etc...the thing most sport fans enjoy. Same as EAs BBall series. It started as a plain lets play 5 on 5 Bball and by the end of the Genesis era you could trade players, create players, track career stats, etc...which for that genre was a BIG deal. But due to the lack of your knowledge you focus on the Silly music in the first game and claim that is the best one. Same thing with the Tecmo series. Yes the first one was fine but so shallow. Tecmo Super Bowl 3 is more complex but it is leaps and bounds better than the original IMHO. I think you guys are better off not even doing this video. Its like a nonRPG player reviewing the 8bit and 16bit consoles in the same time span. Well I didnt like FFIII because it was just too complex and deep. Ill stick with whatever the 1st RPG game was because they wore funny clothes and I could beat it easily.I did enjoy your Recent Japan PC Game console  I forget the name.
GameSack Wassup guys come check out some of my vintage game finds from the sunshine state! !!
GameSack Best Game Sack ending ever. It had me in stitches.
GameSack Not at all a fan of sports games, as much of a sports fan as I am. They try so hard to be realistic they took out the fun. The most fun I had in a sports game: Hot Shots Golf 3, and I cant stand watching real golf, but this game is fun and doesnt take itself seriously.
GameSack mutant league football and hockey! deion Sanders sports talk football!
GameSack Great video as always. I think you should try international superstar soccer series, there are 2 for the snes and one of these for the genesis, these games have beautiful graphics, great gameplay, and to me its the best soccer series of the 16 bits era, if you play these games i hope you enjoy them.
GameSack LMAO I forgot about the Madden ambulance. So funny
GameSack al realy fucking good
GameSack The best sports game is NBA 2k14
GameSack Was fr ne graka und was fr ein Prozessor hast du?
GameSack Jo Marcel ich wollte dir sagen dein Ts Server geht wieder und ich bin drinnen )
GameSack Give it a few months after it happens. Itll revert soon enough.
GameSack Least itll show skill rather than people who have Dragon Rulers and win.
GameSack When they say the Americas, they are probably talking about North and South America. Silly azneyes
GameSack they should give everyone the same structure deck for the double digit rounds
GameSack I can argue with that. The stacks get passed around, so everyone gets a fair chance since you dont get to keep all the best cards from your pack, just one at a time.
GameSack maybe they could have a selected amount of cards that will be allowed to use in this draft and then you will have to construct them that way everyone will have acess to the same cards
GameSack I wouldve made it a side event..
GameSack Also, azneyes is bad at Geography as well as mathget your shit together broski
GameSack I like this because some asshole cant spend money on a top meta. It works more around strategy of the player. If you get enough packs for a 40 card deck, the chances of getting nothing are so slim.
GameSack I agree they need to do something. I beleive the last straw was when EVERYONE started showing up with dragons. Talk about boring. Dont agreee.....then you people that go to these events give Konami suggestions. But jesus talk about luck of the draw using unopened packs.
GameSack Your description of Draft Format is incorrect.
GameSack sorry AznEyesWhiteDragon but drafting is NOT like a prerelease. in a prerelease you play sealed format meaning you make a deck out of the cards in the packs u get a draft is an entirely different format. You sit in a group around a table and then you all open your pack at once, then you each select ONE card and put it in a pile for ur deck face down. then you pass the rest of the cards to the next player! and continue this till all the cards are taken. this is a highly skill oriented format and you can not possibly just open good cards as you will only get 2 or 3 cards from the same pack and people will take the second best and so on before that pack comes back to you. this is good for the game, people need to stop blindly hating.
GameSack Draft isnt just open the packs yourself and build a deck.
GameSack Probably a horrible idea but lawlsy to the very least.
GameSack They call it The Americas because there are more than one. Do schools in the states forget to mention there are seven continents, including North and South America?
GameSack Chazz Princeton approves of this
GameSack The website makes it sound like they arent just going to give them a bunch of packs, and that these guys have to build a deck using only the cards available inside the set.
GameSack All they have to do is stop printing Sacky cards.
GameSack Do u get to keep the cards you pull???
GameSack In a way this is a good thing considering how easy someone can win with certain decks such as E dragons.
GameSack I went to The Lord of the tachyon galaxy and pulled nothing but mecha phantom beasts and other garbage. The strategy I had to use was wait for 3 cards in my deck those were two abyss scale of the mizuchi and abyssocea. So yeah I see how this draft idea sucks.
GameSack They are right, winning through ingenuity doesnt mean anything. Its all about winning with brokedragons and swarms.
GameSack You got in touch with a game dev? Interesting. Anyway, there are plenty of games that are better than the original at least in comparison to the ratio in order media. Take for example Harvest Moon to Harvest Moon 64: Great game to best game in the series.
GameSack Agreed with a lot of people here:Mega Man 1  Mega Man 2Mortal Kombat  Mortal Kombat IITurko 1  Turkok 2Bomberman  Super Bomberman
GameSack I think Link to the Past did a marginally better job than Zelda 2....
GameSack Great episode guys as always! For the longest time I didnt want to believe it, but Donkey Kong Country vs. Donkey Kong Country.
GameSack wheres kingdom hearts 2????????????????????????????????????
GameSack OMFG DAT PHANTASY STAR 4
GameSack I have one: Majoras Mask is a superior followup to Ocarina of Time.
GameSack Just a small error. In Castlevania Adventure and Belmonts Revenge you play as Christopher Belmont, not Simon Belmont.
GameSack Wow been trying to figure out the name to Pilotwings for the longest...
GameSack Earthbound(Mother 2) is a much better and easier game than the first. As good as Mother was, it sadly didnt make it over here to the States officially and is a very hard game unless you grind a lot.
GameSack twisted metal!! the original was alright twisted metal 2 is one of the greatest games ever
GameSack Oddworld Abes Oddysee was a great game, one of my favorite of all time. but Oddworld Abes Exoddus was the superior game by far. with added gameplay mechanics and an improved save system the sequel took everything we loved from the first and made it a hundred times better... however the same cannot be said for every installment released since. and with a new game on the horizon i can hardly wait to play the HD remake of the first game, renamed as New n Tasty!
GameSack 22:10 yup I know what that game was based off of. Wasnt it Skyrim.Jk
GameSack Punchout was a great game, but I think super punchout for snes was a much better sequel.
GameSack Kratose, man I hate that whiny shit stain!Well, I dont know about other people but I dont like QTE because it annihilates your immersion in the game. When Im playing a game, the square button doesnt exist. When I want to jump I dont think oh, I have to press the square button now I think jump!. Then this prompt comes up and Im like shit, wheres squair again?! Oh, right.... its Jump! But then Ive missed the prompt, and you dead, or you keep fighting. Oh, and if its differant each time, its even worse. Then there is the fact that it is playing the same cut scene, over and over again, that you cant even watch. Because you have to constraint on watching for the button presses. It has NOTHING to do with it only a few button presses.Personally, I liked Pilot Wings 1 a lot better than PW64. That might be because of Nostalgia though.
GameSack GOD OF WAR!!!!!! YYEEEESSSSS!!!!
GameSack hey the miamoto in that picture was wearing a sega saturn shirt
GameSack Terranigma. Seriously, Soul Blazer and Illusion of Gaia are blown away by the third in this line...shame it was never released in the US.
GameSack Depresses the hell out of me that I still dont own one of those beautiful machines : Never seen one in a local store around my area ever.....ever.....criminalAlso I would like a Judge Judy game ala Phoenix Wright lol
GameSack Reuploadedi saw that before...
GameSack Lol. I knew this had to be a joke when the video was less than three minutes long.Good video, Joe.
GameSack The console has kinda dumb hardware, why do you gotta use sprites for backgrounds?
GameSack So you suck at gaming, the point is clear, not very funny though..
GameSack Monday upload? Only a 2 minute video? Wtf is going on here?BTW joe has a pretty decent job. SNK vs Capcom AES is worth about 300.
GameSack lol.. Who holds a joystick like that? XD
GameSack 0:36 DUDE! You touched the label with your fingers! (yes I am one of those who take the Neo Geo very seriously). lol, but its true you should never do that
GameSack wait did you unibios the neogeo
GameSack Thats the Classic Gamesack Sounds that i wanna hear :)Joe the Editing in this Clip is awesome.
GameSack Your hands are a little bit ugly.
GameSack Mooaree!!! of this plz...
GameSack Saw the video, tried all that stuff on my 2 slot MVS machine... guess it only works for the AES.
GameSack diddnt really care for magician lord. My personal favorite was Sengoku. The most ate up trippy video game ever made.
GameSack You really need to do an episode on the neo guys! I have been waiting for it,! Nice taster though :D
GameSack Such a versatile console! lol
GameSack Im impressed with how crisps you get the image quality from that Neo Geo.
GameSack Yeah...NEO GEO at its best! Great generation!
GameSack Not sure if Google shares videos automatically or not. If not, then here is the latest episode. I dont see it being automatically posted on the page but then again I dont know what Im doing when it comes to Google  :)
GameSack New Super Mario Bros. 2 is pretty disappointing for me, it just feels like a rehash of NSMBWii with some new levels.
GameSack Diggin that BowserRage Against The Machine crossover shirt.
GameSack Why no spin tricks during excite truck?
GameSack Jazz Jackrabbit might be one. First game was perfect, but second... Well, technically it was good, had better graphics, level editor and multiplayer... But something was off. All fun was taken out, 3D bonus levels, boss fights werent so entertaining and that title rap track... Oh god, I hated it  JJ1 title music is so much better.
GameSack Slow tedious scavenger hunt VS good platforming I dont get it Dav the 2nd one is clearly better. Sparkster is so disappointing its worth way more money then the first, WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN! I wanna play this game dammit.
GameSack Well, if you count gameboy Zelda games as their own thing, Id say Oracle of Seasons, but thats just me.
GameSack I recommend Blaster Master Overdrive on wiiware. Love the show Guys!
GameSack like if you hate the new google comment update
GameSack ExciteTruck good? ExciteBots not fun? Should have swallowed his Gamer Card, Joe. )
GameSack Its not called a ripoff if you take something from the same game (series) on another system.
GameSack Hexen II deserves an honorary mention, even though you dont really cover PC games here. The original took the Doom engine and turned it into something even more amazing with hubbased levels, event scripting, rotating doors, and multiple player classes. The Quakeengined sequel followed up with jerky controls, halfassed levels, sadistic difficulty and recycled MIDI music (in 1997).
GameSack Never even heard of this channel but these videos are really good, informative and humorous I love channels that introduce me to new games and almost every video I have seen so far has done so in spades
GameSack I hate to spam like this, but Im a new channel and would love it if you could check out my latest video. Thanks! http:youtu.beWsKymmc7o84
GameSack Wax that China li in the windows in el viento?
GameSack Return of Strider. Also known as Oh God, Why?
GameSack Guys, I liked your mention of Excite Trucks. I bought a launchday Wii and out of all the games, Excite Trucks is far and away the game I play the most on my Wii, period (although Smooth Moves! is a close second). Its just so goofy fun. I learned about Excite Bots and was planning on getting it this week thanks for saving me from disappointment! Speaking off Wii, I would say the Wii use is a disappointing followup console! Even Nintendo is slackin with solid firstparty releases for the thing!
GameSack Rayman raving rabbids
GameSack ha game, I am disappoint
GameSack Streets of Rage 2 was a vast improvement over the first but the 3rd game in the series took a step back. At least in the PAL region. Changing the characters clothing colours and the difficulty was set much higher than NTSC and JPN version of the game.
GameSack Maybe everyone already knows this but Excite Truck is actually a sort of follow up to Excite Bike on the NES. I heard that somewhere but I cant remember where.
GameSack I thought for sure Strider Returns would have made the list.

GameSack Sonic 1 and 2 remastered for iOS and android.
GameSack Controls in flash back were much better on the Amiga, I use to criticize the controls on most of the games on that machine because one button for everyting is what I consider to be a big fail, but in the case of games like Another World or Flashback, it is an advantage (in Flashback on the Amiga you press the spacebar key to use the gun).
GameSack I really like joe but he looks about as smart as a cave man but I love there episodes no offense dude your still a kick ass dude and I would love to grab beers with you two anytime
GameSack But its The Legend Begins not The Journey Begins O.O
GameSack When you have a 12 hour work day just sitting behind a computer. A lot of Gamesacking is going down. Thanks guys!
GameSack Nintendo do an update for the 30th anniversary :)
GameSack You forgot about the super Mario advance series. That was the best version of Mario all stars!!!
GameSack Literally, this is the first time Ive heard ANYBODY recommend the Flashback Remake. .
GameSack No love for Klonoa?Why...
GameSack Suggestions for if you do another one of these: Phantasy Star Generation 1 (English translation available online now for play via Playstation emulator), Bionic Commando ReArmed (PS3X360PC), Monkey Island Special Edition Collection (PS3X360PC), PunchOut!! (Wii), Final Fantasy III (NDS), Tomb Raider: Anniversary (Wii), and Ys III Eternal (NDS)
GameSack tmnt reshelled was garbage
GameSack hey what bout megaman x and megaman maverick hunter x?
GameSack Maybe Nintendo will do better on the 30th anniversary edition of Super Mario Brothers... I really hope so...
GameSack What a great channel, Came here with recommendation from Happy Console Gamer, glad I did, going to have a great time looking back through your old videos
GameSack Dragon Force remake would be awesome
GameSack rocket knight adventures
GameSack guys, I loved the cloud master vid, i never knew there was a wii version,now I will get one just to play it,thanks
GameSack A reason there are no black borders is because the tv wont autoadjust to a stretched wide screen.
GameSack Compare Resident Evil 1, 2, and 3 to their many remakes. said The Playstation guy...
GameSack As much as I liked Zero Mission, I felt the stealth mission at the end was completely added on just to boost the length of the game. And it didnt really add much of anything in my experience.
GameSack Mit Sprachen hast dus nicht so, ne? Oder wie sonst erklrst du den flieenden bergang von der spanischen Ansage ins franzsische Kauderwelsch :D Eure Gegner hatten wirklich gute Reparatsen an Bord. Aber das stndige Rammen htte nun wirklich nicht sein mssen. Macht doch irgendwann keinen Spa mehr...
GameSack Genau, die Aufnahme kam direkt danach. Sind aber zum Glck nur zwei Folgen ) Aber so etwas muss man als Chance begreifen... Vielleicht kann daraus ja etwas lustiges entstehen )
GameSack Die stiftest du auch so :P
GameSack No one is blocking(screen pass?)
GameSack I met someone online that tried this with me. They got me the first few times, but then I ate them alive with screens and quick passes.
GameSack Haha! When the offense is running a screen it doesnt take much to get to the qb
GameSack Hey, Dave  Joe, I ran a good search to see which version of D is best(because Im thinking of trying it out), and I read a comment from someone who said that D is an awful game, but that D2(yes, there is yet another game in the series) is actually a good game, so you might want to try that one out. It was released exclusively for the Dreamcast.
GameSack Another superb episode guys. One question though which of you owns the black cat in the intro?
GameSack king of demons is an awesome game just like gs mikami i didnt think anybody knew of the games but me ah i guess thats a little selfish sounding
GameSack I used to have ghost house on cartridge, i loved it! hunting vampires was so fun :D
GameSack Great episode guys!!! I wanted to look that Super Famicom game you showcased. What was it called again ?
GameSack Joe, I for one would really appreciate it if Enemy Zero was featured in an episode. I beat that game once in normal mode back in 99. It was a hybrid FMVFPS, but in some ways it was an antiFPS in that you couldnt blast willy nilly, you had 13 shots that you had to charge against an invisible enemy. I have played games less frustrating, but never a game that confounded expectations as much Also Why no D2? Maybe a Kenji Eno episode?
GameSack I thought Id mention to you... when I was in third grade, I went as Beetlejuice for Halloweener, the cartoon version (with the red shirt inside), rather than the movie one (white shirt inside).

GameSack great games recommended here! awesome video as usual!
GameSack I use Game Collector 5.2 Pro. Great program. :)
GameSack That end movie was terrifying.
GameSack Because! The end parts are shot normally (and with a different camera) to show a difference between the two states of Dave.
GameSack I remember seeing D in magazines. Looked so cool.
GameSack Thats right, my bad, the Marty even though it looked like a game console it was more of a computer system, it even had a floppy drive and was backwardcompatible with FM Towns.
GameSack Did you guys film that with Dave walking backwards? The SUV door and the wood as well as the way Dave was walking looked a little funny looking.
GameSack Thanks for noticing! :)
GameSack Thank you for a great episode :)
GameSack Amazing video. Ive been watching you guys since the start and it seems like the quality is getting better every video!
GameSack Nice movie. You guys could really pull of a remake of Peter Gabriels Sledgehammer! :)
GameSack You guys really like stop motion...
GameSack Whats scary is that Dave rides dirty!
GameSack Jill! I mean...Joe! Dont  open...that door!
GameSack Nice really like the old silent era style. Dave magically hovering up the stairs at the end was pretty good to along with the carpet roll up.
GameSack awesome... joe, your basement sure has come a long way. How long ago was this filmed?
GameSack Joe have you played any of the pikmin games? Im playing pikmin 3 right now...totally underrated series in the US i think,
GameSack next time ill just read the description...
GameSack New(ish) stuff from Game Sack and its not even Sunday... feels more like Christmas than Halloween! :)
GameSack Dave forgot to wipe and wash his hands! I remember this from a year ago when people complained. Great skit!
GameSack This was done in 2001? He doesnt look like he aged at all since then.
GameSack I dont own one now, traded it in for a Panasonic 3DO years ago. I love my still fully working 3DO but miss my 32X and keep intending to repurchase one. I can definitely recommend it, especially for classic arcade games like Virtua RacerFighter, Kolibri and totally arcade perfect Space Harrier and After Burner. It had more good games than people think. In an interesting note I own a slightly suspicious version of DarXide on Nokias Ngage QD. A perfect conversion, and yes, I did originally own the 32X version and never had a problem beating the first level. I guess you just suck! Lol!!
GameSack I just want to say thank you and that I appreciate this review. When I saw the title, I didnt actually expect you guys to literally cover all the games for this system.
GameSack lol  the Fifa comments. Its still that way today
GameSack Nice vid guys!! Good times, I only got the 32x a few years ago and I love it for its qwerkiness lol, check out my channel if you get the chance, Ive made a few vids about my trials and tribulations with the nightmare that is the 32x
GameSack Master system  System 16 Genesis  System 3232x  Model 1Saturn  Model 2 and Model 3Dreamcast  Naomi
GameSack I love your show! Thanks for making such great videos!
GameSack So the best Sega could muster was a 150 equivalent of the sfx chip? What a piece of trash.
GameSack A decent port of Daytona USA on the 32x wouldve had me sold.
GameSack Long live Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf.
GameSack Nothing makes the virtual boy look good except some excedrin and the off switch.
GameSack 32x looks awesome :) i wish i could get one :(
GameSack 7:20 Virtua Racing Deluxe
GameSack Knuckles Chaotix and Tempo make this system worth it for me. Will be buying as soon as possible.
GameSack the Space Harrier remains me 3d Wolrd Runner for the Nes! XD
GameSack 31:15 I have one of those PCs
GameSack Forget Doom, its all about Wolfenstein!
GameSack I want Daves shirt. Star Trek: Starfleet Academy is fn awesome.
GameSack I had 3 of these pieces of shit when it came out. By the time g
GameSack I never heard of the 32 X still this video.
GameSack Ah SEGA my FavouriTe c0mPANY of the GAMES!
GameSack Is the sega fanboy related to budo jake?
GameSack Huh...thought they released a looney tunes game about taz on the 32.
GameSack I just say Angry Video Game Nerd, all the way )(He got so popular.. his work is everywhere :D)
GameSack Thats another way of doing what I suggested a while back X3
GameSack Ah a good dose of Kakujo and Narun. Always nice.
GameSack the mark of kri was an awesome game
GameSack yep, crash racing for the ps2 was meh compared to the great crash racing for the ps1.....
GameSack They did an amazing job with the graphics on Ristar. For the Genesis having a limited color pallet, the game gives you the illusion that the Genesis has a color pallet comparable to the SNES and the PC Engine unless with later Genesis games they put extra chips in the cartridges to give the games more colors. I dont know but later Genesis games look awesome.
GameSack If I had to say one of my personal favorite games time forgot, Id say Segas Virtual ON series. Its a series of high speed, Japanese 3D mech fighting games with some of the best music youll ever hear (especially when you play the Dreamcast version) But word of advice: Stay FAR AWAY from Virtual On Marz on PS2. (unless you live in Japan  The localization team absolutely BUTCHERED the American version, screwing with the enemy AI, and even removing whole game features, namely the highly requested Database mode.)
GameSack Ristar is one of my ALLTIME FAVOURITES!!! The fact that they never released a sequel is a sin! I always imagined a tiein with Sonic of some sort.
GameSack This is the loudest ive laughed at the post credits scene. Fantastic! Epic timing and Daves face is priceless
GameSack Uniracers got a lot of play from me back in the day. I thought it was pretty neat. Also, the bike in Stunt Race FX is where the speed is at.
GameSack I wouldve liked Chakan to do something like that. It couldve been cool, like a competitor to Castlevania. Pulseman should also do that. Pulseman is amazing.
GameSack HEY! BACK OFF NOCTURNUS IN THE NIGHT! I LIKE THAT VERSION MORE THAN SYMPHONY OF THE NIGHT!
GameSack Perfect Dark for N64 needs a sequel.
GameSack I read somewhere Ristar was originally going to be a Sonic game.. Any truth in this..?
GameSack I really really like CTR.
GameSack I was very surprised to see Crash Team Racing here on this list, it got rave reviews, it got great sales and people still love it today. And it actually did get a sequel Crash Nitro Cart (although it wasnt made by Naughty Dog). It definitely should not be on a forgotten games list
GameSack Hey bro, the colors of the track in Uniracers let you know what is coming up next, be it a jump, hazard, open track, etc. That game is awesome and you are lazy.
GameSack I love Crash Team Racing! Me and my mom would play it all the time when I was a kid. I actually prefer it over Mario Kart to be honest.
GameSack I will never forget CTR!
GameSack I miss maximo I think thats how its spelled lol
GameSack 1:29 ....is that a penis ship?
GameSack LOL  1:30.... Its pretty deep in that hole.
GameSack Where the heck do you guys get all your awesome shirts? Are they custom made?
GameSack Woo, Mark of Kri was one of my favorite ps2 games.
GameSack Mark of Kri was an awesome game.
GameSack Actually nintendos first arcade game that went to america was a space shooter
GameSack Call me crazy but Cyborg Justice and Tobal 2 should have gotten more play.
GameSack Xexyz, Captain Skyhawk, Kid Chameleon, and Jackie Chans Action Kung Fu were all great games that needed more love. Id put music from JCAKF on mega man level of awesome.
GameSack Tak and the power of juju
GameSack Mercenary on the C64.
GameSack what is that song during the credits?
GameSack dude your audio quality (commentary wise voice) is so much better and clearer, bit further away from your mouth and it will be perfection! Alternatively loving the Skyrim serious dude, keep up the great work, also nearly 900 subs!
GameSack Hi Friends,Enjoy the pictorial illustration of History and lore of Game of thrones, and this is about The Sack Of Kings Landing in House Lannister Perspective
GameSack Ahaha...yall a fool fa this
GameSack Lol loved this play he is beast and should be acknowledged more .. go Broncos!
GameSack I cant stop viewing the replay. The sack was so good.
GameSack I love pot roast!!! 94
GameSack nice, just right click the video and go to properties and click disable resample. it wont look so choppy

GameSack I love your videos that make my day
GameSack Lewis can u plz do splinter cell blacklist multiplayer
GameSack Lewis can you friend me
GameSack Wow, what an awesome game full of explosions! And the best part is, Its on my Bday :D
GameSack Andys right on the money.Cardiff are so lucky to have Solskjaer. Theyll probably end up finishing higher than United....
GameSack cant stand by your own manager for half a season... pathetic
GameSack The best players dont like playing for Moyes, The worst players like playing for Moyes..How the fuck has Clev got a start every sodding game? Jeez.
GameSack Sack the shite out of Moyes! Sam Allardyce is the man!
GameSack giggs aint got his badges yet lad. lol
GameSack Give it to Giggsy till the end of the season. Possibly the worst suggestion I have heard all season. I hate people who boo, what good does booing do lmao if we could sing as loud as we boo maybe the players would waken up during the match. As much as I wanted him to succeed, its Moyes out for me but I wont stop supporting the team I love.
GameSack If you want Moyes to go, go support Chelsea or City, you cant want him gone when hes only been here about 6 months. Hes playing the same players that won the league last season, so why is Moyes to blame for the players not playing to their best? It took fergie 6 years to win a trophy. Give Moyes time!!
GameSack I blame the players not the managers theres no creativity. They have talent but no belief in themselves.
GameSack Lets keep the faith, were not Aston Villa yet, we dont sack managers and besides what could Sir Ryan of Giggs do? Bulb the canteen lady?
GameSack Its not just about Moyes. The team is just not good enough. Let Moyes sign some players so he can get his own team, not Fergies team. Every new manager wants his own players. Moyes is not an magician like Ferguson. Let the man build his own team, then the results will come. What Fergie did with this team was excellent. I gotta say. Im not an United fan, but what Fergie got out of the players was impressive.. Because, its not very impressive any more. Ferdinand is over the top. RvP is back with his usual injuries (Arsenal history), Rooney is great and he is the teams nr.1 at the moment. Carrick is good. Rafael is getting better. But on the other side of the defense you have Evra thats aging and getting bader and bader. This United team needs 2 or 3 new world class players that can go straight into the first team. A boxtobox mdifielder, attacker, and Central defender.
GameSack moyes changed backroom staff that were loved by the players and brings in phil neville!? that is a fuck up of impressive magnitude....souness did same thing at pool in 90s... it fucked them up for 20 odd years
GameSack Moyes needs a chance at least until the end of the season. Where we end up by then is yet to be seen but he wont last long if this continues. Would be amazing to see a united legend take over though like Solskjaer or Cantona etc.
GameSack FFS we won the BPL less than 12 months ago and have been arguably the most successful team in world football for the last 1015 years. Every team has these phases and we r no different. Ours has just come after years and years of incredible success. SAF is one of the best managers to walk the earth and Moyes should have no pressure to b the next Alex Ferguson. We have been spoiled for a long time and need to stick by and support moyes as well as the entire team. Anyone who wants moyes sacked can go and support Cardiff
GameSack As a united fan from India who started supporting them after they were certain to win the bpl, I think either Moyes should stay so we keep losing or we get AVB a manager who knows what he is doing and spends money wisely especially Lamela (moyes should have smapped him up for manu). Im losing hope in moyes and this shit new united squad. I am considering changing to Arsenal, City or Chelsea to support depending on who wins da prem! AVBINMOYESOUT 20CHAMPIONS MANU4EVARRR GGMU GLORYHUNTER MOYES YOUTUBE BANTER TEAMINDIA INDIALOVESMANUANDFERGIE
GameSack The manager we should of got is now at Everton!
GameSack I just realized it will be 10x as bad in the media if we get knocked out of the league cup too. With no signings in January... Moyes is about to age 10 years in 6 months...
GameSack Spot on, well said Andy
GameSack i was there for atleast 30 mins
GameSack hey almightyapeman I played the lottery had to pic 6 s the jackpot was worth 656 million I hit 3 out of the 6 s if I would of just got the other 3 right I would be a millionaire tonight well the lottery story is true that really happened a few yrs ago when I played the mega millions the 656mill jackpot is still the largest jackpot in history I almost had a piece of the pie but my point is I didnt win an I didnt sit around an say oh if I would of just picked those other 3 s blah blah if I would of waited a tad bit longer maybe that would of changed things ect ect no I realized I didnt win the lottery so all that talk SEC is overstated if GA would of had better clock management they would of beat BAMA blah blah is old worn out garbage talk the SEC has won 7 straight still looking to win 8 straight then you wanna come around an say they are overrated? you dont accomplish that many victorys by luck son every last one of them was EARNED even if another conference won this season they still got a long ways to go before catching up to the SEC we are so far ahead of everyone else till it aint even funny I suggest you quit your crying an give credit where credit is due ROLL TIDE
GameSack Thats reminds me of the Sack Game against Auburn in 2005
GameSack Nick Marshall will be doing the same thing after the Iron Bowl. Auburn doesnt realize that Bama has the best rushing defense in the NATION, and the run will do absolutely nothing against them. Bama wins the Iron Bowl, and wins the NC.RTR
GameSack This game we played different from any other game weve ever played. imo the best game in the second half ever under nick saban. sad to see mettenburger sacked 4xs but the tide was coming in and nothing gets in its way. Roll Tide Roll 2013 Nat. Champs!!!
GameSack I didnt realize an offensive line could be this...offensive... damn
GameSack Mettenberger was a drama queen. Anyone else notice him trotting off after the clock ran out? It looked like the Oline was punishing him. He better gain their respect again lmao
GameSack He just ignores his own lineman trying to help him. Mad respect for that
GameSack He looks like a wounded animal.
GameSack Ive been looking for this great quality video. Thanks for posting.
GameSack Les Miles is slowly losing his mojo at LSU. Maybe a move to Texas or USC would do some good. He is weird, but I dont think he is an awful coach.
GameSack Gonna be funny when Bama loses to Auburn.
GameSack As an Alabama student, our sack chantsong, the one you hear in the background is by far my favorite thing we do. More than Sweet Home Alabama and Dixieland Delight. I get chills hearing the entire stadium screaming YOU! after that short bit of music.
GameSack LOL Mett throwing his helmet.you just got PROCESSED
GameSack Thanks for uploading this. Had been hunting it since the game ended.
GameSack Love the coaches reactions after the sack!! AUsome!! WDE!!!!
GameSack That game made Ace Atkins a household name for a while. WAR EAGLE
GameSack Great call Rod Bramblett and Stan White. Stan is pumped! Great win against a great team. War Eagle
GameSack Better than 2010? Better than 2827? Better than HeisCam? Not possible.
GameSack Rods call on this is great. Thanks for uploading this!
GameSack Id really like to hear Dave Souths call of this
GameSack Yeah hes not gonna get anywhere near Winston on Monday night.
GameSack Appreciate your interest and dedication. I worked long and hard on this name. I hope to get much fame from the hard work I took into making up this completely great name. You think theyll name something after me?
GameSack Thumbs up for the dance. Thumbs down for your attention whorish need to name it. And a silly ass name at that.
GameSack Itd probably be best if you didnt comment...
GameSack oh,,it would have been cooler the other way
GameSack Copy cat staff, they dont have a single creative idea and blindly copy all her ideas. This company obviously lack of talent and the boss sucks like hell
GameSack FUCk USC.. Love, Die hard Cal fan
