TopGear Thats my car right there! Oo
TopGear THIS IS THE CAR OF MY DREAMSSSSSSSSS
TopGear The feeling when the engine goes WOOOOOHM WOOOOOOHM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! please someone notify me when the car is 100 euros in the distant future so I can buy it :D
TopGear Im in love whith this car
TopGear but is it road legal?
TopGear Batmobile )I is the 6 th element!!!
TopGear they need to make Clarkson do reviews like these again
TopGear ME WANT: shoves money at screen
TopGear Clarksons carboat would have won it easily, if it was driven by somebody other than Clarkson himself..
TopGear Is that your car?Yes?Its the wrong way up...Dont give me technicalitiesThe much loved Clarkson vs May event banter, and possibly one of their best and funniest unscripted segments. Thankyou Top Gear.
TopGear I hope the guys still keep the show going on because I want to see more of them do more funny stunts and try new cars
TopGear please, does anybody know the name of the composition playing from the beginning? you can hear it as james dives in the water around 00:12
TopGear I still see this on Dave all the time, love it
TopGear This episode was on Dave earlier today
TopGear I love the fact that the 225hp engine was almost nomnomnomnoming Jeremy lol :P
TopGear Only 5 years too late?
TopGear cool emotional report
TopGear I had a Pantene Hair Collection ad before watching this by Youtube... hommage to James hair?
TopGear The Singer 911 shows how amazing the us can still engineer
TopGear no offense but first thing that came to mind as porshe has always been my dream car i thought lucky bastard get to drive more than one porshe in a day would be a blast good video loved it
TopGear Check out Captain Slow drifting away!!
TopGear A love letter to a car...
TopGear Too bad the first one built was sold by the owner only six months after he got it....he wanted it to be the first...and didnt care about what went in to it....shame on you.....
TopGear And I send it all my kisses...........
TopGear So beautiful video :,)
TopGear Pfft ... Hold my beer.
TopGear brings back memories of going to the very first US D1 event at Irwindale Speedway.where does the time go?
TopGear its a Aussie holden repackage all over the place gto in usa and vauxhall where ever they sell that
TopGear So the Vauxhall Monaro is pretty much the Pontiac GTO of a few years ago? Looks like the same car. Glad to see the GTO is still alive and well as a Vauxhaull now that Pontiac is gone.
TopGear Watching this all I can see is....GTO lol
TopGear why the front side of 240sx is replaced by 1 from silvia?
TopGear I need these guys to come to finland, and battle off with our drifters! Japan will always be number 1 thou xD Id just want to see these guys here! :D
TopGear My mans had a boner at 6:14 lol
TopGear great vid, great car, great end song!!!
TopGear Wish they wouldve went into detail about the motor, wish i wouldve never sold my banshee
TopGear That must be one fun lawn mower to drive!
TopGear Ah put a 350 in one then through wheelie bars on it and call it done.
TopGear LIKE A NINTENDO MARIO CART !!! GREAT !!!
TopGear It has to be a fully functioning lawn mower to qualify for the record. So I would think beast is totally capable of cutting your Dads lawn in 30 seconds flat lol
TopGear Can he come cut my grass?
TopGear Not so much civics but more so NSXs and S2000s. Oh youre right though. Just terrible cars. In response to another post, it does have a working blade. It is driven by I believe two electric motors rather than a normal setup driven by the engine. It has to be able to work as a mower to meet the Guinness criteria.
TopGear 85 mph and yet its a lawnmower. thats going to lawn your grass in seconds!
TopGear This is crazy!! and im not a Mc Laren fan! Im a massive Ferrari fan instead. But this car is really something different! its a weapon! Cant wait to see compared to LaFerrari
TopGear was surprised when I saw top gear track in the title
TopGear Will we get to know the lap time and will you release the POV vid this week?
TopGear i was so happy when the music stopped so we could listen to the symphony this machine produces. what an insane car!!
TopGear Love the car, do you like it more than the Aventador? Thanks for the video DoctaM3.
TopGear grande sei unico che si impegna veramente
TopGear LMAO during the Pincer Movement.
TopGear YouTube TopGear videos in HD!? I never thought Id live to see the day.
TopGear 3:54 The Pincer Movement moment LOL!
TopGear Im going to go back up. Thats my kind of thinking. Thanks guys.
TopGear lloll kill engine hover van hihihi
TopGear Wheres the reat of the episode
TopGear Perhaps that rear and center differential would benefit from a downshift  weightshift into the corner to kick out the rear wheels rather than locking up the rear wheels with the emergency brake. Not so great on your street designed AWD car.
TopGear Well that was dumb. If I wanted to see the specs typed out on screen I would search it on google. I clicked on this to watch a video.
TopGear the most overpriced car eva Drag Race: 2012 Lexus LFA vs 2010 Nissan GTRthe only thing it does well is sound good
TopGear Take a look at this video on YouTube:
TopGear wonderfuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuul
TopGear Absolutely love this car!
TopGear If Lexus would just utilize the exact same engine with a hybrid electric motor and a new double clutch transmission, the results would be intense
TopGear My favourite car to come out of Japan  the NSX is a legend  so was the driver that made it famous
TopGear Beautiful car. The only flaw...they dont make it in manual transmission! There seems to be an effeminate trend going on where all car manufacturers are making their sportier cars paddle shifting. I dont understand it but if I was going to spend that type of money I would want to drive my car and not just ride in it.
TopGear 1:46 Someone tried to kill Hammond O.o
TopGear its a shame the original murcielago hasnt aged well at all :(
TopGear did I just heard only idiots take parts.??haha! funny then..
TopGear My most favourite car,more than a Bugatti and a koenigsegg. It has a extremely aggressive look, but with subtle lines, not harsh curves, so at the same time it gets the same feeing as an Aston Martin.
TopGear This thing still stops everyone when it screams by and always will!
TopGear Was hoping he would chase people with that XD
TopGear Bahaha! That guy pulled Hammond in front to protect himself from the bull..!
TopGear I remember when this came out... it was years ago.
TopGear Puoi mettere anche le stagioni vecchie come la 567 che fanno crepare dalle risate? :D
TopGear Kopfhrer aufm helm xD
TopGear Why would a multimillion dollar broadcasting program like BBC need a shitty freemium game that sucks the money out of your wallet?
TopGear Another Temple Run clone?
TopGear Unity game engine?Nice
TopGear Jajaj great, i want this game too
TopGear At least I know he is a male, not a female.
TopGear What a nice advert for the game lol
TopGear Complimenti per il lavoro che stai facendo
TopGear Looks to be a computer game
TopGear the speed machines will live on! :)
TopGear I am a serious racing car, Englisher!! Dont drive with your clown shoes on!! gotta love his German accent on that one XD
TopGear Turn up the volume on your TV, and listen to this... silenceROFL
TopGear Amazing the future electric car
TopGear One just does not buy a Black Series, he orders one and wait until it is crafted for him. Then he can release its wrath.
TopGear 5:47 When it feels like you have engine braking, you do... :) Electric motors brake the car meanwhile generate electricity.7:21 Its irrelevant with a supercar. Buying one is a titanic waste in the first place.
TopGear Mercedes  Perfection!!
TopGear I would never buy an electric car no matter how fast it is! They have no soul, great noise or anything, they are disgusting! The same goes for those filthy crossbread hybrids as well!!!
TopGear Did anyone see that the license plate says SLS
TopGear Great to see that youre back...Thanks for the effort and hope to see more coming.
TopGear Top Gear 20x05 ITA HD Prima Parte
TopGear Sei un mito ma dove lo vedi te ? la seconda parte quando arriva
TopGear Hood? Whats a hood?... :P
TopGear The Stig at the end..killed it :))))))
TopGear somebody please buy me one :)
TopGear Under the hood?Glasgow?You didnt drive that car round Pollockshields did you?
TopGear You guys are missing the point. Sure its an Aston and they are supposed to go fast. But leave the audacious BHP and 0to60 Times to other auto makers. Its about style and everyday driving comfort. Its how you get to your destination not how fast. Thats the name of the game in this beaut. Its refined from inside out. You know its an Aston prob bc you can hear that sexy exhaust note from a mile away. Yet the driver is tucked away nicely in the comfort and quiet cockpit. Dont compare GTR Corvette or even a 911 GT3. Completely different cars. Top gear has it dead on. Stigy. Btw when was the last time any of you drove a 4 sec car? We look at these numbers and stack them up to other cars without even experiencing them for ourselves. If the Aston has a v12 that has 517 or 565 bla bla bla so be it. Still faster than you will ever need.
TopGear Steering wheel looks outdated
TopGear Top Gear 20x03 ITA HD Seconda Parte
TopGear Maybe not quite fair to compare the Exige to one of the worst drivers car on the planet Stig or no
TopGear 4:22 the stig on the stang?
TopGear Shelby GT500 vs. Lotus Exige
TopGear The only American cars that would have had a fighting chance is the Ford gt or a late model corvette. Mustangs can be very fast in a straight line but that live axle kills their handling
TopGear The should have put a Ford Mustang Cobra against the Lotus. British engineering the Lotus is not. The car is a put together. The Mustang is from the ground up engineered in America. Jeremy is too biased.
TopGear Detroit, Mitchigan. lol
TopGear So the lotus weighs how much and has only 50 hp less, hardly a contest, another120hp on the Mustang and things would be equal. The lotus weighs almost 900 lbsless ( 4 Jeremy Clarks) try that out.
TopGear German, Italy, England, Japan...
TopGear Sei un mito grandeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :P
TopGear Lubi w Waszych filmach t jako wykonania. To Was wyrnia od innych. PS Co to za muzyka w tle?
TopGear Killing it!Nissan Sonvia running an RB27DET making 600HP.
TopGear Wow!!quando carichi le prossime?
TopGear (reminder of the Africa special) Jeremy: Its always funny when James goes near water cause he always ends up falling in...
TopGear Damn right that Fezza is a little bit more special, but 0:11 ... OMG. That BLUE!! 0.oI know its not really right to have a Ferrari in any other colour than red... or yellow... or black... but one in that blue would make me so dang happy! )
TopGear Assassins creed music in the McLarens lap lol 4:20
TopGear props to bradley cooper XD
TopGear Did anybody else notice that they used Assassins Creed 3 Main Theme while Jeremy was driving around in the McLaren?
TopGear I love this show, its one of my favorites! You guys are so funny, I love the special episode where you guys drove through Africa and went to the Nile. :)
TopGear Even if your not really into cars.. . The bbc Top Gear is a bloody good show to watch.. :))
TopGear Hey thats not Bradley Cooper.
TopGear Circuit De Francis Drake lolol.So funny, i wonder if the Spanish see the funny side of it lol.
TopGear Last laugh is on James, I think. Considering that he loves Ferrari and owns one, he is probably the one who is going to review La Ferrari.(Now the only thing we need is the three of them going up against The Stig andor Sabine Schmidt in one of the best petrolonly cars and see who goes the fastest around the Nordschleife :P)
TopGear Chernobyl was boring. Anthony Bourdain was there long before these chaps.
TopGear i loved chernobyl,,it was very interesting and what i was interested in!
TopGear jeremy needs to drive a hennessey venom gt. thats amazing
TopGear so thats it..?? After the 2nd half of the Burma trip, thats the end of the season? what, 3 or 4 shows..?? I remember the old days when they were 810!!!
TopGear One of the best series theyve produced. Cant wait for that P1 vs 918 race.
TopGear do like the older season, make like 10 ep or so.
TopGear Zero0 automotive accomplishments...almost. .
TopGear Top Gear 19x06 ITA HD Full Video
TopGear Non hai la seconda parte? Ormai sono curioso di sapere come va a finire :)
TopGear nice.. the best tlga ang VictoryLiner :)
TopGear Can I have please have the LFA and the Vantage? Thanks :P
TopGear Shes not smart her fathers are rich, what a pussy was yo get famefame
TopGear Blue Man Group would be really cool to mix into this show, I believe they would fit right in there.
TopGear Shes so adorable and her accent is just so nice to listen to! :)
TopGear Whats the orange car at 1:46?
TopGear is there anyway to add subtitles to this?
TopGear Gosh darn her and her amazing accent, now I need to listen to slow it down a couple hundred more times.
TopGear I suspect theres hundreds of hours of Gran Turismo behind this success. But he still had to drive it for realz ) Spoiler: He beat everyone
TopGear Sounds too artificial for me this man!
TopGear hes liek..sounds..so like high..dewd..ya
TopGear well doesnt he suck at turning the car lol. Constantly pressing the accelerator pedal when turning, its so obvious.
TopGear Shouldnt that say braking?
TopGear Did great, even on the wrong side of the car!
TopGear braking bad is awesome,Aaron Paul is my favourite actor
TopGear I like the new reasonably priced car!
TopGear Top Gear is AWESOME!!!!! The BBC version of course!
TopGear You have to love these guys how do they come up with these races LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear Why James didnt use launch control?
TopGear This airport was made by corruption, its completely abandoned. So it can use like a track and top gear spanish version will be founded )
TopGear Three Englishmen drag racing in supercars...The result being one guy saying hang on a tick chaps lets perform a bit of high speed testing on our roof mechanisms and the other two thinking its a spiffing idea. I think, given a runway and three supercars, most of the world would be happy going really fast and doing donuts or some shit but not three Englishmen.
TopGear Yes BBC version is definitely the best
TopGear at 0:12 james mays nein i dieeeeeeeeed laughing ... xD omg
TopGear Ive been in this 3 cylinder crap and its horrible.
TopGear Sei un grande!!!!!!Fra quanto pensi che riuscirai a mettere la seconda parte?Grazie comunque!!!!
TopGear Sub10club for downloading the app. :P
TopGear Scottie224 Nokia......
TopGear Have you ever raced a Stigcousin against the real thing? Whos faster?
TopGear Due to the unique way the BBC is funded....
TopGear Hahah the headphones on the helmet.. of course! )
TopGear hes not wearing dre beats
TopGear Ce anche per Windows phone :)
TopGear kurcze chop to ma wspania prace znajdzie etat dla mnie?
TopGear Very Good Episode!!!!
TopGear nice erica, i like todays torque shout. keep them coming.
TopGear ONE TO ONE? THE ONE???TO LOGO IS ONE:1IT IS KNOWN AS THE ONE ONE
TopGear How in the hell can you say that the One:1 is ugly!! Dont think there is any awsome Super hyper car then the Koeniggsegg.
TopGear fast and furios is based on need for speed (the game) so why not havin a movie related straight to the game?!but the thing is that vin dieselpaul walker combination was pretty strong! so we have to wait and see the NFS movie, it must have a huge impact so it could go further!! cause we all gonna go and watch it but without the strong first impression were not gonna do it next time...
TopGear any car that can only measure its top speed in only one place in the world is too slow
TopGear QoftheD Im not sure if the NFS movie will become the next fast  furious franchise but Im pumped about it
TopGear Derek D should be a star in a reasonably priced car
TopGear I think Need for Speed the movie is trying to become like FATF but i think they will do something wrong and everyone will hate the move and they will go back to making games :D
TopGear 3:45 w tym wypadku Jtka nie Aaltonen )
TopGear Check out this video on YouTube:
TopGear Another expensive and silly episode thst left tg knobs stupefied and in awe. Wow! Behold, a motor, chassy and some form of coupe. Would you look at that. What a piece of ....
TopGear It almost sounds like a snowmachine.
TopGear THAT sound! OMG, its pornographic!
TopGear point, squirt....lots of noise, opposite lock, repeat!!!!
TopGear James, you could always just buy a wind screen from Caterham...could you not?
TopGear it may be the fastest car on the track if the track is dry
TopGear if michael Schumacher was the stig... whos stigging now?
TopGear I wish this was how the new F1 cars would drive
TopGear the stig is ether a woman or has a hefty set of tits 1.13
TopGear Bellissimo episodio, grazie! Ne hai altri?
TopGear make the driver burns instead of the car.. id call that awesome
TopGear Look at that Subaru acting like a GT3. (Hope this comment wont chatch fire)
TopGear Nice slow mo fire but Subaru abuse is a crime against nature!
TopGear Perhaps he should tune his STI...I think its running a little rich at full throttle judging from the back seat fire.
TopGear I would rather watch my own videos than pay to see this live.
TopGear topgear u spelled roland different in the video title and different in the video y?
TopGear I was there in Topgear live in the Netherlands. Amazing show!
TopGear Chuckle Brothers with carstricks? .. The live show is a little too circus based for me. I love a good circus, but not a circus that is genuinely trying to be serious, intelligent or classy.
TopGear Am I the only one who thinks Nick is hotter than James Blunt?.. :D
TopGear 1:25 Looks like he is trying to record a fart :D
TopGear Its raining Againsupertramp 3
TopGear 1:15  I know it was wet the last time you came,... thats what she said
TopGear fajny materia, pozdrawiam:)
TopGear Spanish sounds like Argentinian and Spaniard! LOL!
TopGear Greetings from Mxico. Spanish dubbing is rubbish.
TopGear You didnt hear Estonian.. because we like see and hear the real thing ! So no stupid voiceovers, only a simple subs on the bottom! xD so cheers English language! xD
TopGear Actually I thought a little bit more about it and I think Jeremy Clarkson should be dubbed over with car sounds, and James May should be dubbed over with farm animals.
TopGear Voiceover is the indicator that a country is stupid and can not read subtitles!
TopGear So far Ive watched it in french and watched Top Gear USA. Top Gear UK is still the Best.
TopGear I meant Dubai is a city in UAE
TopGear in the Netherlands they just use subtitles
TopGear is this car faster then the Atom 500?
TopGear When can I try it in France?!!
TopGear You dont need one. But you need one because it is such a lovely thing. Well told
TopGear I will get the Atom first
TopGear A drag race between the ariel and the mono would be nice to watch
TopGear Hah Im watching on an iPad
TopGear the ultimate track toy, but if you do the math, it has a power to weight ratio 2 times lower than the Agera one:1. i think that with the mono you get much more than what you pay, considering the price of the agera one:1 and considering that the mono is not much slower on a track
TopGear They should testdrive the new Radical RCX Turbo coming out soon :D That would be awesome :D
TopGear Hammond in Spanish PRICELESS xD
TopGear hahahaha omg the spanish version
TopGear Spanish Hammond.Just... yes.
TopGear Only heard it once in Turkish and i can say it feels very strange to hear them in another voice. Original is the best.
TopGear Italian 3english still the best
TopGear I am German but I never watch this in my own language, I like the original English version.By the way, Hammond in Spanish is best.
TopGear spanish sounds like crazy frog
TopGear I couldnt stand watching top gear in non english
TopGear i like the englich and the german languages
TopGear Who needs dubbing when all you need is subtitles
TopGear German! But the BEST ones are the originals, the latest on the Top Gear Chanel on Streetfire!
TopGear hammond in spanish HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!
TopGear That is the most beautiful car Ive ever seen. Coming in just above that Aston DBsomething that James May drove in the race to the Mexican border. Its like a robot and a foodmixer had a baby.
TopGear Im watching this on an iPad
TopGear Why wont you jus put on the kind of helmet that the stig has?
TopGear Actually... Its the combination of Gforce and air causing it. You know G  mg  F  ma  G  ma. In this example Jeremy has a specific acceleration compared to airs mass. So in a way air has also acceleration compared to Jeremy. That plus the fact that air has its mass we can say that G  ma... Sry for not so clear explanation but just think about it...
TopGear All it needs is a fighter jet style cockpit and a bigger engine and it would be perfect
TopGear 0:20The prodigy: First Warning.Yer welcome.
TopGear I dont want to go in to much detail, but let me put it this way: If I was a girl, I would like it very much. hahaha
TopGear Grazie amico per averlo caricato
TopGear 3:20 baha he liked it the way karl pilkington would
TopGear aah so this is the bloody producer P
TopGear The real question is, do you know?
TopGear CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS
TopGear obama has destroyed our military,you can go to war for obama and die at eighteen or twentys,and then he will praise and fund the same people who killed you,or pull out after thousands have died and let them take back over,so your life is over for what,you are all pawns in his chess game,
TopGear Im now convinced you know is the American equipment for like
TopGear seriously why is there a top gear live
TopGear The Ford Focus badly needs a redesign. Ugly.
TopGear dancing gymkhana lolol
TopGear Grandeeeee, continua cos ()
TopGear Thor is causing the rain...just some.of u would be wondering
TopGear Its England, when isnt it wet?? S
TopGear Looks like thor has strucken him down with his......rain or summet like that.
TopGear I dont know much about cars and I certainly couldnt drive stick, but Tom? Well, he IS driving ME ... crazier.
TopGear Cowell nearly always drives himself, hes a big driving enthusiast and drives a Morgan Aero Coupe most of the time in the States.
TopGear Thor deliberately send rain to sabotage Lokis time lap
TopGear Blame Thor for the rain :P
TopGear never heard of tom hiddlestone
TopGear This was really fun to watch, but it still makes me a bit confused. So Top Gear go to New Zealand to race a Toyota Corolla against a yacht, but they still havent been to Australia to cover the Falcon? I hope they are planning to do a massive Australia episode because its about time they do.
TopGear this was one of the worst top gear episodes
TopGear The noise Jeremy makes at 0:29 is hilarious
TopGear James Mays reaction at the end is truly priceless. Hahaha!
TopGear So why was it called the Fastest Car again..? Ahehehe... Call me captain obvious but, I just have to make sure hehehe...
TopGear Thats still my favorite hehe:Koenigsegg One:1 2014 Geneva Motor Show HD
TopGear damned ! this is a super boat !
TopGear Stig with the umbrella.. Looks so dainty. LoL!
TopGear Hmm... So my best guess then is that the Stig is a Norwegian F1 Driver.
TopGear So.... Where is Stigs umbrella at the start?
TopGear You lost me at top gear people
TopGear so the stig is from norway?
TopGear Why doesnt the Stig have a white umbrella? And I thought Stig was waterproof...
TopGear Da dove le prendi le puntate?? :D
TopGear Kind of ironic how the GT3 has been delayed because it keeps bursting into flames
TopGear this is more slowed down than I expected. Look at the monitor in the background  you can see the individual frames, running 2hz. Assuming that theyre standard 60hz monitors, that means that in real time, these cars would appear to be going about 30x faster. Even if theyre 30hz thats pretty damn impressive.
TopGear i could watch this for hours ... all the small things look so amazing ... the slowly updating screen, the stage lights, the tyres spinning, the way the engine sucked in the flames in the end ... amazing. oh and the music is perfect for it too  btw anyone knows what it was?
TopGear Watch a behind the scenes video of this stunt here: INFERNO  Porsche 911 vs Flame Thowers  Top Gear Live
TopGear a burning porche ..... reminds me of paul walker .hope he enjoys his new life in heaven .
TopGear Need the Nickelback song here (Burn it to the ground).
TopGear This video is pretty hot
TopGear Does Hammond know youre doing this???
TopGear your video is so cool
TopGear Damn cool stunt! But how do you keep the audience from suffocating?
TopGear thats getting a bit desperate TG. next they will have cheese parties and giant tins of soup and shit.... i mean come on, its pretty... just not what i need as a viewer, from TG, to be entertained
TopGear This is a bloody good one from TopGear BICYCLING magazine topgear
TopGear Le Reddit Army is here!
TopGear Stupid joke. Cycling rules!
TopGear As a cyclist, I find this hilarious. It could be that I follow road laws, but either way its funny.
TopGear As a cyclist, spot on. Too many people run red lights. Numpties.
TopGear but not pedestrians? Thats not really fair. I think its OK for a cyclist to go thru a red if there is no one coming. Anyone who is getting to where they are going using their own energy and not being lazy in a car should be allowed to get there as fast as they can, safely of course. Hell a lot more drivers go thru yellows and reds than cyclists.
TopGear Im a cyclist I wholeheartedly agree.
TopGear Brilliant, Short, Simple, Effective.
TopGear An important lesson for cyclists: Top Gear Bicycle Advert
TopGear get the top gear guys to commentate Formula 1 hehe
TopGear Uhh.. Thats utterly ridiculous
TopGear you know its gonna be awesome when Jeremy, Richard, and james are in this
TopGear 10:31 Schwachfuchs den Ausdruck werde ich mir merken.
TopGear Topgear ist reine Show. Der Zuschauer soll unterhalten werden, mehr nicht. Und das machen sie auch recht gut.Dass die Rennen die sie da machen nur Spa sind, sollte jeder wissen.
TopGear I need a .... motherfuckers. at the end :D
TopGear Jako rowerzysta codziennie obserwujcy innych rowerzystw na ulicach, podpisuj si wszystkimi czonkami.
TopGear Tell us how you really feel Arch!(This vid is one of your best!)
TopGear Thanks Archie!!! One of your best vids...this is the old Archie shit that put you on the map...A...more please.
TopGear love this video, your the best. The guru, the one, the only, Archie. fuckers. big belly lmao keep up the good work.
TopGear I dont agree with what you call dog shit but that was still a funny vid.
TopGear Ive seen Richard Hammond wearing a submariner and a top gun
TopGear HEY! Dont badmouth GM V8s like that, let alone compare it to an ETA Movement!, V6 though fine that would make sense but they made some pretty awesome V8s over the years.The Buick 455 and the 454, the versitile and long lasting 350 CI V8 that allowed the Corvette to survive the 1970s despite them trying to kill it off and short changing itBook Club: Corvette Sting Ray  Jay Lenos GarageAmerican Muscle CarS1E07Buick Gran Sportand there was alot of love and tender care that went into it from Bob Lutz in 1976 after Zora left in 1974 with a Blue 454 Convertible, that he kept for many years afterwardsand all of those great all around crate motors they make nowadays, so if your gonna bad mouth some GM motor, pick the right one, namely the V6s Of which I had one crack on me, the engine block cracked right through, straight in half!I mean of all the damn things you could pick on, you choose the ONE solid part about an american GM car, the damn V8!hell even on that Holden the V8 is probably the best part of it!
TopGear the clip is always blocked here, so only available on sockshare. be sure u have adblock plus or another good pop up blocker installed before going on sockshare. visit on your own risk:http:www.sockshare.comfile422DE5F0AE9B3A88
TopGear mmmm...... i think the tundra did pull the endeavor but im not sure?
TopGear Something is wrong with the audio it is like a minute and a half off
TopGear You should do this to star trek
TopGear Babies are no good at building roads. Ha!
TopGear Hello horse! I shall call you Tesco! ROFL
TopGear Clarkson : HOLY MOLY!
TopGear Haha 5 legged stallion.
TopGear ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, i have watched this clip too many times now, but i still crack up every time.
TopGear I can see why they should be glue these things haha
TopGear such fucking idiots, they arent fighting, they love each other...
TopGear Holland is the best, drove there once, I nearly ran over 10 cyclists.
TopGear Toothpaste on my privates so she can brush her teeth. ..I wish.
TopGear Take a look at this video on YouTube:
TopGear I seem to see the worst drivers on the road cyclist or car driver alike. Ive seen a cyclist drive on the right side of the road where cars drive on the left, the cyclist almost got planted in my windscreen, didnt see him until I pulled out of my road.
TopGear Just get bicycles with shock absorbers,solves your scrotum problems
TopGear Whilst I just... insert this in the machine...I want to see the uncut version, where James goes on a long lecture about how DVDs work.
TopGear I nearly hit that bloke in the face
TopGear The thumbnail is adorable XD
TopGear Whats the ending whistle song?
TopGear Hammond lorries is from thailand
TopGear People think this is hilarious. For god shakes, theyve been pulling off same crappy stunts for the last decades...
TopGear Great job guys. I would love to have youre job. Even the miserable parts are a adventure
TopGear Back to watching old videos again... I wish there were more episodes in a top gear season. Its an addiction :(
TopGear Did you see sennas 1988 f1 car
TopGear Damn, US cab drivers need to step up their fame. We need Eclass as taxi here too instead of the Toyota Prius and old Crown Victorias. In Europe they drive them because those diesel engine last forever and the structure is as strong as a tank.
TopGear Whats your thoughts on 3D printer and will you be reviewing them in your channel in the future?
TopGear Omg was he driving it in auto?
TopGear End across the line!)
TopGear OMG I WANT TO DO THIS!
TopGear Great work mate, thanks for uploading.
TopGear They never let James finish a sentence, do they? Hmmm.
TopGear Check out this video on YouTube:
TopGear A american gas guzzler will do this job easily, own one myself and am proud of it.
TopGear I wouldve1) Turn all the lights, radio, aircond to maximum2) Roll down all windows to create wind drag3) Drive with the handbrake up4) Fill the car with a jackshitload of sand, dirt, rubbish
TopGear They actually do visitor tours to Chernobyl nowadays, its not that dangerous if you dont stay there for too long.
TopGear where can i watch the sequel
TopGear As an American who drives a V8 Muscle car, this cars have better fuel efficiency at there worst. My El Camino gets like 16 mpg
TopGear Am I the only one that is bothered by James terrible description of a half life?
TopGear what a pathetic program...dont they understand we need to save fuel ?? what a shit program !!these brits and americans teach us all sorts of advices we dont even ask for....and now what r de doing?? fucking hypocrites
TopGear In Ukraine? A total coincidence....Im sure...
TopGear good thing they went to Ukraine before SHTF , in the same fashion as the Syrian tour

TopGear Unfortunately the engine is over the front two wheels. The weight should be pushed back. If you could mount the engine in the back? Then make it float!!! Id better stop now.
TopGear 0:55 if you look closely there is a convenient stand on the camera mans tripod. Its a great place to rest his ginormous balls when filming slower cars.

GameSack Zac knocks people up and disables them. Then he ults and does it again, and keeps them slowed for a good three seconds. Then he qs and keeps them slowed for a few more seconds. At this point his E is probably coming off CD.

Ghost is good and all but only to a certain extent. frozen heart on him is really a maybe, if your team is wrecking shit then yea get it lol. otherwise very nice guides id say. really depends on how you want to build renekton. oh and by the way building him like a carry, doesnt fucking work. build hp resist and cd.
GameSack it sounds so with the programm he uses to speak with friends

TopGear Turn 10, why didnt you add these songs from these trailers as soundtracks in the game? Theyre actually pretty good.
TopGear Oh my, Ive never seen these cars in a Forza game before! Good job Turn 10! No! This car pack is a joke and makes Call of Duty Ghosts Spectrum camo look like a good idea.
TopGear umm wernet all these cars included in Forza 4??
TopGear Forza 5 has no salvation, seriously this game is lame, the amount of cars are ok, but the amount of tracks...also no auction house, the new storefront is terrible, this game has everything wrong.Turn 10, if youre doing Forza 6 or Horizon 2, PLEASE! made everything like forza 3 or 4! bring back the auction house, bring back the OLD STOREFRONT system, bring back the car clubs, you just did this game almost to make people to throw real money even after buying this game, youre destroying your name, I can tell you this because I have been following you guys since Forza 1 on the original Xbox.Im a Forza fan and I can see when shit its done, and Forza 5 its shit done. dont listen to the blinded Fanboys. listen to the Fans.If Forza 6 or Horizon 2 are like this game, people will start to leave...
TopGear Another solid pack keep up the good work!
TopGear SHOULD HAVE MADE FORZA 5 FOR XBOX 360!!!

TopGear Forza and Turn 10 please consider adding the Australian Manufactured ford falcon (factory model), you have the Holden (HSV 427), why not Ford?
TopGear Soundtrack is amazing!

TopGear Here is a link to download the amazing soundtrack of this game (plus some more). Its really hard to find even on the internet https:www.dropbox.comsrp0ghqug7a067unGRiNDSToNe2020GRiNDSToNe.rar
TopGear Top Gear Overdrive still cant quite live up to the legacy of the original, but its the best Top Gear game since then. With gorgeous graphics, excellent track design, fitting original music, fast and frantic races, great multiplayer racing, and a cool cashupgrade system, Top Gear Overdrive stands on its own as one of the N64s best racing experiences. Only the few problems of not enough tracks, lacking features, touchy control, and a difficulty setting thats a little too easy detract from the game. Otherwise, its a great game for both arcade racing fans and for those looking for something more akin to PlayStation racing games. A tremendous first effort by the small group at Snowblind Studios.
TopGear Ciaooo dolcezzza  stato davvero piacevole poterti conoscere meglio, ti ringrazio davvero tantissimooo per avermi taggata :D risponder al tuo tag ad aprile xk mi ero messa daccordo con una ragazza per realizzare in collaborazione questo tag, ti citer sicuramente per ringraziarti nuovamente, un bacione tesoro, e sei sempre bellissimaaaaa :D

TopGear isnt it funny when actuall truckers watch this thinking finally big trucks then this happened
TopGear Whats the deal with the audio on most of these videos?
TopGear Did anyone see that ae86 in the background on the highway????
TopGear what happened to their voices?
TopGear Why does it sound like they all have deep voices that sound the same? :S
TopGear Y is the picture. Cropped in all of your video s
TopGear The new revolutionary Popes car
TopGear jesus dude, if your going to upload a vid at least do us the favor of taking out the stupid recap bullshit every 5 minutes. not to mention the first 10 minutes of the video repeats itself.
TopGear Why the distorted low quality video?
TopGear Really, the stock IH 345 replaced by a Chrysler 318, idiots!
TopGear I dont know which is worse, the sped up voices so they sound like chipmunks, or the slowed down voices like on this video so they sound like its all dubbed. This blows. Why cant anyone post videos like the UK show videos? I need to just buy the series if I can find it.
TopGear You should come to Nova scotia, and let me drive lol
TopGear 3 seconds faster than the Merc, AND having Rutt in the passenger seat? Leave his ass on the sidelines, bet the Stig would get under 1:10.
TopGear Love the Boxter, but seeing it here it just screams midlife crisis. The corvette is the classier one period.
TopGear What about the Copperhead ?
TopGear that dodge is awesome
TopGear Noooooooooooo! The house XD

TopGear What does James say at the end that made JC laugh? andasyoucouldhaveimaginedivedonethisproperly? Why is that funny :P ?

TopGear i remember watching this interview (full and HD) somewhere else, cant remember exactly where. why it wasnt broadcasted anyway?BTW thanks for uploading it!!! Loved how he said ...your accent youre so sneaky with American accent.
TopGear I worked hard. In the military. Then I received a massive head injury the complications of which precluded me from being able to drive a car. How refreshing to see people on the internet propose the brilliant notion that bicyclists deserve any type of violence that comes their way. Makes me glad I live in the 21st century.
TopGear 2:20 that sound when you look at reaktor 4
TopGear Get in the cockpit of a MercedesBenz SLS GT3 race an E63 V8 at the Sydney Motorsport Park.
TopGear Richard driving god Hammond.. Who remembers that from one of the early series? LOL
ZONEofTECH I dont get the health bit. Is this the only direction Apple can see going? is this the only thing left?
ZONEofTECH Really well made video! Youre a smart guy!
ZONEofTECH iPod touch 6th gen? No one intrested in that?
ZONEofTECH I just hope apple comes out with something better than whatever else is out there  Samsung gear, Pebble, etc. just a Nano like the one in 2010 with Bluetooth, ability to view notifications, reject or answer calls, weather. That would do it for me. Maybe the ability to respond quickly to texts  yes, no, ok, sounds good, on my way, etc.
ZONEofTECH I hate how people are so worried about battery life. You charge your phone every night, is it that hard to just plug a cord in along with your phone?
ZONEofTECH If it was up to me I would use solar.
ZONEofTECH They should try doing the phone thats in total recall. It is installed in your wrist and charges of the electricity in your brain
ZONEofTECH I can understand why Andrew Garfield is hosting these types of videos... Peter Parker is a genius you know. )
ZONEofTECH its gonna take you alot of japanese punchlines to charge that gyroscope
ZONEofTECH The iWatch concept by Zach( FinalCutPro) King is my favorite
ZONEofTECH 3 concept is nice, but controlling area is too less.
ZONEofTECH can you talk about the new mac book pro 2014?
ZONEofTECH Very passionate and knowledgable
ZONEofTECH Is it just me or does he look like Drake Bell??

ZONEofTECH i liked it thank you!! :)
ZONEofTECH They make a new iPhone every 3 years or so, its not even been 1 year yet, I doubt they will have even decided on anything for the iPhone 6
ZONEofTECH In the middle of the video it shows a picture if tuberculosis
ZONEofTECH thanks for the infos...
ZONEofTECH Great video, but that drop shadow
ZONEofTECH Is it me or do you look a lot like Andrew Garfield?
ZONEofTECH Who else thinks he looks like the new SpiderMan?
ZONEofTECH cant understand a bloody word they are saying ugh!! they should have people who speak fluent English to demonstrate their products!
ZONEofTECH Lmao.. The David park guy had to clap for himself for people to cheer..... hahaha
ZONEofTECH In my opinion the most important things on a SMARTPHONE are that u can change the Battery, water resistance, camera and the features. I dont think that iPhone will ever have a better camera, features and so on. If u want a nice Design and a very simple phone then take the 5s. But if u are someone who want to make something more with a Smartphone then i would take the s5 or the z2. But the men buttons Integrated in the Display sucks as well. So 5.2 inches at the z2 turn to 4.7. Samsung is the best choice i think. I have a s3 and i hate it, i sweared that i never buy a samsung again. But the market show me that the samsung is the best choice. My friends cant go through a half day with a iPhone because of the low Battery. HTC is not a option at all and the only concurrent of the s5 will be the z2 for the Moment. Waiting for iPhone 6
ZONEofTECH You are totally correct about the increase in ppi wont make much of a difference. But the increase of resolution does have some benefits. It gives the option the stream your devices display to an external 2k display in its native form (not really usefull for the masses) and the development of a higher res display will push other things like saturation and viewing angles. In the end I do think that a 1080p display is the best resolution for a high end phone because most of us wont see the difference, it benefits battery life and performance. But everyone knows that people in reviews will be all about the 2k resolution and how great it is, and we all know that annoying friend who brags about this display: which is exactly what Samsung wants (they are not dumb you know :)
ZONEofTECH Im normally very skeptical about watching a rumour video from a source thats not trustworthy, but you truly did a great job.
ZONEofTECH How do we get Kit Kat on Samsung Galaxy S4?
ZONEofTECH Keep up the awesome videos. :)
ZONEofTECH S to the question of whether the Galaxy gear 1 was a prototype or if the Galaxy gear 2 is a rushed replacement, I can think of a third option. The galaxy gear 1 was a test of sorts. It wasnt a prototype as you indicated, but rather a concept test to see what the market was before ramping up production and RD. It is likely that Samsung was developing multiple versions of the Galaxy gear at the same time. The gear 1 was only a proof of concept model to generate interest in such a device. The gear 2 will be the culmination of the original design and the feedback from the gear 1. This means Samsung wouldnt have had to redesign from scratch in only 5 months, instead, they would have been designing since the RD department first proposed the gear concept. My guess is that the gear 2 has more than a year of design and development under its hood.
ZONEofTECH Sonny DICKson Ahha I was watching this right In front of my parents nd they take the video off and watch another one too joke
ZONEofTECH At 3:08..... If you know what I mean......
ZONEofTECH It is going to be the same as all of the others they never Change. The galaxy is way better
ZONEofTECH Needs a better battery
ZONEofTECH omg it looks exactly like the samsung thats so stupid
ZONEofTECH Your very handsome c: js
ZONEofTECH People say that apple is copying Samsung but Samsung copied apple with the galaxy s5, it comes in gold and blue and has fingerprint scanner I mean come on bumping up the screen size is not copying if it was then LG would be copied too!
ZONEofTECH ok we get the design we know what itll look like they have 789 all lined up its milk technology

ZONEofTECH nice vid bro....my macbook coming tomorrow
ZONEofTECH sigh... It was battlefields fault for crashing, not the laptop. That game has more bugs than anything made by Bethesda.
ZONEofTECH u can actually hear the fan boosting which means the macbook is struggling to be cooled.
ZONEofTECH Hey zoneoftech, thanks for the helpful video. i had this same model arrived yesterday. Even after updating my graphic card i cant get this performance on my macbook. I also had razor game booster and my nvidia 3d settings to default. Its worse. Can can you help me please.Thanks
ZONEofTECH Dude I like your video but very bad quality
ZONEofTECH Hi I just got the 2.6ghz, 1 terabyte ssd. 15 MacBook pro yesterday. This thing is powerful. For premiere pro and after effects, I had to download the nvidia cuda unlock. I cant believe how smooth it runs with multiple effects. I am very happy with this machine. Final cut pro runs like a champ too. However, mts files must be transcoded. I gotta try few games and see how it performs.
ZONEofTECH Youre awesome man, you need more views and subscribers!
ZONEofTECH Does it really take that long for a typical iPhone? I thought it was around 1520 seconds. Guess I never timed it.
ZONEofTECH Lenovo Y510p is better for half the price.
ZONEofTECH this video should have at LEAST a couple 10 000 likes.
ZONEofTECH any YELLOW tint screen issue??? check macrumors forum, a lot people report the issue!

ZONEofTECH i think N5 dont have transparent screen lamination like N4 had... so better buy screen protector in advance
ZONEofTECH Sorry for the reupload. The timer was off  it was on fastforward while the video wasnt. This resulted in double the bootup time for the previous video. This one has been fixed. Thank you for noticing! Dan ZONEofTECH
ZONEofTECH The black iPhone 5 looks awesome but I prefer the Space Gray color, it lasts longer because its less prone to scratches.
ZONEofTECH i dont read terms and conditions they are a waste of time and i dont understand half the text
ZONEofTECH You are Romanian? Where do you steal the apple products from? 0oJust a bad joke sorry D

ZONEofTECH Done I did everything

ZONEofTECH Huh lol my s3 boots up in 15 seconds on stock and a lot of apps and games
ZONEofTECH no sweat, at least its good to know that you try your best for the subscribers :)
ZONEofTECH To actually figure out which phone is faster both phones have to be brand new and never used. Otherwise it is unfair and the chip in the 4s is obviously older which means it has been weared a lot more than the 5c. So obviously 4s is going to be slower. plus the iphone 5c was optimized for ios7 and 4s wasnt. Therefore this is an unfair comparison and wont actually prove what phone is faster. since the 4s is loaded with ios7. ios7 is just an extra to slow down the 4s.
ZONEofTECH my iPod touch 5th gen took 33 secs interesting
ZONEofTECH I just won a iphone 5c for 120 also fixing the lcd so it will be my everyday use and it will replace my iphone 3g. Come on iphone 6.... when are they going to launch it..
ZONEofTECH Although 5C is faster, in therms of design I would definitely choose the 4S
ZONEofTECH Obviously the 5c is quicker its got a faster processor so this test is just pointless
ZONEofTECH I am still I love with 4s the design and build quality its just gorgeous , and for more mine is jailbroken on iOS 6 :)
ZONEofTECH I know this has nothing to do with the video, but seriously dude, you are quite a handsome dudep
ZONEofTECH U look like the guy who played SpiderMan :)
ZONEofTECH Really good video, by the way. What Apple Store is this?

ZONEofTECH hi ... I got I question ..hmm so the ipad 5 is coming out or not ?
ZONEofTECH They would sell this plastic iPhone, alongside the iPhone 5  5S. So they wont switch to plastic entirely. Only the cheaper iPhone 5C will be made out of plastic.
ZONEofTECH Which background are u using???
ZONEofTECH I love to be the first to comment. Cool video
ZONEofTECH everytime I try to connect my macbook air with the tv it says The Arrangement tab of Displays preferences is hidden because you only have a single display attached to this computer what should i do?
ZONEofTECH when doing this, say if my moniter is larger than my laptop screen and im using word, does the monitor have the ability to show more or the word document, or is it just expanded and blown up to fit the screen?
ZONEofTECH The SD card was around 30 or 20.
ZONEofTECH did anyone see the girl in the background
ZONEofTECH I want to win the ball!
ZONEofTECH View, Like and Sub! Im waiting for more Vids )
ZONEofTECH Soll ich das Video jetzt auf Twitter stellen!!!
ZONEofTECH Theres no way that thats an actually Apple product. It look just like a custom casing for an iPhone 5 some company came up with.
ZONEofTECH I actually kinda want it.
ZONEofTECH Once this gets released, I might get my hands on one, review it and then give it away to a lucky viewer. Like this comment if you would like an iPhone Plastic GIVEAWAY, once it gets released!
ZONEofTECH the one with a hairy chest

ZONEofTECH Maverick is a reference to surfing not a cowboy. wiki pedia.orgwikiMavericks28location29
ZONEofTECH I work in IT for for government and I love it when some dumbass says i just dont know why the army doesnt switch to mac?.... duhhh.. maybe cuz it costs 100150 more for the same or lesser hardware. but they would not need to spend so much on IT... bullshit, there are always people who need software installed, software or operating system configurations, knocking out a power cable and all that shit... it would not make ANY difference. Mac are such gimmicks
ZONEofTECH I loved the boooooo part
ZONEofTECH I found one of these at Wal mart for 60. It says you can connect through firewire 800, do you have any idea how to do that?
ZONEofTECH i could do this allready with a pioneer radio
ZONEofTECH if I get ios 7 beta when the real one comes out can I update to it
ZONEofTECH When the icons move its called parallax not dynamic wallpaper
ZONEofTECH It is an interactive review. You can click to go to specific parts. The ENTIRE review is 1h long.

ZONEofTECH This Video Helped me alot but how do i restore my phone from an iOS 7 icloud backup?
ZONEofTECH you really saved me!!! awesome vid. thank you!! i erased all content and settings on ios 7 and got the error.
ZONEofTECH iOS 7 beta 1 and 5 cannot update on my iPhone 5 GSM now I still using ios 7 beta 4
ZONEofTECH are you kidding me man,i already threw mines in the trash already,my friend told me about this video and now im mad.
ZONEofTECH Thank you so much i had Iphone 3 and i already wanted to throw it away but i saw your video ! I am in sub!
ZONEofTECH WOW! Steve Jobs subscribed to my channel! AWESOMMMMME!
ZONEofTECH I have tried to do everything you said but when i open recboot and click enter recovery, nothing happens which makes my phone stay stuck at that position, what do i do?

ZONEofTECH I said that at the end of the video :D Looks like somebody got bored and didnt watch it until the end hahahaha :D
ZONEofTECH I cant get my music to play :
ZONEofTECH A COVER WALL MODE of Music.app on iOS 7 is so very UGLY!! It make too hard that I choose the music which I would like to listen to. and I want to watch my music videos on Landscape mode!
ZONEofTECH OMG I share an iTunes account with my mom and all she ever listens too is kelly clarkson and Michael bubl.
ZONEofTECH For the othet country iTunes Radio is not avilable yet. But if you create an US account it run!
ZONEofTECH Cool I updated to iOS 7 sick thanks for the info!!!!!
ZONEofTECH By what standard? One could easily build a Windows or Linux PC with the same specs for less than this will cost. Sure, it wont look like a trash can, or have that cool looking way of cooling it, but that really isnt that big of a deal.
ZONEofTECH reminds me of one of those dirty radioactive click click flying trashcan ufos. whoever is flying in them.
ZONEofTECH Android  Windows Phone  IOS 7
ZONEofTECH Airdrop can send only pictures, videos (mp4 only) because apple only supports this format, and maybe documents and thats it and only to iOS and mac devices. With Android you can send what you want on every device. And also when you dont have a internet connection you can share your music, videos, pictures etc via bluetooth with your friend with no restrictions, but only in android.
ZONEofTECH No iPhone 4S?? That sucks
ZONEofTECH Can you airdrop from a Mac to iOS?
ZONEofTECH You dont need WiFi Android fan boy!
ZONEofTECH how did apple not think it would be a good idea to be able to share songs through airdrop considering that android phones can. smh what a let down.
ZONEofTECH Well I wouldnt rather bumping my phone with others and making sure ALL my friends can bump them with mine.
ZONEofTECH nope it works over bluetooth. Thats why its called Airdrop: you drop it in the air, and everybody close by can receive it. Thats why it only works with people close by.
ZONEofTECH When the beta expires there will be an update (iOS 7 beta 2) and you can update to that and it will keep doing that until they get to the final version.
ZONEofTECH looks like wp8 multitasking to m3
ZONEofTECH It seems that a lot of people hate the new multitasking :P I wonder why :D
ZONEofTECH Very good upgrade ! Love it... Ios in the car is really great
ZONEofTECH i think il buy the new iphone
ZONEofTECH She sounds so realistic! I love it!
ZONEofTECH And they also see it off copying Samsung ans getting fined Anyone with me no? Yes? Wel if you havent heard they did copy Samsung somehow and got fined for it
ZONEofTECH I was the last one to like and you should thank me I gave you a last like that reached to 100!!! Great video! Stop being mean,haters!
ZONEofTECH I would want this but i wouldnt want to be the one to pay for it lol
ZONEofTECH No one cares that you got a A and if youre under 16, oh well boohoo, not everyone is fortunate like me. If youre much over 16, get a job loser.
ZONEofTECH I would like to win the iPod touch because I nevered owned one because my parents dont have an of money for it
ZONEofTECH boompje had been shut down
ZONEofTECH its telling me to relaunch. help. i relaunch and it doesnt work. help
ZONEofTECH Thx man you helped my friend
ZONEofTECH when i try to open it it sais that the application as closed and doesnt let me open it
ZONEofTECH :D nice voice much better then the old ONE
ZONEofTECH Dude this video freaks me out especially its too loud
ZONEofTECH They wont, because the hyper fast response wireless system they are using for the new ones. You can always just keep the 360 until youve built your librar of new games
ZONEofTECH sry should of said is the controller like the crap play and change or the nice charging station
ZONEofTECH how is it a piece of shit? Its the same damn hardware as the ps4 AMD 8 core APU with 8GB DDR3. If anything it has an advantage over the ps4 in that it has a redesigned Kinect, but beyond that theyre both low end PCs.
ZONEofTECH Ps4 still looks better
ZONEofTECH Not really my your machine cant even utilize 8 gigs of your ram so there technically not that outdated plus most people have 8 gigs of ram anyways.
ZONEofTECH Red !!! The color that fits with ipod touch . I hope I can win the giveaway .
ZONEofTECH The shelf on fifth video is the best idea. I dont understand why some people want ios to look like android or windows phone, if they want it so much then get a WP or adroid device. Number 1 looks awful.
ZONEofTECH Number one is the worst idea ever!!
ZONEofTECH Or you could jb your phone and choose which of these you want :)
ZONEofTECH I wish icons were square there still rounded :C
ZONEofTECH Like if you vote Number 1 :D
ZONEofTECH my top 5 on my wish list is: 5.automatic app update 4.get custom ios themes 3.better multitasking 2. quick reply for texting 1.widgets
ZONEofTECH 1. Is best and the last is bullshit
ZONEofTECH Yall? gtfo red neck fucker. I am an xbox gamer. My frist console. My best console.
ZONEofTECH Ok what the hell happened to the world? Plastic???!!!!!!!! Just why apple? Just why
ZONEofTECH not htc! i had one, and it wasent good! I would probably say nokia lumia 920 windows phone instead, or sony!:)
ZONEofTECH This video was made in April you idiot!
ZONEofTECH Looks cheap and tacky!
ZONEofTECH Sam Aaron if you dont like apple, why are you watching a video about apple?
ZONEofTECH try the cheap plastic iPhone
ZONEofTECH no its still freaking expensive man
ZONEofTECH I have a Galaxy Note 2. An I wanna get the Mega 6.3 maybe a few months down the road. I love big phone form factor. Yah, an haha I would answer it without a hands free. I want a Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3.
ZONEofTECH S3 mini is better you ass!
ZONEofTECH Samsung galaxy s3 mini is the best 4 ever...!! :)
ZONEofTECH I have the iPhone 3 GS for 2 years and is an amazing smartphone, this little device really improve my life with several apps and performance. I love apple products and now I want to get a new phone but the iPhone 5 is really too expensive here in South America is just unaffordable (750 with my monthly plan) and for that reason I want to buy another option that brings me the same quality and features than iOS but with half of price. Sorry for my English.
ZONEofTECH Congratulation to my favourite phone (S3 mini
ZONEofTECH Be fair lah. Must also show 16 GB for s3 mini lah. At first I found it fair. So I like your video and now I dislike.
ZONEofTECH Are you serious? A crap phone vs an iphone 4s? An iphone 3gs would be a better competition jeez
ZONEofTECH This was an amazing comaprission
ZONEofTECH Love how you call siri and svoice , your pocket bitch hahahaha
ZONEofTECH Can duel of Samsung galaxi Express vs Iphone 4S
ZONEofTECH Wheres the call quality test?
ZONEofTECH s3 mini is good bit bigger and awesome it is the best i phone bye bye
ZONEofTECH Its not a real multitask thats why iphones has only 512mb of ram memory!
ZONEofTECH Wooooh!!! YEY Still for iPhone  Apple is Unbeatable hehehe LOL (just for me) Peace for other gadget users
ZONEofTECH s3 mini vs 4s tie , S3 vs 4s  S3 , S4 vs iPhone 5 S4 , Samsung Vs Apple  Samsung for 2 at 1 :P Done
ZONEofTECH You mean upload the sample for each phone?
ZONEofTECH In video iphone and fhoto s3 mini
ZONEofTECH Thanks, very helpful !!
ZONEofTECH Is the SIII Mini can play HD Movie or cannot??
ZONEofTECH i meant video i got over exited :D
ZONEofTECH Id like to have that S3 Mini
ZONEofTECH zoneoftech what color shuld i choose?.. cause my mom will buy me this phone.
ZONEofTECH I have no problem with this phone , when im playing heavy games like nova 3 it works perfectly
ZONEofTECH The grand the big one it sooooooooo much better
ZONEofTECH does this phone have NFC???
ZONEofTECH Why not just touch it
ZONEofTECH i don get it people really hate the s4 but still watching video about it LOL, if you hate the s4 just don buy it simple as that.
ZONEofTECH Cant decide if i should by the samsung galaxy s4 or iphone 5, or the next iphone...
ZONEofTECH the screen is amazing , but 5 inches? it seems like a phablet (smarpthone  tablet in one).
ZONEofTECH watchany1 oh really? Your the stupidest person on earth arnt you? :)
ZONEofTECH Cannot wait to get mine I have a s3 and it good so emagine s4 wow
ZONEofTECH Cannot wait to get mine I have a s3 and it good so emagine s4 wow
ZONEofTECH I will be buying the GS4 and it is a lot better than the Iphone 5. By the way...13 megapixel camera! Plus 2 megapixel front camera! To top it all off...has like a 421 or 400 something ppi screen. Best Phone on the market! You also forgot group play I think and I think the chat on app has some features special to the GS4. Awesome phone!
ZONEofTECH revenge....u mean sue watever thing? xD
ZONEofTECH Its Better Than the iphone 5...............
ZONEofTECH I was about to get the galaxy s3 mini but ill wait for this baby to come
ZONEofTECH u just wanna some likes and shares on facebook ..
ZONEofTECH Thank you for the videos you been posting. Im going to like you on Facebook. Galaxy 4 is epic.
ZONEofTECH i dont know why people say is too big, gonna be 5 in the screen just little more bigger than s3. the different gonna be just less than 12 in is not extremely big like the note.
ZONEofTECH Most models will probably be stuck to 4 cores due to battery life.
ZONEofTECH yep its like having a brick in your pocket
ZONEofTECH iFags be like iphone 6 is coming. S3  S4 iphone

ZONEofTECH I am taking courses for Computer Graphics and Would love to Utilize the Capabilities of my New MacBook Pro 13inch Mid 2012 I never owned a mac until the university sent one to me, so I asked them is the MacBook a requirement or can I throw it in the corner and use my windows Laptop and they said yes you may but when it was delivered to me and checking the requirements of Photoshop CS6 my laptop doesnt have the required 3D Capabilities and Hardware that the MacBook does and yet I have the full version of Photoshop CS6 for Windows Which of course I cannot use it on Mac OS X Mavericks and so therefore I need the Win 8 for my new Mac For my Schooling. Thank you for your Consideration, Sincerely yours.
ZONEofTECH i need it for my school and i have not much money any more because there is been stolen at our home :(
ZONEofTECH I understand. But if you really want to get the 1000 subscriber mark quickly, minimize the steps. And yeah, I subscribed. Not because of the contest but because you have some good videos out there. Well, Good Luck Bro!
ZONEofTECH I need windows 8 because I need to make gaming video because all my pc broke
ZONEofTECH I want it so that I can use it for school. Thank you.
ZONEofTECH I want to win because i want the windows 8 and i cant afford it and i hope you have the best of luck with your great youtube channel.

ZONEofTECH to get the windows 8 ISO file you need to BUY a full copy on windows 8
ZONEofTECH This is the most fakes thing in my life . Guys wait when u see the new I pad on tv
ZONEofTECH To all the people who disliked the video because of the inaccurate March release date 1) The video has been made in December of 2012 (yeah! more than half a year ago). Back in December, March was believed to be the release date for the iPad 5. 2) Everything I said in the video (except from the release date and possibly the A7 CPU) is going to be true. This means: iPad Mini design slight increase in speed same price same battery life same 163264128 gb capacities
ZONEofTECH iPad 4 is out too....

ZONEofTECH I just ordered the i phone 5 yesterday, what should I do? I want the 5S. I mean, why not?
ZONEofTECH Lmao its July and its not out its not true.....
ZONEofTECH WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG. Apple has Airdrop, so no NFC. iPhone 5S is coming out in October.
ZONEofTECH most likely 128 GB will be available for the iphone 5S
ZONEofTECH i think it will be similar
ZONEofTECH I think the iphone 5s will be a really big upgrade and make history by selling out in less than an hour.
ZONEofTECH yeah but can you make a phone call with it ??
ZONEofTECH i hate the ipod song managing in the new update
ZONEofTECH What OS are you using?

ZONEofTECH I use my own operating system called MNJ it is the best you guys can get a iso copy just email me at mitchellcarsgmail.com
ZONEofTECH Well when you have 8 cores and 8 gigs of ram windows doesnt touch your resources...Fact is, they are marketing to people that dont know anything about computers, which are generally the same people who love call of duty games...tell me dillon1108 do you love call of duty games?
ZONEofTECH You got EVERY single detail wrong. I could have at least gotten one right
ZONEofTECH Ducking stupid vid the Wii u is BAD
ZONEofTECH Thats pretty much what all consoles are... Man.... consoles blow. Well i guess if you cant afford a computer its better. But you will never achieve the same level of gaming that you can on computer with a console.
ZONEofTECH Look at the kinect 360 hahahhaa fool
ZONEofTECH 2GB of GDDR5 seems pretty likely, probably with 2Gb of DDR3, maybe with some eDram, though a straight up 4GB of GDDR5 would probably be more desireable for devs. The 256MB of XDR in PS3 ran at 26GBs (I think the 256 of GDDR3 was like 22GBs), GDDR5 can be anything from 72GBs (at 128bit) to 240GBs (on 384Bit), this would be massive compared to whats in PS3, maybe even 2GB of GDDR5 somewhere in the middle would be fine for everything, DDR3 may not be needed.
ZONEofTECH Only 4 cores and 2GB of graphics memory? Wtf are you bitching about?
ZONEofTECH I like both consoles, both have good exclusives, Xbox is usually better for most multiplats because those games are developed on the 360 first, then ported to PS3 without extra effort to make the most of the cell  RSX combined in PS3. IMO it balances out because the PS3 has a decent selection of its own exclusives that interest me more than 360s 1st party games, though I do love Gears, Fable, Forza, Halo. Sony has a more varied selection  wider range of 1st partyexclusive stuff.
ZONEofTECH oh... so you cant play ranked right?..
ZONEofTECH step 5 not random button
ZONEofTECH how do i get protoss free on starcraft 2 starter edition?
ZONEofTECH lol its not a glich but i think you already know that!
ZONEofTECH doesnt work any more my friend tried didnt succsed
ZONEofTECH Really :D Great :D I actually thought they removed the glitch since some users reported me that I doesnt work anymore. Thx for the feedback! Be sure to LIKE and SHARE the video so more people can see it. Also, please SUBSCRIBE to my channel to support my effort :0 Cheers!
ZONEofTECH you will be to get to the max (not lvl 5 that is only for starter edition) lvl on every species?
ZONEofTECH hey man Im YloSwagTroll from starcraft 2 contact me
ZONEofTECH The one that Im showing in the video in tethered. BUT there is a semi tethered workaround if you go to the website in the description. With semi untethered you can boot but safari,mail and messages are unusable until you connect it to a computer.
ZONEofTECH wow, sorry. I just noticed this. Yeah, I know the differences between the two. GV is for android devices and it is fully integrated into the OS, like Siri is, while GVS is just an app for iOS which lets you search using your voice. The only difference between the 2 things is that one of them GV is fully integrated into the OS. My bad, I think even in the video I kept saying Google Voice instead of GVC. Changing the title right away. Thx for noticing!
ZONEofTECH This is called TV AD? Are advertisements in US truly four minutes long?
ZONEofTECH Lets take the LIKE bar to 100 likes shall we :D ?
ZONEofTECH I always wonder how those super huge graphic cards are shrunk down to fit into these imacsmac book pros.. Do they really perform the same with the full sized graphic cards? I mean, they dont have any cooling fans or what not,, I just dont see how it could work..
ZONEofTECH Have shared to FB,good vidThanx :)
ZONEofTECH You didnt mention the other app! Is there a better one ?
ZONEofTECH Niggardly thats no iPhone 5 u dumbass
ZONEofTECH That 3G connection was working overtime.
ZONEofTECH Just 3 words. Pan X Cash (Just Google it) my wife has been generating 2000 every 30 days using it
ZONEofTECH Stopped watching this as soon as you said social blade. The earnings on that first page are so incredibly broad! For ex. TheSyndicateProject earns 400k 4Mil? That isnt very clear
ZONEofTECH in case i update my ipad 3 4G would the baseband be locked to carriers?
ZONEofTECH it will release in oct 29 64gb cost 439
ZONEofTECH Youre basically quoting the words and explaining the pics. I could do that myself. Not very helpful
ZONEofTECH I will wait for iPad mini. I hope it will come in many colors too
ZONEofTECH Everyone check out the galaxy player 5.0 it is the iPod killer
ZONEofTECH Cheers and thx for all the likes :D !
ZONEofTECH Yes, it has been released! :D
ZONEofTECH damm which colour ?? :
ZONEofTECH REALLY:0 I am shitting my pantss already.
ZONEofTECH does it have built in speakeea
ZONEofTECH Who the fuck are you? You said everyone copy Apple, fuck no!!You better watch this video (Has Apple Really Ever Invented Anything?)
ZONEofTECH 1 apple copied alot from samsung and other androidwathever devices
ZONEofTECH You just underminded your whole argument IF prada was designing a phone simular to the iphone WITHOUT knowing anything about it (as it was only revealed months before its release and LG was already long done with its design of its smartphone) then they didnt copy. And thats the reality the market was already long moving in that direction. LG Apple and a couple others were the first to take advantage of it.
ZONEofTECH No, youre a moron. I did a lot of research unlike you. APPLE didnt invent the tablet, Microsoft had the PC tablet way before Apple introduced the iPad (although they had an iPad prototype back in the 80). You really are a complete idiot, SONY didnt EVEN have ultrabooks before the MacBook Air, and Apple introduced the chiclet keyboard if you have any idea what that is. Now, every single laptop has one. Get real.
ZONEofTECH Scrie acolo Ghid de pornire rapida , deci teai dat de gol ca esti roman!
ZONEofTECH who cares about the pixels there both about the same
ZONEofTECH Guys I started with iPhone on the iPhone 3g then I got the 4s then the 5c and 5s which are both epic
ZONEofTECH lol, you think you are funny replying to your own comment
ZONEofTECH u barely turn the phone on when it turns on your like okay bye nobody wants to know what the box says dude gosh
ZONEofTECH Where did you get one of these? Ive wanted to get one, but they dont sell them now cuz the iPhone 5 came out. I would even get a used one
ZONEofTECH What is the difference between iPhone 3G vs iphone3gs and please make a speed test.
ZONEofTECH Yeah, in terms of speed is sometimes even faster than the iPhone 4. Really...I tested it out.
ZONEofTECH Whats the song at the beginning?
ZONEofTECH ZONEofTECH the answer to your question is you
ZONEofTECH Yes, I do :D Oh yeah....oh yeah..baby....your corners are soooooo sexxxxxxxxxyyyyy
ZONEofTECH Looks like the iPhone 5S box
ZONEofTECH yeah!!!! just resolved it. it was just a matter of authentication from apple inc ... when i double left click on its icon a window had appeared. it said the app you are using has no authentication certificate... and i thought that it was a kind of incompatibility.but is ok... just ignore this window and i followed what you have showed up here.is so cooooool as cartman from sp could say!:)
ZONEofTECH Running latest version of OSX and Samsung 840 250gb and this worked as described :)
ZONEofTECH Can I use ONYX and Ccleaner with SSD disk?
ZONEofTECH No problem :D Im glad I was able to help you. Be sure to like me on Facebooktwitter and I would really appreciate if you could share some of my videos on Facebooktwitter as well, so I could help more people not just you :) Thank you!

ZONEofTECH Umm not everyone is made of money and ios6 crashes so no :L
ZONEofTECH I got Samsung Evo 840 SSD and they are incredible fast than HDD. Good thing I got mine on Amazon and they are on sale for SSD  amzn.o1aUNmtO
ZONEofTECH I know this is on a mac but would you get the same results using windows 8 with same specs
ZONEofTECH I have a 5400RPM HDD, and I cant hear anything unless I literally put my ear on the macbook. I think its just the sound of the fan that Im hearing as well, and not the HDD.
ZONEofTECH Whats the point in my HP Windows 8.1 Laptop I got SSD and HDD at the same time :P
ZONEofTECH Yes, I do like grapes :D SUBSCRIBE to my channel, I might post some grape videos pretty soon :)
ZONEofTECH does it make any sense which RAM I buy? Do I need a special RAM card?
ZONEofTECH Will this work on the current mac book pro 15 inch? (As of June 25, 2013)
ZONEofTECH is this for free or what
ZONEofTECH Its a video of course hes supposed to talk would you rather have him stay quiet?! i prefer more talking because it means more information
ZONEofTECH Better than the iPod Shuffle.
ZONEofTECH Or just make one, cheaper, and more efficient.

retrogametech 4:00 MYST! OMG! One of the best PC games ever! If not, the best.
retrogametech ArcadeMameMachine Yeah, if someone bought it me as a present Id love it.
retrogametech ryanc519 Why not? Its probably one of the best games Ive played on the PS3. Top quality game.
retrogametech Damn fucking right Gears of War is in that book.
retrogametech I got this book for christmas, it makes me so happy!
retrogametech My Dreamcast ended up with a hole drilled in it when I tried to get the screws out to press in the contacts at the front (a common problem) and used a removable screw head (it got stuck), had to get it drilled out. It worked fine after though. Tried it recently and it carried on a bit and the ground became see through in Crazy Taxi.
retrogametech RetroGameTech to bad this not the prob with mine
retrogametech Was that smoke blue? If so, awsome!
screenjunkies RL J Joo neve  meio Targaryen. hehe.
screenjunkies Ok, who is this damn trailer really does not like the Hobbit saga will surely be happy with the new Justin Bieber movie. Id rather lose 6 hours of my life traveling around Middle Earth than seeing the rest of the junk Hollywood usually produces.
screenjunkies as aguias s no deixaram os anes na montanha, por que tinha um drago do tamanho do mundo, que acordou com o barulho de um tordo batendo na pedra.
screenjunkies yeah this is hilarious XD only good friends could do this
screenjunkies never heard of this guy but doesnt look like i could stand him very much
screenjunkies Haha true true too true
screenjunkies I really want to see more parodies of YouTubers now.
screenjunkies Ok. Cool. Congrats to him! Also, nice use of Honest Trailers to make new content. I hope Screen Junkies actually makes a nod to you as youve done for them. :D
screenjunkies Are you trying to sell this guys channel or satirize, as you describe, his sub par content?
screenjunkies How about doing an Honest Trailers about Honest Trailers?
screenjunkies All the coolest people on YouTube in one video. My favorate guest was the nostalgia critic

screenjunkies We saw him coughing so much my throat started aching.
screenjunkies Traduza esse por favor watch?vUfQxrHzelE
screenjunkies Breaking Bad vai deixar saudades mesmo.
screenjunkies Esse filme foi to bom que at hoje eu no tive vontade de ver,isso por que eu sempre gostei de avatar,o desenho  claro!
screenjunkies Durante quando o narrador fala o Estrelando, d para perceber que ele no se segura, e comea rir! KKKKKKKKKK
screenjunkies 0:03 Are you looking for a Bing themed movie? The Amazing SpiderMan.
screenjunkies Gotta be when hal made the lance armstrong crack, then immediately reached for the computer, after Vaughn said he didnt wanna use google.
screenjunkies my something funny is do you smell that?I think its your mom.
screenjunkies It was obviously when he asked why Jennifer Aniston left Vince Vaughn. Because it obviously didnt happen the other way round.
screenjunkies The very second you said you were gonna use google to ask questions lol
screenjunkies screw you Hal, Im fourteen and I was looking forward to watching the Sixth Sense.
screenjunkies Must watchVince Vaughn Googles Himself!At the end they talk about the worst M. Night shamalamadingdong movie. Very funny.
screenjunkies I got spoiled by Lonely Island on Sixth Sense
screenjunkies I like Paul Walker better! But between those two muscles with feet...vin diesel
screenjunkies Hahaha, definitely not only that blonde guy now
screenjunkies I like both actors ,but The Rock dressing in a Pink Tutu !? The Rock wins because he can pull off a Pink Tutu and still be cool :)
screenjunkies The rock. At least he has some good movies and the occasional emotion. All vin diesel can do is whisper very intensely. That and the rock is a beast, vin is actually very short
screenjunkies MUST DO A HONEST TRAILER FOR THE PURGE..............NOWWWWWWWW
screenjunkies The rock was in wwe and could beat the other mans ass
screenjunkies Van dissel, the rock or heisanberg!!! Witch one!!
screenjunkies Looks like youre getting a screenjunkies tshirt.
screenjunkies Dude Patrick Stewart has not changed in like 30 years, He could still be Picard, Brent Spiner could still be Data. Not sure about anyone else, but those 2 yeah
screenjunkies For Dr. Crusher, I replace with Jewel Belair Staite.
screenjunkies How about making original movies for once?
screenjunkies I just wanna be Harry Mudd in a stolen alien spaceship, tooling around Fed Space with my girls. lol
screenjunkies That yellow shirt doesnt agree with him!
screenjunkies 24 still with Kiefer Southerland
screenjunkies Such bad choices for DATA man.Tom Cruise??? Haley Joel Osment??? Joseph GordenLevitt??? serious???There is only one Tom who can do Data.TOM HIDDLESTON. He looks just like Data.And is a great actor.
screenjunkies huge jackoff as picard ... you sir should be shot
screenjunkies Am I the only one that thinks if theyre going to reboot TNG, couldnt Patrick Stewart reprise his role? After all, seeing as theyre sort of in the same (but if thing turned out differently) universe, surely you would want them to look fairly similar (i.e. Zachary Quinto could be a younger Leonard Nimoy).The age factor doesnt really need consideration seeing as Patrick Stewart looks pretty much the same no as he did then.
screenjunkies Idris Elba for Worf :)
screenjunkies The reason he wouldnt want Denzel making a cameo is he isnt in bro love with him. Donald would be charming, Denzel would be out of place.
screenjunkies No cares if you unsubscribe (again). Let him make his video, he want to, enjoy yourself and shut the fuck up.
screenjunkies Lmfaoo at the Mariah Carey part
screenjunkies Well this guy is a jackass.
screenjunkies Well this guy is a jackass.
screenjunkies ...so..youre telling us to not funding by funding?
screenjunkies Man finally somebody gets the picture. all i see is all this hate when the campaign is more that what people are thinking it to be. I backed even though i knew it was going to fail.we ar not hating zach. Because zach braff is going to succeed, we are looking at hollywood using sites like kickstarter to fund projects thatovershadow people who are trying to fund their films that have neither the connections or money.
screenjunkies Funded from three sources when he has the money to back it himself. Im sorry but you know, when you come up with an idea for something and have the money, you should make it with your own money. I thought Kickstarter was more for folks who really couldnt go it alone. Zach just doesnt want to invest all his own money. But then You Tube used to be for the average folk but now its all corporate.
screenjunkies A Syrian Film wouldve been far more innapropriate!
screenjunkies Make her see The Human Centipede 2 :D
screenjunkies When you were going off to your mom about the valuable lesson that could be learned from this movie her reaction was like any good moms would be.
screenjunkies starship troopers when the shower scene showed boobs and i was watching with my parents
screenjunkies Hugs and kiss to your mom that was just too cute. My mom would not sit though that movie with me and it my favorite.
screenjunkies when i first heard the title human centipede first thing comes to mind is horror genre, a monster with a wierd mixture of human and a massive centipede. Then when my friends told me what its really about, shit goes down, i dont even know why i watched this video but im thankful of them that they blurred the im gonna lose it scenes
screenjunkies Game of Thrones! The part when Joffrey forced a hooker to spank another hooker was so awkward to watch with my mom.
screenjunkies When you were going off to your mom about the valuable lesson that could be learned from this movie her reaction was like any good moms would be.
screenjunkies Sad thing is, Pacific Rim was the best one and it made the least amount of money.
screenjunkies The Wolverine was waayyyy better than Man of Steel. And SpiderMan 3 suuucks.
screenjunkies After watching this, I wanted to see how close they were. At least Amy knows how to do her job.Kristian (610)Amy (810)Devin (610)Hal (710)1) Iron Man 3 (409)2) Despicable Me 2 (367)3) Man of Steel (291)4) Monsters University (268.5)5) Fast  Furious 6 (238.7)6) Star Trek Into Darkness (228.8)7) World War Z (202.4)8) The Heat (159.6)9) The Great Gatsby (144.8)10) The Conjuring (137.4)
screenjunkies Any chance that youll veer release extended versions of these videos? Id really love to see everyones full thoughts
screenjunkies I cant beleive that critics and other people said iron man 3 was the best iron man movie ever but it turns out to be another stupid film by marvel. Fuck it that movie was fuckin bad
screenjunkies The Lone Ranger was the biggest bomb of the year wasnt it?
screenjunkies The wolverine is gonna be better than man of steel maybe not more money but it kinda sucks
screenjunkies Man of steel at number one!!!
screenjunkies He means domestically. It still made over 200 million, but yeah. Lol
screenjunkies Nina Dobrev or Jennifer Lawrence
screenjunkies The look on Mark Wahlbergs face haha classic.
screenjunkies Dame Angela Lansbury. Now there is a smoking chick
screenjunkies Poor Mark Walhberg! But happy to see you met your fav. actor.
screenjunkies arnold schwarzenegger and chuck norris, hope i wrote arnolds last name correct.. i would absolutely pee myself.
screenjunkies Fantastic vid one of the kind Bravo Nick!!
screenjunkies If i met Arnold Swacheankfjdgkjn i would loose my shit! i would start quoting all the movies hes ever been in and i would probably get punched in the face.
screenjunkies I would meet Chuck Norris, then Vaporize from sheer awesome
screenjunkies I would flip out if I met Quentin Tarantino I am a HUGE fan if his work.
screenjunkies Muito bom e bem verdade...
screenjunkies faz skyfall e les miserables
screenjunkies CHOREI AQUI KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
screenjunkies ALAN, vei...kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk sem palavras fikei rindo disso o vdeo inteiro.
screenjunkies Arya Stark why because she is so amazing and a badass... And Daenarys because she has Dragons and huge huge army...
screenjunkies I like arya, shes a total badass, hate joffrey so much im glad hes dead!
screenjunkies Favorite character... If I had to chose... it would be Jon Snow... :D And the most annoying character... it supposed to be Joffrey or Theon... :D
screenjunkies Best character will always be Eddard StarkMost annoying character is Melisandra
screenjunkies Stannis for the Throne.
screenjunkies Where Are My Dragons!!
screenjunkies I love Ramsay cuz he fucked up Theon but they also make Theon look like a massive asshole in the show and he isnt nearly that bad in the books. I also love Arya and Dany in the books and Tyrion will always and forever be my favorite of all time.
screenjunkies fav characters: Daenerys, Littlefinger, The hound, Tyrion, arya and jon, Cersei, jofreyAnnoying charactershated: the redhaired btch(BOTH:behind the wall(jons gf) and infront the wall(the witch)), SANSA, bran(bron?) stark, margary
screenjunkies THE HOUND IS FUCKIN AWESOME!!! FUCK THA KING!!!
screenjunkies Check out this video on YouTube:
screenjunkies Whens the Donnie Darko fest?
screenjunkies Boondock saint fest!!!!!
screenjunkies Everytime Rick says stuff or things take a random household object, put it in a whiskey keg, and down it all
screenjunkies the blood of my enemies, watching... Dexter duh
screenjunkies Stay out off my territory
screenjunkies Drink a shot every time Batman does a Batman Squint.
screenjunkies demonblood of your enemies.... for supernatural ie whenever there is sexual tension between Castiel and Dean
screenjunkies I suggest getting a bottle of whiskey for when Stannis smiles a smile of joy (not sneer). When it happens you can sell that bottle and with the money travel to Crete, N. Ireland  Iceland. Or youd have passed away and your granchildren children can do it in your place
screenjunkies lol, fox news, blond women, jerk of. lold
screenjunkies Futurama, Each time bender says Ass drink a beer )
screenjunkies Every time someone says We have to go back! on LOST, take a shot of sacred, middle of the island, life water! Or whiskey.
screenjunkies You owe John Cho sex. LOL.
screenjunkies fandom day every fandom from otaku to whovein will be praised and given one thing from their respected choice from what ever series TV video games or otherwise
screenjunkies Trying to build an actual Death Star would be dumb, but making a space station in the shape of one would be hilarious.
screenjunkies WHAT THE FRACK!!! WHAT THE FRACK IS HE DOING!!! NOOOOOOOOO, TELL ME IT ISNT SO ITS IMPOSSIBLE
screenjunkies can you just SHUT UP!!!!!!!! HE DOESNT KNOW ANY BETTER YOU IDIOT!!!!!!! NOT EVERYONE IS A NERD!!!!!!!! 8(
screenjunkies Worf blew up the death star, hahaha.
screenjunkies Haha I cant argue with that. However, Google Force meld and click on the Wookieepedia link. The page lists 24 books that either include or reference a jedi mind meld. Theyre not the Thrawn series, but at least they say Star Wars on the cover.
screenjunkies 1.watch all my favourite 2.watch all the screen junkies videos 3.realise all my favourite films suck 4.then watch them again anyway
screenjunkies 2:26 Best stare ever XD
screenjunkies I cracked up at SKELETOR! :D
screenjunkies the climax was all a dream what a rip off lol.
screenjunkies THE STAIRS THE BEST PART
screenjunkies Yikes, that makes for awkward breastfeeding.
screenjunkies And Kristen Stewart . . . And her inability to use toothpaste Hahaha cant stop laughing
screenjunkies say SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY
screenjunkies Ron Burgundy.... wahahahahaha
screenjunkies Most of the time they just dont speak and stare awkward
screenjunkies 26mins of stares! No no no no humanity has not come to this
screenjunkies I went crazy after the first min. :(
screenjunkies I watched 10 seconds before skipping to the end and checking the stare total. Waaaaaaaaay too much staring
screenjunkies It could almost be a silent movie
screenjunkies seriously, how the fuck did these movies ever get made? i even had to invent a new word to describe their utter shitness as no existing word would do. that word is......dildge
screenjunkies I feel terribly sorry for the person who had to edit this.
screenjunkies Worst movie ever!! Why do they keep making sequels?! It sucks. Only idiots with nothing to do pay to see a film as horrid as that I guess maybe thats why they continue making them. Gosh, people spend your money on something more productive, like feeding a hobo or something.
screenjunkies Purge, seriously? Like... Seriously??
screenjunkies that was barbara STREISAND
screenjunkies NPH should just host everything.
screenjunkies The rock and the expendable
screenjunkies Barbara Walters? Try again lol.
screenjunkies I just think that he is not simply hilarious at all. He and his family guy is boring as hell.
screenjunkies Shit, never mind. I just heard him put the s at the end. Sorry.
screenjunkies it would be great if Robert Downey Jr, hosted the Oscars
screenjunkies Barbra Streisand not Walters
screenjunkies I want to see all of the XMen, SpiderMan, The Avengers, Deadpool, and I guess The Fantastic Four (the only Marvel groups that Im fully aware of) together for like 2 or 3 movies. But replace everyone in The Fantastic Four except for The Thing because I didnt like the actors they had in the original two movies... that and The Human Torch also being Captain America would be difficult in some scenes
screenjunkies Holy crap!! Deadpool, Spiderman, Daredevil, and Wolverine. I call it!
screenjunkies My ultimate team would be Spiderman, Wolverine, Deadpool, and CM Punk.
screenjunkies I want to see all marvel and dc heroes to team up and fight all their enemies together. That would be AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies i love that via a goofball comedybased comic book, dipshit bros know what fourth wall means.Stealth learning motherfuckers.
screenjunkies Deadpool, Iceman, Mr. Marvel, and Ghost Rider
screenjunkies I wanna see Space Ghost and Bird Man terminate Dick Dastardly
screenjunkies what Bryan Singer needs to fix is how the two timelines, that of First Class and the original trilogy, dont mesh at all. If you watch the original trilogy, there is absolutely NO sense that Mystique and Xavier spent the first 20 something sears of their lives basically as brother and sister, she poisons Ceribro (ignore the spelling) for gods sake!!! and thats just one example. They need to establish some kind of split in the continuity and create some kind of alternateuniverse type situation with the time travel aspect of DOFP.
screenjunkies i would love to see hulk join spiderman. peter trying to hide hulk from his aunt is to funny.
screenjunkies A younger Neo (Keanu Reeves) from the Matrix, and Bella (Kirsten Stewart) from Twilight, so they could stare at each other devoid of emotion for hours.
screenjunkies It hurt to watch these women...
screenjunkies Ellen Ripley and Captain America
screenjunkies Come on Hal, you and Haily were cute! Persue that!We want to see you get married in the future!
screenjunkies I love how they dont get the references lol
screenjunkies What if you asked questions too smart girls wth boobies not flat chested pretty faced dumb girls ??? YOU ARE KILLING ME WTH STEREOTYPES
screenjunkies I dont think I would ever want to be with someone who doesnt know star wars, peter gabriel and back to the future. Id rather spend it alone
screenjunkies those girls are fucking stupid, how could one of them not get the star wars reference right away?
screenjunkies MORGAN FREEMAN! Not performing, just narrating whats happening in the crowd
screenjunkies The one that was in spongebob would be great!
screenjunkies The best half time show would be 2 hours long sandwiched between 15 minutes of football.
screenjunkies Admirable, but what does this movie have to do with the Super Bowl Half Time Show?
screenjunkies Half Time show  William Shatner doing a Benny Hill type performance with all the cheerleaders.. :)
screenjunkies Nothing beats boobs if were talking super bowl. Dont lie, every man had one fantasy fulfilled that day.
screenjunkies Best HalfTime show ever: European Football
screenjunkies HOLY FUUUCK. That Robin chick was on that Conan Goes to a Halloween Store video. She seems so funny and CHARMing. Robin I know youre reading this, Im so in love with you
screenjunkies This could have been an insightful look into real peoples views on the portrayal of witches, but for some reason youve turned it into a predictable and unfunny piece of pretend journalism that continues to poke fun at them for no good reason.
screenjunkies Parking spot spelleverything everyone wants in life.
screenjunkies There are no witches in this, just an idiot interviewing a dopey ginger and two hambeasts
screenjunkies These people are full of shit.
screenjunkies The first spell was in greek. It meant: please give me a parking
screenjunkies 1:03 bitch that aint a spell, that is greek... If it was that easy id be fucking gandalf
screenjunkies The reason witches are made to look evil is because we have a horned god who somehow they connect with the devil and the casting of spells that they somehow connect with the devil, even though WE DONT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE DEVIL! I think there is a huge ignorance to the whole witch thing being bad and stuff, we are made to look ugly and evil .....like really? Wicca (no exactly the same thing) is also picked on like that (some do practice magic), we are a religion however small just cuz we dont go to church and have a set standard doesnt make us any less of a religion and I dont like the way we are portrayed.
screenjunkies So apparently, anyone living in Greece is speaking in a language used to conjure magic.What the fuck?
screenjunkies MY favorite way to kill a zombie is to use cheese wirepiano wire and cut the head off of the zombie while applying pressure on the back of its neck with your boot and then driving over the severed head.
screenjunkies I would splice the head of a great white shark on to my right arm and a laser machine gun hammer sword on the the other... Also when I sleep the shark keeps watch and eats zombies trying to sneak up on me (Awesome)... I enjoyed warm bodies, nice movie :D
screenjunkies I cant tell if hes honest in this interview or just bullshitting us.
screenjunkies my favoite way to kill a zombie: NUKE!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Its scary that I cant tell if this is fake or not.
screenjunkies Wow wolverine ever heard of wax??
screenjunkies best way to kill a zombie? easy. set them on fire and watch them run while on fire... bet that would be some show to see...
screenjunkies Best fucking interview EVER!!

screenjunkies I never thought I say this but I agree with Nick Mudy about Tyler Perry watching His movies are like taking a shit in your eyes and ice cream
screenjunkies You forgot After Earth
screenjunkies Amazing SpiderMan was Amazing
screenjunkies Nick Mundy is a lowfunctioning mentally disabled fuckface. Ruined it.
screenjunkies Twilight, let it die already.I still remember I got fooled my ex gf to watch the 1st twilight show.Got vamp and werewolf? Really....got excited .Definitely not underworld....
screenjunkies The Die Hard series ended with Die Harder.All the themes that made up the first two movies were removed in the third, and they couldnt even bring back any of the recurring cast members. Everything that comes after is just a Bruce Willis action movie where he also happens to be named John McClane.
screenjunkies I liked the 4th Die Hard, but the 5th was terrible.
screenjunkies No lie, I fell asleep during the middle of Die Hard 5
screenjunkies THAT FAT TWAT NEEDS TO DIE!
screenjunkies Die Hard: Electric Boogaloo Die Harder Than The Previous Die Hard Die Hardcules in New York Die Hard Boiled Egg
screenjunkies HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
screenjunkies That guy has some decent points but I think he is putting on an act to try and seem really outraged. And to be blunt, he is not that good of an actor. Sorry, and Im not trying to be a troll or mean etc. To steal a phrase Im just show him how to fix this video
screenjunkies Now THAT was funny! Maybe they should go total camp in the die hard 6 with all the cliches and call it Old Habits Die Hard I might actually go see that. I love satire.
screenjunkies make a video of How to FIX the Lone Ranger and R.I.P.D!
screenjunkies FUCK YOU HAL!!!!! YOU JUST RUINED THE END OF THE GRAY FOR ME!!! FUCK YOU!!!!!!

screenjunkies what a shame that HBO cancelled Luck but they could digitalize the horses
screenjunkies I liked the movie Prometheus:(
screenjunkies Ya I gotta agree I thought the last of it left a long time ago... you know after Battlefield Earth
screenjunkies John Travoltas dignity . . . amen to that.
screenjunkies DOWNLOAD LINK FOR THE SONG??
screenjunkies meh  I wouldnt blame Ridley completely for Prometheus  the visuals and set all looked awesome  he did his job, but that script was pinksocked butthole bad.
screenjunkies People say the same about Cloud Atlas, but I totally got that film too.

screenjunkies 0:37 Twilight is my hands down my favorite movie everHer grammar is just as bad as her taste in movies.
screenjunkies to be honest i just watched it because in the honest trailer they said we made an 11 yearold cry oo
screenjunkies I always say it is a must to dislike any twilight video even though they are from ur favorite YouTuber UNLESS their making fun of it
screenjunkies 1:34 that was so cute
screenjunkies Mickey says : Search your feelings, you know it to be true. Oh boy. LOL :D
screenjunkies Funny. Thought Sebastian was great.Starwars Jennifer Larregui Joanna Santiago
screenjunkies this is hilarious!!!!
screenjunkies Game of throne. You do a shot every time they say winter is coming, white walkers, a House saying or every time Geofrey pisses you off.
screenjunkies Sebastian and eore the Best
screenjunkies Take a shot everytime there is a gun shot on the walking dead
screenjunkies THANK YOU SOMEONE FINALLY AGREES! Just because there was a bunch of different superheroes, doesnt mean its like the BEST MMOOCCIIIVVVEE EEEVVVVVERRR.
screenjunkies fringe: whenever Walter mentions food you take a shot... whenever Walter makes Peter uncomfortable you take two shots... when you dont understand what the hell are they talking about... you take three shots...(thats for when you are drunk and you cure your drunkenness with more alcohol)
screenjunkies That was not a prank.That was........ummm...........boring.
screenjunkies If someone tried a jedi mind trick on me, I would probably do what they say just in honor of Star Wars, but these guys were jerks.
screenjunkies The woman probably like shoot I shoulda voted for mitt.
screenjunkies say you can replace your liver with iron man
screenjunkies Ive liked all theyre videos so far except this one.... this wasnt pranking this was being a public menace which quite frankly they should have been arrested for.
screenjunkies So fucking stupid. Pranks indeed..
screenjunkies No. fucking with random people is annoying. you can prank people and not annoy or piss them off. this is bottom of the barrel.
screenjunkies It was funny. Dont be tepid people Reply with disagreement if you are dank grey and moist Kind regards.
screenjunkies Well its a dog and theres a plane...
screenjunkies If this was real................
screenjunkies Oh no! Could it be...a dog?
screenjunkies You should do a trailer on World War Z...(Do it!!!!!)
screenjunkies Funny shit man youre hilarious keep em coming :)
screenjunkies I dont know if summoning Hitlers ghost with Hal Rudnik there would be such a good idea...
screenjunkies lol.. obviously is a sound of an animal.. is a cat
screenjunkies I think...that the spirits...are requesting a sequel.
screenjunkies 4:03.. What was she doing?
screenjunkies is it ok if i say that i hate this kid
screenjunkies o god can u please kill them even with fire if need be
screenjunkies I hate them so much those fat disgusting pigs
screenjunkies Her face makes me want to vomit
screenjunkies At least theyre happy.
screenjunkies this was funny as hell in a very wrong way but for the sake of preserving culture Ill thumb it down...
screenjunkies she reminds me of the ogres from the hobbit. i could also vividly picture her arguing with herself in the mirror over how to make sghetti n budder until the rising sun turns her to stone.
screenjunkies omg!!! Pulp Fiction reference Pretty fking far from it!  Marcellus Wallace
screenjunkies I am about to throw up!!!!

screenjunkies Hello Jovem Nerd? uhsuhasuhau
screenjunkies uma tecnologia to avanada que vc nem consegue ver kkkkkkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies Mas o Hulk aprendeu a se controlar do nada.
screenjunkies Muito bom, rachei aqui. Mas acho que no Hulk deveria ter colocado Eric Bana mesmo, que comeou a nova srie de filmes do Hulk. E foi bem.
screenjunkies a parte do hulk controlar aconteceu por que ele segurou aquele basto la durante a briga entre os avengers
screenjunkies O hulk pode controla sua raiva por que o banner se transformou e no foi obrigado a se transformar, ficando descontrolado por dio, raiva ou dor intensa (adrenalina sabe). Quem nunca leu hq faz essas perguntas mesmo.
screenjunkies Como eles se comunicavam sem os fones kkkkkk.
screenjunkies ...but soon, I was staring STRAIGHT INTO THE FACE... of pure, Albanian evil. Where are you from? Mexico.You have a talent for raising expectations, good sir.Dunno about your love life, though.
screenjunkies The MexicanAlbanian guy would be a perfect Saddam Hussein look alike!
screenjunkies Screen Junkies, what would we do without you?! XD
screenjunkies Wow. Dude what are you on. Glad they got you out of the dogo before anyone was hurt
screenjunkies Only decent part of this vid is Hal getting his ass handle by BJJ dude.
screenjunkies honest trailers do a honest trailer on taken!! :D
screenjunkies Umf. That instructor can throw me around :3 Where do I sign up for his class?!?!
screenjunkies This is pretty hilarious... I hadnt even thought of that connection. lawl.
screenjunkies I had no idea that was jgl in angels in the outfield!!!! This AND I found out that elijah wood was a kid in back to the future!!! Today is a memorable day.
screenjunkies Im hoping you have something better in mind than shooting me in the head?
screenjunkies This is from two movies, The Kid (2000) and Angels in the Outfield (1994) My job here is done
screenjunkies What a crazy coincidence, I saw that video too
screenjunkies Its parts of that and Angels in the Outfield.
screenjunkies Joseph Gordon was the kid from angels in the outfield, MIND BLOWN!!!
screenjunkies Make an honest trailer of mama
screenjunkies OH HEY LITTLE GIRL BROTHERS AND SISTERS FIGHT ALL THE TIME, ARE YOU AN ONLY CHILD?
screenjunkies I HATE the little girl. Beverley hills chiuahua is not nonfiction! someone put her in front of a history documentary and tell her now do you like nonfiction, baby breath?
screenjunkies and like james lee said beverly hills chihuahua 2 is FAKE
screenjunkies I hated that girl My favorite movies are scifi
screenjunkies The fucking little girl
screenjunkies WHat I didnt like was that excessiveness amount of the main song... like the avengers was finally happening and everyone was enjoyed by it. I give a 710 for this movie.
screenjunkies I Hated that little girl! :(
screenjunkies I know who else hates the avengers confused Matthew, and he also hated Lion King
screenjunkies THe little girl says she doesnt like fiction yet her favorite movie is a movie about talking dogs
screenjunkies We need an encore from DJ Flula
screenjunkies This is all sorts of awesome.
screenjunkies chewing gum during an interview... yeah
screenjunkies God, I need to meet Ed Helms one day. He just seems like a really fun guy ALL the time.
screenjunkies i hate you in your face with a stick
screenjunkies Maybe he just like him. Thats why hes asking.
screenjunkies Did you watch too much Sasha Baron Cohen?
screenjunkies 0:210:31 ahhhhahahaha!
screenjunkies Oh my god I love this XDDD I love Tim
screenjunkies yeah honestly I dont know a thing about taking magic mushrooms and I can tell without trying that its fake. They didnt even try at all.
screenjunkies haha these comments make me lol
screenjunkies If these guys didnt take mushrooms I would be concerned
screenjunkies Totes. UR GONNA DIE CLOWN!
screenjunkies why would you ever make the intro so loud and the interview so quiet
screenjunkies i live in the suburbs and my parents suck
screenjunkies hes not tripping, its a joke dude
screenjunkies What was the movie at 2:19?
screenjunkies Is that the music from the Transformers movie? You know, the part where everybodys favorite character dies?
screenjunkies 0:46 what movie is this?
screenjunkies Is it bad that I IMMEDIATELY recognized the song as Death of Optimus Prime? And I mean immediately.
screenjunkies what did Christian Bale say?
screenjunkies FREE DONE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies This really needs to show the names of the movies. Id love to watch a bunch of them.
screenjunkies They should do another one including the following films: Clive Owen in the Bourne Identity, Robert de Niro in Heat, Tom Cruise in Collateral, Leonardo di Caprio in the Departed, Jeremy Renner in The Town, Chow Yun Fat in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Sean Connery in the Untouchables, Rutger Hauer in Blade Runner, Stephen Baldwin in The Usual Suspects, Tom Berenger in Platoon, Alan Tudyk in Serenity. Just a suggestion.
screenjunkies i think it was the departed but im not fully sure
GameSack The woman standing there with a mic in her hand kind of ruins the effect...
GameSack Hilarious! More of this radio 1! Haha maybe be Starks turn!
GameSack Yet Nick Grimshaw is on in the morning, why ?
GameSack I love these two!! They are the best thing on radio, I adore their show, and radio 1 in general
GameSack Please change the intro its pain to my ears :(
GameSack Oh say can Yoshiiiii?
GameSack The same crap happens in team fortress 2 whiny pricks complain about weapons and then valve nerfs the weapons useless.
screenjunkies You know, its kinda right. Its all the F words, save for the fucks x3
screenjunkies FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
screenjunkies Please do Captain America: Winter Soldier!!
screenjunkies I see what you did there!
screenjunkies You could have just counted the actuals fucks in movie because now I dont give a fuck about this video
screenjunkies id really like to see star wars the clone wars as an honest tv trailer!
screenjunkies Have ur mom watch human centipede 2
screenjunkies The Iron Giant. I love cartoons and its nostalgic as all hell. the 50s atmosphere feels old but not dated. the bad guy isnt necessarily evil so much as getting caught up in his job and hes fun to watch. Hogarth is the perfect representation of a kid and what would happen if he came across a giant robot in that time period. And the animation is stunning.
screenjunkies Watch Were the World Mine or the short Fairies it was based on!
screenjunkies Watch Wolf on Wall Street wyour mom
screenjunkies Blues brothers!!!!!!!!!!!Oh yeah and forrest gump is amazing!
screenjunkies Terminater 2 judgment day 1991

screenjunkies say:SUPRISE! Motherfucker
screenjunkies Say : why do you wanna kill me!
screenjunkies say:Do you wanna build a snowman?
screenjunkies Say  the time has come, to punch the pineapple!
screenjunkies Do an honest trailer for the Lone Ranger!
screenjunkies Do a honest trailer of The Amazing SpiderMan 2 Rise of Electro xD
screenjunkies Say, I hope you get attacked by a group of epileptic dolphins.
screenjunkies Make it Pacific Rim meets Independence Day??I dont know about other people, but I thought Independence Day was a horrid movie. Well, maybe not when it was released, but watch it now, its the cheesiest, most nonsensical piece of shit.Ok, bye
screenjunkies Best Way To ReDo Transformers. Make It G1 Acurate And Continue Fakking G1 before It Became Holy Robot Head And Guns Jpanese Shit
screenjunkies So no more hot chicks cause i always thought those were great.
screenjunkies TF gonna be fixed when we learn to get organized and not to go to crappy movies.
screenjunkies I dont know what those words are. LOL
screenjunkies we havent got a trailer for it yet in britan
screenjunkies Nick, you are so fuxking right
screenjunkies Pacific Rim tried to be Independence Day and it didnt work, other than that I agree for the most part!
screenjunkies my advice. Dump all humans from the script. This is a TRANSFORMERS movie, in it humans dont deserve storylines, they dont deserve spotlight ... Cameos are good enoth for them!I dont care about that chop shop bostan dad and i bet he is gona be in 50 of the screentime. Ok no problem i can take that crap, but it have to have at least 90 screentime with actual Transformers taking part of the scene, that are not just siting around for decoration.In the end Transformers is about one race of alliens fighting some other race of aliens, and as a coincidence thats taking place around and on Earth.
screenjunkies The ending of The Mist is surprisingly meaningful, given that the movie sucks for most parts.
screenjunkies Plot twist Kevin Spacey is in all of them.
screenjunkies Nooooo, ive been spoiled.........wait. Ive already seen these movies.....?
screenjunkies Spoiled so many movies.. Why did i watch this :(
screenjunkies Darth Vader was Luke father? wtf
screenjunkies Arlington Road,the movie that made me even more paranoid about people than I already was,still is one of my all time favourites
screenjunkies Anything with Arya Stark and the Hound (They are the Game of Thrones Big Daddy and Kickass Girl) ... And, Daenarys with her Dragons...
screenjunkies Half of those you mentioned to be still alive are probably dead in the upcoming book already.
screenjunkies why is there a doll of Kanye West in the top left corner
screenjunkies 04:13 slays me every time.
screenjunkies Geoffrey is a bastard. his parents were not married. :)
screenjunkies I like this guy, hes like Andy Dick, but worse.
screenjunkies the best part: Arya and the faceless man
screenjunkies King Joffery is a literal bastard BTW, as he is product of incest.
screenjunkies You know nothin Jon snow
screenjunkies Know all the characters that it said no one knew
screenjunkies Say: Dude, you totally just got Sven Faced!
screenjunkies Meet unforgettable heroes....who where still alive when we wrote this trailer.So true, so true. If GoT were a Bmovie and you would take all the dundunDUNN out it would only be as long as the commercials.
screenjunkies do one for how I met your mothers, now that is over...
screenjunkies How about doing honest trailer for friends?!
screenjunkies Please say, I am the pretty pretty princess!
screenjunkies Tyrion Lannister a character so awesome lol so true though
screenjunkies It looks awful!...and i think thats the way i like it. This is what i thought about Transformers too back then when i first saw its Teasers.
screenjunkies So Shredder is old as fuck, the turtles look hideous, and were supposed to be excited for this, because... its Michael Bay? Gives look of disappointed parent
screenjunkies Megan Fox...Please....get away from my childhood.....
screenjunkies God damn it, am going to kep asking till you do it! Do Expendables 1  2. And say: Hey ho silver, AWAAEAEAAEAEYYY...
screenjunkies All movies of micheal bay is like transformers... and the island... please... no more micheal bay movies...
screenjunkies I like this because it seems based on the comic books that came out before the 1987 show. This brings me to another point the turtles were ruined by that show in the 80s. That stupid show already had its movie trilogy in the 90s. No its time for the comic books2003 show to get a movie, and whether you like it or not this is it. So quit bitching!!!
screenjunkies But why do the turtles look so freaky. Theyve got a big nose and lips. Like some sort of weird turtlehuman inbreeding experiment gone wrong. Totally ugly
screenjunkies is Leonardo going to finally cut someones head off with those swords?So lame to have a weapon that you cant really use.
screenjunkies I am hoping that this movie is good, I just cannot stress enough just how miscast April ONeil is. Not saying Miss Fox is or is not bad at acting, just saying that she is completely wrong for the part. Casting is not as simple as going to your standby eye candy and throwing a yellow coat on her and putting a camera in her hand.
screenjunkies I noticed the overuse of switches and levers too! Hahahaha!
screenjunkies The Winter Spoiler :P
screenjunkies Captain AMERICA the winter soldier. Pls pls!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies NO DO TRUE BLOOD OMFG
screenjunkies You are right... There is somthing with your voise but i dont know what
screenjunkies please do Captain America : The Winter Soldier!
screenjunkies DO AMERICAN PSYCHO!!!!
screenjunkies Just in time by one day
screenjunkies Gremlins  when the mother fights the evil gremlins she put one in the microwave and one in the blender.  I saw that in the theater when i was 9.
screenjunkies Only god forgives was pretty fucked up as a whole. The rape scene in girl with the dragon tattoo is pretty fucked.
screenjunkies like half of Snowtown!
screenjunkies Tongue cut and tooth rip. OLD BOY.
screenjunkies X is for XXL from ABCs of death. that or F, or Z from that same film.
screenjunkies Oldboy when the final twist is revealed is so fucked up
screenjunkies For me its gotta be that scene in Hannibal where Hannibal feeds Krendler (Ray Liotta) his own brain.
screenjunkies I was really surprised they mentioned Ichi the killer, and I think the most fucked scene is that whole movie. A guy who keeps his mouth together with piercings and gets off on pain, a girl getting her nipples cut off, the one dude having all those nails driven into his skull and then being left in the street. And the one scene where the old man just crushes a guy into almost nothing!The movie just gets worse and worse as you go man
screenjunkies Salo and Irreversible are definitely at the top for f up scenes. Eyes Without A Face and Sisters has always stuck with me.
screenjunkies Honest Action  All The Marvel Movies(the one that tie in with the avengers)Do it!
screenjunkies I like this shit. this is new to me, thanks!! it is very informative and realistic. DO STAR TREK (anything) OR INDIANA JONES!!!!!
screenjunkies I dont know your doc but Im sure I woulndt want to be one of hisher patient ...
screenjunkies This is awesome! Do Indiana Jones next!!! Especially number 4!!!
screenjunkies you should do a follow up series where they talk about how long it would take to recover in relation to what happens in the story of the movie
screenjunkies the expendables, lets see who lives.also iron man. bet you mr. stark is going to have a higher body count than the expendable mercs.
screenjunkies well lets just say john mcclane became invincible during die hard 4 and 5
screenjunkies Wreck it Ralph is the best video game movie HANDS DOWN!!!
screenjunkies Id like to see Viewtiful Joe made into a movie. I mean, it IS a video game about movies. Itd be neat.
screenjunkies Far Cry 3 as a movie would be great. The story really turns the whole sorry about colonialism subgenre on its side i.e. Avatar, Dances with Wolves, The Last Samurai etc. It could undo the disaster that is the Uwe Boll Far Cry film.
screenjunkies Legend of Zelda  Ocarina of time
screenjunkies I want a assassins creed movie.
screenjunkies I dont think were ever going to get a perfect video game movie. Video games are fantastic because of the interactions between the game and the player. the events are scripted yet entirely spontaneous at the same time. I just dont think any linear plotted film is ever going to live up to the multidimensional appeal of a video game. Even a simple film like Doom didnt do justice to the simple concept of the game by ID, which was essentially the granddaddy of the FPS genre. Now that most games are so involved, I just dont think you could ever cover everything within the span of a film, even if that film is Return of the King long, and still keep your audience entertained.
screenjunkies Hands down Halo would make an epic movie, even without master chief
screenjunkies I dont want to see an Assassins Creed movie, but now that its going to happen I hope is at least good and that Ubisoft doesnt focus on the games main characters and uses the oportunity to expand the AC universe with new characters while focusing on the main story line
screenjunkies How about DIVERGENT? :DDD
screenjunkies Since when are trailers 4 minutes long?
screenjunkies The cold never bothered me anyway.
screenjunkies Does anybody know the name of the sound effect that is always heard in the intro? (and where can it found if possible?) I cannot find anywhere! Thank you so much in advanced
screenjunkies Frozens actually not a bad movie this is a parody dont take it too seriously
screenjunkies I STILL READ IT!The cold never bothered me anyway!
screenjunkies Aqualad from Teen Titans!
screenjunkies I will be laughing if I saw scary movie 4 i could just imagine saw xD or haunted house!
screenjunkies say: PIP PIP DEDOODLY DOO
screenjunkies This is so true! How could I have missed this info before! Now it made the movie feels weird.
screenjunkies also DO DIVERGENT!!! Plzzzzz
screenjunkies i lost it at baby thor hahaha
screenjunkies no one pls just no more oscars pls
screenjunkies I want Leonardo DiCaprio to host
screenjunkies Cant believe he didnt mention Leo! Not even once!
screenjunkies I took everything Harrison Ford said sarcastically as thats what his eyes said.Jim Carrey to host the oscars that would be terryfying but brilliant! xD
screenjunkies Jim Carrey should host.
screenjunkies I think Ellen is pretty funny at times but yeah. The one Oscar moment I will never forget is the one in 2008 where Hugh Jackman was hosting and he did that funny movie song and he brought Anne Hathaway up on stage and they were singing and about the different movies and Anne sang her heart out and was totally hilarious. Hugh jackman is Awesome too! So I loved this video. End of rant..
screenjunkies please , let Ricky Jervais host the next time , he is awseom .
screenjunkies Miley and katy nd lady gaga and riahna and and that imperonater for liza manelly
screenjunkies No Polish commercials? Not even the Kevin Spacey ones!?
screenjunkies Morgan Freeman in an old spice commercial. Nothing else needs to be said.
screenjunkies Richard Attenborough doing a commercial for DIY vajazzling kits spoken completely in Esperanto. Complete with artfully done but intermittent shots of Mandy Patinkin yodelling in a gully (literal, not figurative).
screenjunkies Go check Hugh Jackman in Micromax India ad. Its surprisingly good.
screenjunkies Ive got to respect countries that allow drinking in their commercials. Americans dont let that happen.Meryl Streep selling Viagra in Sweden...
screenjunkies Seriously, Tommy Lee Jones and BOSS Drinks. He is a friggin alien!

screenjunkies oh my god marvel is making a film about a raccoon and we cant even do wonder woman
screenjunkies I think its gonna be great but it looks a little confusing at this point and is a little too jokey for what people will be expecting from a movie like this.
screenjunkies did I just watch an ad for your channel in your channel?
screenjunkies Do you guys have a arc of the covenant

retrogametech Nice fix! Glad to see another video from you.
retrogametech Its cool that the fuse is built into the plug, they arent as accessible in most of the systems Im familiar with.
retrogametech Crazy good deal you got there man, Love seeing the consoles being saved from being parted out for no reason.
retrogametech Wow that is amazing dude. Congrats
retrogametech wow you got really lucky there martin
retrogametech That is a great find, a very cool old console. Im not a collector of this stuff, but watching videos of the Vectrex in the past made me look on eBay to see how much they go for. The answer is a lot so that was a great price you got it for!
retrogametech Speaking of Vectrex controllers, you might enjoy this little DIY project. Seems to be catching up among Vectrex enthusiasts, given the original light pen is crazy expensive, as is.  bitly1iHY71g
retrogametech Awesome find. Even better, you didnt have to do anything remotely technical to get it up. I was worried the crt was faulty. Glad it was just a neutral lead. lucky score!
retrogametech I love your videos and your voice!
retrogametech Awww man blue balls are the worst!
retrogametech NO WAY!!! Im Literally rendering a video in adobe of opening three of these right now....like this vid though dude!
retrogametech Unballing. Welcome back.
retrogametech Stop playing with your balls!!(realizes there are others reading this comment and blows a kiss to all of them)Goodnight everybody! (Hint: its an Animaniacs reference of sorts)
retrogametech Great video man! I was just thinking about doing a review on my channel of this full set  and saw that you beat me to the punch, lol. Great pickups man! Such a cool little set. Keep up the great videos!
retrogametech How are you able to find so many AGS101 SPs so easily? Ive had a look for a while, and I cant find many good deals.Either that, or where do you find your 101 screens? My SP 001 has 3 dead pixels, so I wanted to find a new one.Also, my DS lite has a damaged touch screen. It works fine, but its heavily scratched. Ive seen new digitizers for it thats really cheap is that all I need? Or is it something worse than that? If it requires a lot of solder work and stuff, then dont worry, I can live with it. I think I got it a year after it launched, so 2007. (hinge still works great, and apart from some scratches (back, front, touch screen overlay, and two deep scratches on the battery cover, its in great condition!)
retrogametech So, have you found that Gamebox DS yet?
retrogametech Man, Gameboy Color still looks sexy till this day, I want one :(
retrogametech Great video mate, nice to see you back :)
retrogametech Wow thats a great collection of handhelds. I must get the Gameboy advance my kids had one back in the day but not a mod one. Great vid mate.
retrogametech Nice to see you back Martin. :)
retrogametech Glad to see youre able to make some new videos! You got me into collecting more games and I enjoy seeing the new stuff you pick up. Let me know if you ever want to trade from someone in the US.
retrogametech I like the glacier original GBA very much! It is a solid and beaitiful thing and mine is mint! I only play it in summer I wonder why!! I would like to mod it some day like yours I dont like the SP as much.
retrogametech glad to see you back man, ive missed your videos.Cant wait till you do the gba shoulder button mod! been trying to do some mods myself and thats something i would definitely like to do as well.
retrogametech Intresting, I like videos about retro collections:)
retrogametech ah you found the software great :)
retrogametech Cool. I was thinking about a side project to do one day, hacking into a GBA, and replacing the insides with Android hardware, to have an ultra emulator with other functions, I have a DS with emulators but its the original and its not sleek or small.
retrogametech Does dumps piratebootleg games?
retrogametech Glad you got it working! Id be pretty interesting in this for backing up save files! My sis accidentally deleted my save of Sonic Battle years ago, so I just let her use my cart, but since then shes gotten her own. Would love to copy her save back to hers and start over again. :)Does GBWriter support dumping GBC and GB saves as well?
retrogametech This may be immature, but i laughed every time you said dump
retrogametech Theres a very similar item currently on eBay here: http:www.ebay.co.ukitmEZFLASHII512MbForGBAGBASP161143074189?ptUKChargersDockshashitem2584e02d8dlooks like a different version of the same item. But its boxed, so it could well come with a software disc.
retrogametech Ive been watching your channel for wile now and really enjoy your content i also know your probably the best person i should be asking this to.I really want to get my original gameboy fitted with a back light and new top screen, ive looked into doing this myself but it looks far to complicated for me i would end up breaking it :) now i know you did a video a wile ago showing how to do this yourself but i was wondering do you know of anywhere or anyone i could send mine to? ive looked everywhere and cant find anyone offering to this.I know its a long shot but figured if anyone would know you would.Take care
retrogametech This site references several smart cards and custom made stuff. I didnt see that specific card, but maybe you could find it looking for related cards?http:www.reinerziegler.deGBAgba.htm
retrogametech You wont believe this, but I actually have one of those in here somewhere. Ill look it out and see if the disc is in with it.
retrogametech Have you ever had any experience with an R4i Card for the 3ds, Im looking into buying one, any opinions?
retrogametech i want one of the gba flash carts really bad
retrogametech I have a super card mini sd for my gba it works pretty well no real software needed really just pop in roms and play. Only supports up to 2gb though. But its kinda hard to find now I think cause the website I got it from sold out already. Should check it out. Its clear purple and has a cool storm trooper picture on it.
retrogametech Nvm Im dumb. I just realized you already did that
retrogametech Yeah Martin, That is Korean.
retrogametech The language is Korean I think seeing some of the symbols before on noodles and stuff.
retrogametech Ive been on a game boy kick also! i just got gunstar super heroes in the mail today :D. love your channel!
retrogametech I never get tired of GBA. I play mine more than my DS.
retrogametech Do you have any of the pirate multi carts for the GBA? I have a few of them in my collection, kinda obsessed with bootleg stuff. Would be good to see a video if you have any.
retrogametech Seems to be the case for quite a few games on the system. AstroBoy, Lady Sia and Santa C Jr are a few others that usually get overlooked.
retrogametech Hey Rob! This is one of the first Lego games Ive played and I was pleasantly surprised :) . Ill be keeping an eye out for others.
retrogametech Cool, well Im already working on it so hopefully you wont have to wait too long. :)
retrogametech Cool, Ill check out that Madagascar Penguins game. Mostly just Pokemon on the GBA for you then Im guessing? haha
retrogametech ooh didnt even know micro machines was on GBA.. i bet that feels perfect for a handheld game great selection of games here.. good ole GBA :)
retrogametech Only recently started on GBA stuff after a 20 year obsession with the DMGs will have to keep my eye out for those CT games, they look pretty cool.
retrogametech Nice setup. SMS in the centre :) A year ago I had: PS3 80 GB, PS3 super slim, Dreamcast  lightgun (needs CRTscreen), Megadrive 1, Megadrive 2  SMSadapter, NES  turbo joystick, Wii black and a Gaming PC. It was all hooked up to a Samsung 37 HD. I was thinking about getting a scanline generator for retro feeling. I sold almost everything when I moved. I kept the wii for my son. Now Im using apps on the wii until I can afford a PS4. Do you have a goal for your setup?
retrogametech Nice set up! Thanx for the vids
retrogametech oh cool you mail ordered some game systems from America.. nice start.
retrogametech See previous comment )
retrogametech They have TONS of them! :P
retrogametech Very organized! I wish I had the time and patience to make my setup look like that.
retrogametech One is a promo preorder bonus. Its not a game. :)
retrogametech I only have a 3 HDDVDs for my 360 addon drive, but all 3 are better than their bluray counterparts. I have The Thing, The Big Lebowski  Apollo 13 which all have varying levels DNR on the blurays but the HDDVDs have a nice natural look to them. Its a recent acquisition, got the drive and the discs from CeX online, I may pick up some more HDDVDs but dont want too many in case the drive fails plus its a bit noisy. Any way to boost audio levels from 360 audio adapter output to headphones?
retrogametech Gotta love the Master System out front. ()
retrogametech Oh OK...I thought the Lancers always had a chainsaw, learn something every day er? :)
retrogametech Most obscure in my collection? Hmmm...does Monster Rancher count?
retrogametech Thanks. Its been fun watching these TTT responses.
retrogametech lol now these are some really obscure items martin xD
retrogametech I spent a few minutes on eBay and found the seller. Then I decided I didnt really want such a huge box just to play not really virtua fighter. Now if I could find a complete Naomi for 25 quid... )
retrogametech Yeah its a real shame more games werent made for it. I think it could have been great. Im more of a hardware collector so the lack of games doesnt bother me too much. But Beast Busters 2nd looks like the game to have! Sadly it uses its own specific board and is very rare, desirable  expensive.
retrogametech Anyone else hearing how Joe sounds a LOT like Link during that demo fight?
retrogametech Saw the hyper 64 on cgr.
retrogametech wow thats a real bargain martin ) i just saw one guy on ebay.de who wanted 1500 for a hyper neogeo 64 board with 3 games i think, wich is way too much i like te hardware aswell but it is so huge and there are not alot of games available for it so i just stick to my oneslot i think :D
retrogametech check my rare console that i found on dumpster. nice vid btw
retrogametech Oh no. the arcade bug has bitten you too :D
retrogametech Cool. Have you bought many games for it? Wild Ambition is very cheap but the others seem a bit expensive. Ive had my eye on these for a while. Thought Id better get one now while theyre still affordable and available :).
retrogametech Just keep trawling ebay and eventually youll find something interesting :P
retrogametech Whats the name of the tool to open the 360 controler?
retrogametech I cant quite place your accent, but I love it.
retrogametech you go girl! wait, wrong salutation...
retrogametech That little bastard still catches me out every now and then! :P
retrogametech Great work Martin..:)
retrogametech Thank you so much for the cool video, as always. Id need the connect button microswitch, I broke it some time ago and now I cant connect my controller on the pc and its annoying. Do you know where can I get one online? If you do have a spare one I can pay you the switch and the shipping to Italy! Thanks.
retrogametech I just cleaned my controller the other day the hidden screw behind the security sticker caught me out XD
retrogametech Thanks for watching and commenting :)
retrogametech Sega genesis was more popular in Russia, because it was cheaper than SNES.
retrogametech Funny, there are Nintendo clones all over the place here, but I never see Sega clones. When I would browse mercado livre in Brazil there are many for sale there, and they are all called Mega Drive. Very interesting hardware for sale there. Great review, love seeing the insides of odd electronics.
retrogametech This is that we really had in Russia. We also had a terrible clone of NES or Famicom called Dendy. Games were great  most of them were Japanese, copyrights were cut out, some games were copied unproperly, which made them impossible to complete.
retrogametech I would rather say Kahkh Dehlah, because it sound more like real Russian would say it.
retrogametech Yay another Scottish techie YouTuber
retrogametech System on chip? Booo! Hisss!
retrogametech I dont know why that is. It might be because Sega never officially released or distributed the console in your region? Piracy and bootlegs seem to be most common in countries where the official product is hard to find or overpriced.
retrogametech poor imbalanced console :D
retrogametech Thats dicing with death :P
retrogametech Where do you keep your games?
retrogametech Those Sky boxes suffer from bad caps. If it powers up at all its likely just the caps faulty. HDD can be replaced with another SATA drive. Or you can just strip it down for spares as you suggest )
retrogametech I dont have a games room. But I do have some videos of my gaming setup on my channels main page :)
retrogametech I enjoy the odd random video. I find it much easier to make videos while my kids are in school and going to bed earlier.
retrogametech Quality over quantity :)
retrogametech Yeah i agree, Whenever im off from school so now in the summer, non of my 300 people that i am subbed too hardly upload
retrogametech Ive been needing a new HDD for ages and after watching this I remembered I used to have Sky so Ive since took it apart and stuck the HDD in my PC. Thanks a lot for bringing this to light, even though its obvious I wouldnt have thought of it.
retrogametech Well, a ramble is better than nothing! I see those sky boxes all the time and never think to harvest them for parts. Just goes to show, never throw anything out. Great work, keep it up!
retrogametech what an awesome find, I applaud you on that. I saw a similar HDD on Amazon for around 60 bucks.
retrogametech i have the same kinda aqua blue tealish GBC. it was a gift from my brother. it needs alot of cleaning. still works though. but it was a gift from my bro (along with Mega Man: Dr. Wilys Revenge) so im not reselling it any time soon.
retrogametech Hey man, love the channel, keep it up. Hope to see a new video soon.
retrogametech Cheers! Not bad huh? :)
retrogametech 49.5p for ico. WOW. Another great video thanks
retrogametech I watched some comparison vids on the original VS remake of Ico. Youre definitely much better off with the PS3 version. I might try and hunt down the HD version instead. Ico seems like a pretty chilled out game. Not tried Shadow yet. You cant complain getting them free on PS :)
retrogametech Surprisingly Guitar Hero: On Tour Decades is a good game.
retrogametech Ico for 50p! What a deal!
retrogametech I never knew they even existed until recently!
retrogametech Thank you. Im glad you like them!
retrogametech I saw your video some time ago and found it very interesting. Today I finally got myself an AGS101 second hand (Im in New Zealand) and mine is similar to yours (Pearl Blue with Aus code) but has some extra writing underneath Use only AGS002 which says Production Year: 2007 and also has a slightly different code: CAGTAUS(E4)2. Curious!
retrogametech Ive seen a few backlit Aussie SPs on Ebay but they dont show up very often at all. Best bet is still the US model.
retrogametech we have the model 101 in canada too :)
retrogametech I want an AGS 101. One day maybe :)
retrogametech im not sure why you find this so weird this was the normal console for kids in my day (yes in Australia)
retrogametech I thought they all had a light plus all the newr ones just added another brightness
retrogametech Love the vids, keep up the great work
retrogametech Ive done a few vids on my setup in the past if youre interested :) . The main unit has a Bravia with SLG3000 for the retro gear. MVS gets hooked up to a Trinitron. I test all my repairs on the Bravia.
retrogametech Haha, that faulty Mega Drive from the shed has now fixed and helped me mod so many other systems. Good old SEGA! XD Thanks for watching and commenting :)
retrogametech Nice work mate! I did a similar fix on a damage AES I received a while ago and I still own it! Works a treat! :) btw you dont happen to be on the bordersdown forums do you?
retrogametech I saw your AES on ebay and must admit being tempted cos I know youd have done a quality job fixing it up.
retrogametech I still have mine that doesnt work lol.
retrogametech Exactly what I though when I found out about it.
retrogametech btw, you can do that trick by holding either start or select you dont have to hold both. And whats more is that on the 3DS XL, the 1:1 screen is the same physical size as a gameboy color! I put mine up to it to be sure! So with the 1:1 pixel ratio and at that size, it really is like looking at my actual GBC, but with a backlight. Also, I just have to know where did you get that flash cart thats in the GBA SP? If it can run Shantae perfectly, I would love to have one!
retrogametech I used to own a gameboy color and a few others but I discontinued them
retrogametech Thats cool. I did not know that. it makes the game rather small though unless you have the 3DS with the larger top screen which sadly I do not. :( But its rather neat!
retrogametech Cheers. I only really buy from within the UKEurope so I dont get hit with any custom charges etc. I try to avoid selling on ebay these days due to high fees and zero support for sellers if things go wrong.
retrogametech I knew about the DS native resolution trick, but I had no idea you could also do it on the virtual console games. I imagine on a 3DSXL it would be a slightly better experience with the bigger screen.
retrogametech So cool Nintendo included that hidden feature in 3DS :)
retrogametech Im guessing we can not get the Tinkerbat transformation in the 3DS Version huh?
retrogametech You try grounding the 32x on the ground spots? I know mine would have issues if I didnt install the gound plates that came with the 32x.
retrogametech Another interesting video, i thought you wasnt going to modify that little piece of unusual gaming historical memorabilia? Im glad for the attempts though! Always a pleasure to watch these videos! I still cant believe Beaties sold that though! I remember going into it moderately often when I was young, never saw that though :(
retrogametech I havent, no. Id guess he only dealt with translating the instructions to English for the company who made the console.
retrogametech Not to sound dumb but it might be the fact that the system itself was intended to play at 50hz so thats why the 32x had complications. But what do i know.
retrogametech Haha, get used to it :P
retrogametech Ahh! Too bad on that man. Interesting enough that it does somewhat play though. Well at least you own one of these in box :) Gary Smoke might be able to help in dot points lol awesome vid!
retrogametech I love your accent.. I love how you say console. Consoooo haha Love your videos.
retrogametech Aye, exactly what I was thinking!..... Wait, what?
retrogametech Suggestions: Sin  Punishment is a cant miss game. Mad World is another great game, Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World is pretty good for an RPG. Deadly Creatures isnt too bad either...Billy Bob Thornton and Dennis Hopper do the voice acting in it.I can also tell you a game not to get....Alone in the Dark. I dont care what anyone says about broken controls in a game, the driving controls in this game are the worst in gaming. Dont believe me, play the game and judge for yourself. In this game, you literally have to luck your way through a level. Youll spend hours wrecking a car that only response to you about 25 of the time, only to completely skip over a whole level at the end...yes that broken of a game...
retrogametech Got ps3 but I still love my wii. You should get xenoblade, its the best game for wii. I also love call of duty 4 for wii
retrogametech Sonic Colours is pretty great if you havent already played it, not exactly a hidden gem but it certainly gets my recommendation.
retrogametech I have been currently playing Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of The Moon, and tbh seriously enjoying it. Also, take a look at No More Heroes 1 and 2 :D RedSteel 2 is also great but you will want the motion plus adapter for that one. If you want some difficult and very strange retro gameplay take a look at bit.trip complete. I have been doing the same, cruising the 2nd hand shops and picking up wii games for 15 dollars :) Perfect time to start collecting for the console :D
retrogametech Try and pick up Disaster Day of Crisis  its really good..and can be picked up for a few quid. another great video
retrogametech Yes, before Nintendo started incorporating Wii MotionPlus into the Wiimote, it came as a separate sensor attachment that clips onto the controller.
retrogametech Ive been on the look out for Sin and Punishment for a while :) . Its not so easy to find in the wild and goes for quite a lot on ebay. It looks really good. Cheers for the suggestions!
retrogametech red steel 2 is amazing
retrogametech Ive heard thats good. Will put it on the list. Cheers! :)
retrogametech Tis quite nice, but since Ive got a R4 card for my DS I wont be needing one any time soon.Although, its interesting that it can play MP3s with, I assume, its built in sound chip.
retrogametech Is it pretty much an MP3 player that just borrows the GBA battery, controls and LCD for its UI? Also I never even knew my 3DS could play music, pretty cool!!
retrogametech Haha, thats a kinda neat addon.
retrogametech Moonshl is just one of the folders on that SD card. Same card I use in my R4.
retrogametech Pretty awesome dude. Would love to get a hold of one of these. Its just pants that the nearest HMV these days is Glasgow or Edinburgh, and probably not likely to find one now
retrogametech A great little novelty for 98p:)
retrogametech I just used the card from my R4. )
retrogametech Yeah the AES. awesome!!! thanks man
retrogametech Would it work with the Gamecubes GBA player?
retrogametech it was maid in taiwan
retrogametech Sadly theres no details on what was done to achieve compatibility. Ive got mine partially compatible but I think I might need to switch out the Xtal or find a NTSC 32X.
retrogametech Thanks for watching and taking the time to comment! :) I find the bootleg and clone systems interesting, too.
retrogametech It crazy to think that it was even cheaper than the real deal!
retrogametech The sega 32X compatibility fix with this clone has been done, can be seen here: vKbW2pN6mk
retrogametech also wonder if the jumper wire has anything to do with it being stuck in 50hz
retrogametech Haha, no worries. Its definitely nice to see a higher quality bootleg for a change! :)
retrogametech where did you find that cool clone
retrogametech Very likely the same guy. All the other bits included with the console are marked as manufactured in Taiwan. He probably workedworks as a translator and proofreader as well. Maybe Ill drop him a PM to see if he remembers.
retrogametech I would buy one off u if you where able to give us a price iv been looking all over eBay for a project and I cant find any
retrogametech This is awesome. How much do you think you can get for them?
retrogametech thats fuckin terrible about the broken box. and its got fragile stickers on and everything! man, they put their prices up, take the piss, then treat packages like shit.. GRRRR!! dude, you are a tech legend. what a result.
retrogametech super jelous. but very happy for tyou!
retrogametech lol, yes i would. let me know when you want got get rid of them and the price you want. would love to take one of these bad boys of ya hands.
retrogametech Not sure. But once theyre fully functional again they should be worth a lot more than what I paid. Theyll be a bare bones unitreplacement board.
retrogametech Well Id hope youd be willing to pay a bit more than just the postage! haha :P
retrogametech Great job, man! Its always good to know that another original SNK beast was saved from the death!
retrogametech Is there anything I could use in place of the VGA scaler for a Good antialiasing effect? Like a HDMI transcoder or something?
retrogametech I dont understand if you have the same option setup any chance of doing a small video to help me as yours might be a different option set up to mine then i can follow your video step by step then i will reply if i see anything different in my options compared to yours.
retrogametech Why tell me to fuck off I meant!
retrogametech As your TV has LAN input the secret door might be the door to the Tron World! Or simply CR2032 battery backup for the clock?
retrogametech Your setup is so perfectly put together. I plan on using a similar model when I move in a bit to get my wires under control and properly tied off. :)
retrogametech he must have explained himself in all of his videos talking about scan lines... fuck off and look for yourself.
retrogametech Theres no point in putting the Dreamcast through the scaler. It outputs a very nice 480p VGA signal natively so putting it through extra hardware would just end up degrading the image.
retrogametech Just the confusion that will now ensue most of the time nowadays lolol
retrogametech No, the only systems in my setup that benefit from that particular scaler and SLG are the Wii and Dreamcast. The rest I prefer TO directly hookup via RGB SCART :) . Maybe if I had something like an XRGBMini but I doubt Id invest that much money into one piece of hardware :P
retrogametech What is the television stand you have?
retrogametech Haha, Im done with the challenges for now :P . Not too familiar with old Ataris so not sure what to suggest.
retrogametech If I had to guess he probably likes putting things together, he seems handy with tools.
retrogametech Nice stuff man, love the Kasumi statue, I have the same one next to me right now haha. Since youre a massive DOA fan like myself, are you interested in a Kasumi Blue XBOX? I can help get one for you :)  That iPhone cover I believe was a prize Team Ninja were giving away so amazing score on that! Look forward to your upcoming videos man.
retrogametech Soft mod and firmware hack :)
retrogametech I do enjoy this style of video! Cant beat a good waffle.
retrogametech Scanlines make the Wii look better cause it breaks up the horrible lack of antialiasing. Im guessing it would make the xbox look better too if Im honest.
retrogametech Thanks for the suggestion. Ill keep a look out for a copy. I was playing some ODST myself the other day. Id forgotten how many Firefly cast and references are in that game! :)
retrogametech I actually tried it with the Xbox and it didnt look very good at all. The original Xbox looks nice in 720p using the component cables anyway. But the Wii for whatever reason looks bad hooking it up directly using either component or RGB SCART. Running it at 480p in 4:3 ratio through the scaler and SLG make a big difference :)
retrogametech Retro, are you a PC Gamer as well?
retrogametech You Sir, are the fricken Ganesh of console repair!!
retrogametech This was just a bit of a one off, sorry. I dont normally do repairs on other peoples hardware. Im also not too familiar with the Famicom so probably wouldnt be much help to you :P
retrogametech Its on its way back to you right now :)
retrogametech unbelievable patience and skill! does anyone know where I can get a game gear fixed? there used to be an ebay ad for fixing them but it doesnt exist anymore. any help would be appreciated! I know nothing about them or how to do the type of work retrogametech does.
retrogametech Your like a console doctor mate well impressed I have a dreamcast that is a tad messed up been trying to get it going for a while managed to get it to run for about 15 mins at a time and it conks out. Respect to a fellow scotsman lol
retrogametech Its not too difficult. Just reconnect the traces that were severed and solder on some new components :) . No formal training, just learn as I go and watching vidsreading tuts online.
retrogametech Ive been watching your vids for the past few weeks and you have inspired me to start fixing faulty consoles again. Just love it how you able to bring retro consoles back from the dead just superb.
retrogametech Haha, no more repairs from me for a while! :P
retrogametech you can replace those microswitches with the pushbuttons you showed ! look over at mmmonkey, he has done it before, its no big deal.
retrogametech Thanks. Even if it was beyond repair I would have used it for spares or another project. Appreciate the support :)
retrogametech Thanks for your videos.I like them a lot.Do you use regular cleaning material for the plastic parts like liquid soap or an industrial cleaner?
retrogametech your from ayrshire or there abouts right? do i win a cookie
retrogametech Awesome, 2 videos in such A short time!
retrogametech i noticed on alot of your videos you say you sell stuff on ebay i was just wondering if it would be possible to get a link so i can see what you have for sale? thanks :)
retrogametech Hey Martin, I checked the site and couldnt find it either but I found his video on here. I cant add the video link but if you want to do so you will have to just put in the title and you can find it. Its Titled: How to Fix a Broken NeoGeo CD Pad Controller :) Hopefully that will help out a bit. The controllers are great and very nice to use for sure. I wish they werent going up in price all over the place recently, just unreal.
retrogametech Time for a rebuild! A lot of the time those discs can just be refurbished instead of completely replaced. But GBA SPs contain the parts if you need them.
retrogametech great job fixing it dude! you should make arcade out of that tv and your neo geo, that would be soo cool dude :)
retrogametech Ive been enjoying this game immensely and this has just added to it. Awesome idea and it turned out well.
retrogametech I have a JTAG hacked console but you can do that on a normal 360 anyway :P. Id really just like to see an official disc release :)
retrogametech Almost.. :P What ever happened to that 360 you picked up a while back? Did you manage to fix it? 360PS3 wont be modern for too much longer :P
retrogametech my suggestion? copy the dlc onto a usb memory stick formated by the xbox and stick it in there with a nice label on it. a cf card would look better but eh you cant use them with an xbox
retrogametech That box is amazing. 1010.
retrogametech Its loads of fun. Ive been burnt out on first person shooters for a while now. Stopped playing COD a few games back and found Halo 4BioShock Infinite really dull. Blood Dragon on the other hand has a very OTT pisstake, Duke Nukem, oldschool attitude and feel to it. Its a total blast to play :). The sound and art design are brilliant as well! Ive not played any of the Farcry games since the original one on Xbox. Never been a big fan.
retrogametech Thats some excellent work there going to download the image.
retrogametech I always thought that little hole was made for something else
retrogametech wow who knew that there was a Sega Modem before the Sega Channel? I learned something new today.
retrogametech Is this like the Sega Saturn where you can still play online without lag or did these run on servers?
retrogametech Ive heard of it but didnt know they supported it until 2000. Thats pretty crazy! Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech I thought the dreamcast was the first to start this but damn I miss sega counsels ),: we should have a kickstart for another sega counsel
retrogametech Im sure you guys know, but the Snes had one also, called Satellaview, a satellite modem that had a very similar interface to what is now on the Wii U, with the little online area you walk around.
retrogametech WOW great video, shocking that Sega had this for its system in 1990! The U.S. was left out such an advancement. If the modem sales did better in Japan, makes you wonder if it could have been released in the U.S.?
retrogametech You can do your shopping at home or play Mortal Kombat with a friend in Vietnam
retrogametech Do you know if the modem would work on a Genesis in North America? I have the Sega Channel adapter and I love the old Sega peripherals. Thanks!
retrogametech Lmao I get crts for nuffin...
retrogametech Not done anything like that but the Saturn is good for its arcade ports and 2D shooters. And the original Xbox has a pretty broad range of good games to choose from :)
retrogametech Like ghosting? Are your cables good qualitywell shielded? Dodgy cables can cause that type of effect. It might be something very simple to put right.
retrogametech Im waiting for my RGB SCARTComponent converter since thats the only way to do it here. Plan to hook my MDMCD32x up via it. Cant wait to get rid of composite.
retrogametech Interesting stuff. I didnt know that. Maybe building your own cables would be cheaper?
retrogametech Really? The last couple of TVs Ive owned produced scanlines on lowres inputs from the likes of my Mega DriveMaster System. The other Sony Trinitron I still own produces scanlines by default when hooked up to the MVS or any other retro console. Theyre supposed to be there and I think they look beautiful :)
retrogametech Almost every TV has a hidden service menu, google your TV make and model and service menu.
retrogametech and does it matter what model playstation you have, will it pick up rgb trhough an rgb scart no matter what playstation? talking about the ps1. please write back. thanks
retrogametech what brand is your rgb scart? im trying to look for the best possible, is that a top 1 that youve got? please write back to me. thanks
retrogametech : oh man I wish the america had scart
retrogametech Great vid man, I bought one for my arcade machine since I replaced my monitor with 24inch led screen and slg3000 works awesome and picture is 10X better then before, slg3000 rocks
retrogametech Thanks. I got mine direct from Arcade Forge in Germany. Im not sure where else sells them.
retrogametech Silly me! Ive watched it when you released the video and today I remembered to comment and didnt remembered that you had the full kit! Is it possible to connect an NES using composite ( Scart NES are somewhat rare and expensive!) to the scaler and get image? I plan to connect all of my consoles to the Kit and I dont know if Im able to connect the NES. I use an HP W2408H monitor for my recent consoles. Cheers!
retrogametech It really gives 2D games a nice arcady look :D . Thanks for watching!
retrogametech Does the scanline generator only work with a 640x480 feed?
retrogametech no frame drops, no jerkiness, no weird upscaling that adds things to the picture that the artists didnt draw. lcds are too perfect and the low resolution becomes really apparent and like a mosaic, especially on the 50 inch monsters we have today. but one thing about this black lines is that it makes our brain handle the scaling and fill in those gaps and it does a much better job than any software scaler ever will do.
retrogametech awesome video. that looks to be well worth it. whats the best place to get one?
retrogametech 13:44 Yeah, watch those boobs bounce...WITH MORE DEFINITION! D
retrogametech Screw the smart phones! You should use the NGage as you main mobile phone :D I bet it has better batterylife too. Loved those modem dial up sounds. Brings back a lot of memories from the good old BBS days :)
retrogametech you need fiberoptic mate lol
retrogametech Ill do a full reviewunboxing in the next few weeks :)
retrogametech Thats pretty neat :D Dreamcast was the first to come with a online modem though (EUUS)
retrogametech Maybe. Worth a try. But at a guess (although I have never opened one so I cannot know) I think the megadrive modem would likely have some sort of pain in the arse sega only ROM telling it to take over part of the functionality that would normally be written into a game (like would be written into a PC game). However, after that, in the modem, I bet thered be some standard modem chipset, at which point youd solder in a cable. And then emulate the modem with your pc. In fact, either way do that.
retrogametech I would very much like to see you do an unboxing and review of that modem, it looks awesome.
retrogametech thats just a hoot lol
retrogametech What phone you have other then the N Gage?
retrogametech Haha, its just an old SIM that came with one of my bundles a while back. It now lives in my NGage since the console cannot be used with a SIM inserted :P
retrogametech Beautiful sceenery...thanks for the ride!
retrogametech Curious... What ya driving in this?
retrogametech Thanks for the reply man! For a geezer thats from UK  Ireland I dont know much about Scotland lol! Love the Vids man, epic stuff
retrogametech In Ayrshire its just grey and no snow..
retrogametech Time for me to turn on my xbox live and play a outrun playthrough now
retrogametech getting snow in march, you sound shocked we live in scotland its always snowingraininghailwindy basically everything except sunny lol
retrogametech Why have you speeded the footage up?
retrogametech It usually always that same top ribbon cable, Fix quite a few of them, just by reseating the cables .
retrogametech Ha I won a Broken Xbox off eBay, for 10 AUD and it actually worked! Bit of a sticky drive, but it came complete with 20GB hard drive, WiFi adapter and power supply. It was a 2009 model so it came with HDMI and because it was Arcade there was an extra 500MB built in  the 20GB hard drive included. Found a spare HDMI lead lying around and boom I had a 2nd 360 in my house, now lives in my study and is mostly used for Chat and FIFA and my other one is a 20072011 (2007 model RRODd in early 2012 so on its age must check) model and is used for all my media and the occasional Spit Screen party with mates. SCORE
retrogametech Please god help me fix my R trigger :(
retrogametech I need to know... Youve called this your hobby, but it seems like you make a lot of cash doing it. Are you one of those supersellers on eBay or do you have a day job?
retrogametech where did you learn how to repair stuff?
retrogametech You are fully of surprises lol.
retrogametech how much for the ds lites?
retrogametech Tbh I was a little surprised they offered me so much in cash. The store credit was only marginally better at 80 so it was a no brainer to go the cash option :) Glad the other vid helped! :)
retrogametech You should get one of these things. Fix it. Return it to the seller for a refund. Put a note in the box saying that you fixed it, and for them to enjoy their once broken hardware. They will be so surprised and grateful. You would REALLY make someones day.
retrogametech Great collection, well done mate. Im a fellow collector, who has begun collecting 5 years after selling on an almost entire collection of games, prerelease demos and other swag. Finding it incredibly different now to collect again. One question, where did you get the black QD fascia? Id love one of those.
retrogametech dud, good clolection, but you still dont have all of them. There were 77 games made. My favrite is Civialization and Myst.
retrogametech Haha, could you guess I was kinda tired when I recorded that segment :P
retrogametech Whats your favourite, Ashen will always have a place in my heart. I loved it back in 20034 on my long trips to school, classic style fps.
retrogametech great work on collecting them all, could you maybe do a vid with your top 5 best games  top 5 worst games???  i love to see sega rally! love that game  would also love to see it shat out the arse of the ngage P
retrogametech Wow, talk about playing on the go now haha.
retrogametech Well thanks for watching and taking the time to comment :)
retrogametech Once again, thanks for the great video and I hope you enjoy your complete collection :) Well done!
retrogametech Could you do a gameplay for tomb raider
retrogametech FREEKS fuck you autocorrect
retrogametech I actually specifically swapped the sticks for the two controllers, The original xbox ones are tighter but they both fit in the opposite controller.
retrogametech Ive done similar mods to some thord party Original Xbox pads. Swapping the horrible cheapo sticks with some official ones.
retrogametech Ive seen people heat the end of a biro with a cigarette lighter then push that into the screw hole as a temporary screw bit too.
retrogametech Hey man, Ive been watching your videos for some time. Always looking forward to an upload from you! Anyways Ive been wondering, where do you go to buy all your consoles and games? Do you just use Ebay? Ive been wanting to get into fixing up consoles, and youve helped motivate that for me! So thanks!
retrogametech you know how to take the limited edition halo 4 controller mine fell on the ground and this caused the left bumper to go downward and stick it still is half way popped up and I can press it the only problem is I want it the way it was if I take it apart like you did can I adjust the spring or is the spring going to need to be replaced
retrogametech is an amazing looking game even now, and is probably one of the best games for 2 players, huge fun i remember having with DOA 2 when the Dreamcast was new.
retrogametech DOA 2 LE was like the best for the Dreamcast... I really had fun with my friend when i played this, although I lost my skill and he won 255, ouch!!
retrogametech Loved this game for Dreamcast. Can you kick your opponent through the round window in the first stage? I thought this game had some multiteared stages.
retrogametech Me and my friend joked about fighting games. We said Dead Or Alive was on the leading edge of Jiggle Physics and was a fighting game second. We were Street Fighter nerds. However sense I started playing DoAD for the 3ds I have taken a liking to the series. It lacks that street fighter feel, but it has an unbelievable polish.
retrogametech Never a let down with your videos. Good man.
retrogametech One of my favourites :)
retrogametech Are you going to play Sonic Adventure next!?!?
retrogametech Thanks. The SLG only has one VGA input. Youre best option would be to get a switcher of some sort. I might do a vid about it soon. Ive been using mine for a few weeks now and love the thing. I only use it on the Dreamcast though. I wasnt too impressed with its performance while using the Mega Drive or Saturn.
retrogametech Yeah, the sky was a pretty cool colour that day :)
retrogametech Thanks, really glad you enjoyed it! :) I actually had this video uploaded and sitting on my channel as private for about a week. I wasnt sure how it would be received since its not quite gaming related. Its good to know people have liked it :)
retrogametech omg everyone in going on the wrong side of the road xDDD
retrogametech Were some of the parked cars halfway in the lane you were in so you had to dodge them? ( 2:26 ) Is that a normal thing? I noticed that too in some Japan driving vids and it just seems like a very bad idea... CRASH!
retrogametech you from hamilton ??? i stay like 5 mins away, in bellshill :P
retrogametech Looks so much like COPS haha. I miss that show
retrogametech The three best sources are as follows: eBay (just search for DMG backlight) kitschbent . com (offers both single color backlights and ones with an RGB LED to allow for different colors to be selected) nonelectronics . com (Nonfinite is similar to Kitsch)
retrogametech you can solder to the 2 points dirrectly below the ribbon cable at the bottom
retrogametech I remember that video of yours, Ill just have to dig though the mountain of broken ds screens i have LOL thank you
retrogametech Would you be able to use one of the late model, backlit SPs to replace an original GBA or even GBC screen for the backlight?
retrogametech Oldie but goodies! As love old fashioned stuff like this!
retrogametech I tried this mod after watching you video. I messed up though. After peeling the back reflective piece off I had a sticky residue remaining on the back on the screen. Is that normal or did I not peel it correctly? I also put too much stress on the LCD and one I installed the actual backlight the LCD had pixels missing. Not sure if its beyond repair now. Not as easy as it looks!
retrogametech Have you tried rotating the dark polarizing film 90 degrees when you put it between the backlight and the screen? If you put it in at the wrong rotation that will invert the image.
retrogametech hey thanx for the inspiration on this, just finished mine. do you think the white makes the screen a little washed out?
retrogametech You have backlights on the brain! xD
retrogametech there was going to be one. there are pictures of it
retrogametech Very cool! I might have to try this mod soon...
retrogametech Thanks, I appreciate that :)
retrogametech Man how great and ahead of there time was the dreamcast btw love the Doa music
retrogametech great work martin , awesome stuff as allways! i still not found a dreamcast! still got the vmu! ready! lol )
retrogametech Awesome, Ill give it a try this week, have a bunch of DS spare parts here
retrogametech Greaselubricate the rails the laser assembly is on, that and installing a quieter case fan. Definitely greasing the rails as it made a massive difference for me.
retrogametech Wow, good memory, lol. Id totally forgotten about that. That was a console someone sent me to be modded with a region free BIOS. Theyd imported it from the US if I remember correctly.
retrogametech Great video. Thumbs up! Would be cool to see you reflowing solder on something like this console. You got a working console with 20minutes work and 11.50. So that is great. I wouldnt personally call it pretty much mint condition mind you, considering the insides. Ha ha. Keep up the good work. Well done repairing it. All the best.
retrogametech Your Genesis Monster was staring at me this whole video.
retrogametech Turbografx design was such a minger for a console  nice repair though :)
retrogametech I know but its funny how you call it a garbage bag.
retrogametech Was that Sony chip part of the sound system by any chance? Seen a very similar looking chip in my stereo.
retrogametech Not a bad find, eh? :)
retrogametech I couldnt agree more. The difference between 50Hz and 60Hz is quite noteable on this system. Ive read little bit into it and it seems youd need a crystal with very strange MHz rating which you cant find anywhere else than in 60Hz Turbrograx16 or PCEngines.
retrogametech wow really nice and good deal..
retrogametech Its from about 1989. It was never really popular in North America... AFAIK it got no TV advertising, and it was primarily sold at Radio Shack, so yeah.
retrogametech Awesome score on the 32x games there Martin and bootleg galore lol. I was wondering though, is that bare knuckle 3 a boot as well? Looks a bit different than the one I have. Great to see another vid from you bro. Feel free to do a bit of a long play or just gaming review on any of your games in your collection, that would be fun to watch as well
retrogametech do you have any game boy advance sp for sale?
retrogametech Awesome video, as ever. Ecco the Dolphin is brutally hard and has a very darktheme throughout, considering youre a dolphin. Brilliant game with a wicked soundtrack.
retrogametech Awesome video as ever Martin :)
retrogametech the bundle copy of dead or alive 2 would be one that came with the dreamcast console it probably would have had an extra controller with it too you know like if you buy kinect you get kinect adventures free. hope that helps martin.
retrogametech Metal slug, boot or not was a great score
retrogametech hi martin great pick ups thhose massive mvs carts are soo cool! , and the art work on jap megadrive32x carts look so much cooler, great stuff :)
retrogametech Lol, well some of the older MVS boards those carts slot into can be mahoosive :P . The AES is basically the same Neo Geo arcade hardware but consolized and redesigned to use a larger cartridge. It was to stop arcade and home consoles from being cross compatible (I believe arcade carts cost 1000s where home carts only cost 100s). Almost arcade perfect yes. I think the sound is not quite as good? The Saturn has the arcade perfect version :)
retrogametech Retro bit console I ask bout software I also wanna no can I install a Gba emulator on my harddrive n get it to work on retro bit console wit software
retrogametech So will this work with pokemon games? Because the gb smart cart thing wont. I wish I had known that before I bought one
retrogametech with this project can you also flash pc bios chips to if so that will save us a lot of time and will be easy to use i will try to find a programme that dos PC bios flashing to
retrogametech It may be a long shot, but do you think you could try making a sort of SNES or N64 flash cart?
retrogametech Hey Thomas! Good to hear from you! Programmer is very cool. I think itll come in handy for future projects :) . Surprisingly cheap too!
retrogametech cool project, a good way to to get rid of those shitty sports games.
retrogametech Thanks Ed. Good to hear from you too! Xmasnew year was a busy time! Been taking a bit of a break from making vids. Catching up on some projects and actually playing my games :)
retrogametech Do you know how to do this to gameboy advance as well?
retrogametech Cool, Ive still to try out LSDJ on mine. It looks complicated! haha
retrogametech The game probably has the common problem of the battery dieing in which case you just need to solder in a new one
retrogametech Just to inform ya dude,gb system is not trash,its one of the most succseed nintendos console system,one of the nest portable console ever made in the age of its release
retrogametech I have two still in the box, never opened and with the factory seal on the box, Im not ready to sell them!!!! I think Im going to wait another 25 years!
retrogametech then why everyone calling them DMG? sorry for my ignorance...
retrogametech Hope the previous owner is watching..
retrogametech Can i buy the conkers pocket tales from you?
retrogametech RetroGameTech, was the repairing process of this GameBoy enjoyable in the sense that the end result was well worth it?
retrogametech Zach Radge, The easiest way to do it is the take out the mother board from the front housing and just push it out from the inside
retrogametech I find double sided tape works really well for reattaching GB screens :)
retrogametech Heres the answer to your question: Im from Scotland. I dont actually like Iron Bru but I have actually tried a deep fried Mars Bar ONCE. And literally everyone around looked at me like I was crazy. Not as popular as you may think hahaha It was pretty good though, just sort of crunchy and gooey but I wouldnt have it again :)
retrogametech Retro Game Tech, you are a hero. Kudos for sending the Bru and Macaroon bar overseas. Hope you like em Luke.
retrogametech Great. A ton of thought definitely went into that small package!!
retrogametech Thanks bro, I appreciate that you thought of me man :) dont go out of your way bro :)
retrogametech super thoughtful gift! Martin is an awesome dude, love his channel for sure!
retrogametech Iron Bru is the best drink!
retrogametech Oh, interesting stuff man, thanks a lot
retrogametech for sure bro, wasnt expecting that at all haha. Merry Christmas to you too!!
retrogametech Good to see that all of the retro guys on youtube stay in contact. I watch every upload from both of you guys!
retrogametech That is the stupidest fucking idea.
retrogametech i try to download zombiu demo or even look at the details and it says you cannot not view or purchase this software
retrogametech I think if Nintendo wants to be kiddie friendly, let them If you can buy another system, do it. If a company is dumb enough to restrict their own content, dont buy from them.
retrogametech what the hell nintendo...lol. I could make a 20 min video on nintendo rants but thats crazy I dont think its like that over here. Seems just silly , I was watching the nintendo direct video on youtube and I found it strange they where showing clips of ninja giadin without age restritions and the whole video was filled blood.Its probibly set up totally differant because there is no way to watch Wii U trailers on the 3ds that I can see.Also thats the main reason I want a wii u bayonetta 2
retrogametech Disgrace, nice video :)but i suppose its not a really bad idea
retrogametech please ignore the stupid internet people P
retrogametech neeeeeeeeeeeeeeew viiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid :D :D :D
retrogametech I got the 3DS as I figured trading in my DS and a old phone (that had been sitting in a drawer) against the system was a good idea, as I was only going to pay about 11 cash. Still be able to play DS games and get some 3DS games like the Ocarina remake etc. Nintendo restricting access to everyone at certain times is ridiculous. Im 25, not 7, if I want to download an 18 game at 6pm then I should be able to. Im really losing patience with Nintendo.
retrogametech Basically, unless you are a five year old kid, there is no interesting content in eShop now.
retrogametech Thats not how you spell Acclaim lol.
retrogametech I would like a guide on how to mod a front lit gba sp to be back lit cant seem to find any on youtube.
retrogametech that drill game looks pretty cool
retrogametech Eating lots of food and playing lots of games :) . The average price is 5060. A good price would be anything below 50, I guess. Theyre not easy to find and are generally very desirable.
retrogametech Gets a thumbs up just for your bargain hunting skills  20 for a 101 is a bit of a result!
retrogametech Must have been a different auction. I won both of those in a bundle for 20 on a buy it now a couple of months back.
retrogametech The thing that makes me feel old is watching a GBA gameplay vid here on YouTube then reading the comments. Theyre always filled with people talking about how they remember GBA games from their childhood!?!?.. Their childhood!?!??
retrogametech RetroGameTech What are you going to be doing for Christmas and the New Year?
retrogametech Well worth it. It shouldnt take you more than half an hour to complete. The RF unit is very easily desoldered and once its out youll have loads of space to work with! Id actually be kinda interested to hear if you notice any improvements in audiovideo quality after removing it. Possible less interference on the video circuitry?
retrogametech It makes some games run smoother. Overclocking doesnt speed anything up in terms of what you see on screen. It just gives the CPU a little extra grunt to deal with processing. If you search for Fully Modded Mega Drive here on YT youll see another vid I did comparing a stock 7MHz and overclocked 10MHz Mega Drive.
retrogametech Great idea swapping the RF port for a headphone jack. Rocker switches look great and are really satisfying to press  if that makes sense.
retrogametech Thanks for the heads up. Unfortunately my PC isnt really powerful enough for modern gaming. Sounds like a excellent deal though! I take it youre all over it? haha
retrogametech I have always used the slide type for this type of mod, wonder how well the rocker ones would fit in a model 2 sega genesis. Totally agree, there is no reason to use RF these days. Only console I cant bring myself to mod is my atari : Its a member of the family and modding a member of your family just seems... wrong. LOOKS GREAT BTW! :)
retrogametech Thats pretty much been proven to be the worst Genesis ever made. The model 1 usually has the best sound quality (Like, by a pretty huge difference, you can hear a comparison on Wikipedia). However some of the later Model 1s have the same motherboard as the Model 2s, so you gotta be careful about how the ports are arranged at the back. The Model 2s have the best video quality, with brighter colors and such. But audio and build quality arent as good as Model 1s.
retrogametech great videos. Ive just got myself a Mk. 1 Mega Drive and wanted to install the Jap, 5060 and audio mod. Is there any chance you will do any tutorials for these? Youll be a lot easier to follow than some of the ones on you tube i have come across. If not if you could point me in the right direction. I was also looking at you rca mod but wanted to ask if i should do that or just get the scart cable which i heard was better?
retrogametech I see a lot of them on ebay really cheap so its worth taking a quick look there :) . I found mine on there boxed for 12 delivered!
retrogametech beautiful.. the pinnacle of mega drive gaming. ive got all that pimpage except for the over clock. damn shame the region lock out on later games prohibits full screen switching (with my types of switches anyway)
retrogametech Its going to look great!
retrogametech Looks like your project is coming along nicely, will be interesting to see your progress on the next update.
retrogametech How come the MVS can simply run off a 9v AC adaptor, yet all these custom superfund Ive seen need those massive PC power adapters?
retrogametech cool video, nice to see that you also picked up one of these multicarts, itts gonna save you a lot of money and pluggingunplugging cartridges :D i would also just go with the RGB scart output, the picture should be great and it should be all fine ) some people just go crazy with putting in to many videooutputs x.X
retrogametech Looking sweet dude. Defo going to be keeping an eye on these VLOGs :D
retrogametech OOOOHHHHH!!! You gotta get one of those RGBscart to hdmi converter boxes. I use an upscaling one with my dreamcast. If you can modify the RGB upscaler to fit inside your console (and not need the AC adapter), youll have the most badass 1080p MVS console ever! Also you can play your MVS on Pal and NTSC tvs if you do the upscaler mod
retrogametech wowowowow! wait explicit content wich i have not seen yet? OO in wich game? :D
retrogametech Will you be doing a follow up video to this any time soon?
retrogametech phillips head screw driver
retrogametech I have the blue Japanese dreamcast I am never going to take that apart
retrogametech Question: Not trying to sound cocky or anything but why would you do this?
retrogametech I like the design of Dreamcasts internals, its very neat and logical.
retrogametech I Place My Screws Down On A Flat Surface In The Pattern They Were In, In The Console.
retrogametech didnt japan have the RED logo orange is U.S. logo i got 2 of em im pretty sure lol
retrogametech Thanks dude. Yeah those screwdrivers come in really handy sometimes. Makes the job that bit easier! :)
retrogametech Me Too But I Really Dont Like Typing Like This so I think Ill stop.
retrogametech Your sega looks like it could take over the world lol :)
retrogametech Ok, didnt know that thanks!
retrogametech Hi, RGT if you ever get your hands on a kinect could you show it being used by windows? I heard you can actually control windows with a kinect.
retrogametech I completely agree with the description of the Space Harrier music.
retrogametech Its weird how people know Martin from Luke but with me its the other way round XD
retrogametech Man you were not joking with the StepsVengaboys mashup music lol terrible!
retrogametech thanks for the shout out dude! was fun to make a response! no ginger cat pick up? lol cool u picked up sega classic collection! i picked that up a few years aga ar car boot! only played out run your vid will make me play it again! great work dude:)
retrogametech Bonanza Bros is my favourite megadrive game in that collection and you didnt show it xD but if I can get the collection for 4 I will!
retrogametech Ive got the SEGA Classics collection on PS2 like you have but I have to use the PCSX2 Emulator on my PC to play it.... I dont have a PS2 anymore nor a PS2 Capable PS3 :(
retrogametech You couldve used a tooth pick instead of a q tip for the smaller parts
retrogametech Nice one dude you have helped me de solder a card slot on a ds lite i know there not the same but the card slots arent to far off. Superb, keep up the good work.
retrogametech Ayo i got a ds lite for u to fix
retrogametech Awesome... (Also, I need to work on my soldering skills so that I can do this replacement easily.) Theres this guy in my local chinatown that repairs and resolders old and new consoles. He always has a few 3DSes. :D
retrogametech Wish i could solder like that, i always screw it up. Hell, i killed 2 xboxs trying to get a modchip in. I gave up and found a 1.5 on the ebay and got that.
retrogametech 13:29 It like you just stabbed yourself with the iron lol.
retrogametech I strongly agree with this guy.
retrogametech Living your work mate. Watching a lot of your videos just now. Old skool gamer and scottish just like myself! Keep up the good work
retrogametech AMAZING set up mate! unfortunately im unable to find NES games too! i live in melbourne, ive found a couple here and there but i have to mostly get them from ebay!! ive just started collecting and i have to say for a person that lives in australia you have a great collection
retrogametech Thanks Martian! Very rare game actually, luckily some collector wanted to part with it. Hope you enjoy my other video too :). Haha, yep was super expensive  I had to get it though Im a huge DoA fan. No worries man, love your videos!
retrogametech Wish i had one of those super famicom boxes but there too expensive. or the old NES one would be sweet.
retrogametech Thats the only thing about Japan I think I would dislike, small spaces, Im already enough of a hoarder, if I had less space Id be on TV :) Nice video!
retrogametech PS2 got a cool softmod a while ago using a gameshark and special disc. I got it on my old phat ps2, plays isos off an hdd. Sure not every single game works but most of the games i own do.
retrogametech He is living in Japan.. small housesappartments everywhere!
retrogametech I was hoping to have it done a while ago but between moving and essays galore I have no time. Ill eventually get to it when ive setup my computer.
retrogametech How do u make ur older consoles look decent on ur tv???
retrogametech I completely agree... Not to mention I like to wait a few months so the game prices go down to somewhere around 30. I think 60 is absurd for a new game unless you can get 50hrs of good gameplay out of it IE Skyrim, Fallout, GTA, Red Dead Redemption.
retrogametech Thanks dude! Yeah Shadow Dancer is great! Found that cart on ebay super cheap! :)
retrogametech Definitely worth picking up! Cost me about 30 2 years ago and plays 1080p mkv files and just about anything else you throw at it! :)
retrogametech MD is still here, that is going NO WHERE! Unless the hou... no I am not finishing that sentence. The SMS is gone, and the broken DC is a footrest. Its all its good for.
retrogametech Your hardware is so awesome!!
retrogametech I am always blown away by your setup. It looks like you put so much time and effort into it. I would be really proud if I ever pulled off anything half as tidy as that ) Keep it up :D
retrogametech xbox360 and ps3 will never be considered retro. )
retrogametech buying one without anything on it is ok but gameseven firmware you cant thats where the law comes into play thats why you have to downlod the firmware for them onto the cards but you need a micro sd memory card as well to do so
retrogametech There is more than one type of firmware? No wonder I cant get the stupid thing to work.
retrogametech a lot of the time, larger micro sd cards are the issue, try putting the firmware on a 2gb card.
retrogametech They arent illegal to have. Youre no longer allowed to sell them but thats about it. And that really only applies to bigger resellers who might want to import a large quantity for openly selling to the general public. Selling or bundling these off secondhand wont be any issue.
retrogametech Can someone link or tell me wich FLASHCARDs there are the best for softmoding DS,DSL,DSI,DSi or XL
retrogametech I remember Chinese stores selling the original R4s for a pound each when they did the update and stopped them from working. But the R4i ones can definitely be reflashed.
retrogametech please tell me cause i really want one of thecause i cntt find any of them on ebay
retrogametech where can i find a case like that for DS games? P.S I live in Greece and its very hard to find.
retrogametech AAAAAGGGHHH!!! If my ears had legs theyed be running away right now
retrogametech why the hell is this in color i know that you playing on the GBA but make a video of plaing it on the original gameboy
retrogametech I dont think that game actually looks too bad. The graphics are better than thte Game Gear games. Though it obviously has some horrid issues.
retrogametech His accent tells me hes from Scotland
retrogametech These console homebrew hack like games really usually put in music as an after thought. I would like to play one someday with decent music. haha
retrogametech YOU. HAVE. BEEN. WARNED.
retrogametech Well, since were being all pedantic... Tip: Game Boy is actually two separate words. Also the actual GBA used in this vid is an AGS001 SP NES edition which has been modified using the guts of a pink backlit AGS101. Do you think I should also quote all of these unnecessary details everytime I use the console in a video? Surely when I say Ill be using a backlit Game Boy Advance thats enough info for anyone. :P
retrogametech I Believe In A Thing Called Love by The Darkness? Horrible
retrogametech Have you ever listened to a dialup modem trying to connect to the internet or a ZX Spectrum loading a game? No? My friend, youre in for a real treat! :P
retrogametech uhh thats what he said
retrogametech I Was Playing Pokemon Mystery Dungeon On My DSI And When I Switched It To The 3DS I Noticed It Right Away.
retrogametech Cool GBA SP. Interesting stuff man, hopefully there are no problems while fixing them. Those have to be some of the cleanest NESs I have seen too.
retrogametech They were never officially released in the UK so no not really. You can very occasionally find imported units on ebay. Pretty rare though and quite expensive.
retrogametech Whats your ebay account?
retrogametech Lol, Its weird, definitely not a colour Id usually go for. But when you see them in real life they look awesome! The real colour doesnt really come across on camera.
retrogametech I can drop you a PM when I get around listing it. I dont generally share my ebay details on YouTube for security reasons.
retrogametech Its best to just wash your hands and not think about these things! :P
retrogametech class man how you fix them up then sell them off
retrogametech I could never let my stuff get dirty like that, my GBA SP is a little scratched but that was more the previous owner and my little brother and sister than me.
retrogametech Man, I love your floors. I am in awe every time you shoot a video.
retrogametech Haha, seems Im a little late to the party judging by some of the comments :P . Theres another really cool mod Ive heard about where you can run all 3 systems with a single Sega PSU plugged into just the Mega Drive. The 32X gets powered though the cart slot and MCD through the expansion bay. It involves reworking some of the internal power circuitry in all three but I cant find any solid details on the mod. That would be the ultimate setup!
retrogametech Wow your power plugs are different than my north American plugs
retrogametech Sounds like you need a couple of those Sega strips! lol
retrogametech its a nice thing you have fuses in your plugs. in europe we only have circuit breakers, usually one for each room of the house.
retrogametech Awesome! Look very tidy.
retrogametech I was going to say the same.
retrogametech Do you know how to fix the sync issue on mega drive when you using RGB ?
retrogametech You can buy these on retrogamecave They call it the Sega Trio
retrogametech A good alternative to M.A.M.E.
retrogametech Do you have a desoldering iron? You say it took forever to desolder the ICs, I felt that way too until I got a Hakko 808. Expensive but saves an AMAZING amount of time if youre constantly working on stuff like me, and also you have the heat on your components for a lower amount of time, greatly minimizing chances to damage componentsburn traces. Highly recommended.
retrogametech Could you tell me how to fix an n64 controller from the joystick not having resistance? Thanks
retrogametech Thanks, Ed! Yeah that the first time Id ever tried one of those controllers. Very cool! Love the clicky direction pad. All controllers should have this!!! Up close the picture looks like its a little over exposed on the white or light coloured graphics. I think it just needs a little adjustment. Adding some pots to the RGB and Sync lines should sort it out.
retrogametech About the paint...I like to spray it but you can use a very thin nap roller and tip it off with a foam brush. Id go with a Latex paint. Dries good and easy to clean up with water. I hope you feel better!
retrogametech Because hes a thinker )
retrogametech Now, I wanna play PKMN gen1 for some unknown reason...
retrogametech Its just blank info, sadly. 00s repeated to 32mb. :S
retrogametech The ROM was just blank. Nothing youre missing out on, heh. :P Well, I think that the pirated games use the same encryption as Pokemon Emerald. The bad thing is that the games are SO badly built that they hardly ever work.
retrogametech more like game of the rear2012
retrogametech I looks awesome I love pirate games one of my faves is Super Mario 4 for gbc
retrogametech Lol, Ive never played a Pokemon game but it really wouldnt surprise me! Theyve borrowed bits from all over the place.
retrogametech i love how sonic walks like a derp
retrogametech It would be nice if a good dump is done for this, Im sure its not that they protected the game but most likely theres a weird data at the beginning of the game that the tool cannot read properly, had the game got more interest Im sure the programmers wouldve found a way to dump this, too bad!
retrogametech I thought you might get a laugh out of this, lol. Dont you hate rom hacks?
retrogametech Are you getting my messages dude?
retrogametech I think you are the real McGuyver! I dont have or know what those are, but this should help someone who does out.
retrogametech God, that typing is so annoying!
retrogametech where would i look for faulty things? i know a bit about soldering, ive soldered LEDs to my xbox, but i can never find faulty consoles, id LOVE to get a faulty gameboy, and fix it. where do i look, and what do i look for thats an easy fix, like soldering 1 or 2 things back to the board?
retrogametech How can i find you on ebay?
retrogametech I think that is showing you work ram error? really strange. If you want to, take the bios out of your other board and put it in that one. the other bios should be in english so give that a shot first :) probably have another trace that is broken on that board somewhere as well. look really really close and you might be able to find it. its close to working but the main blue screen should be a cross hatch without any letters. first though, swap out that bios :)
retrogametech Good idea just to get another board, hopefully with the best bits of each board you can get it working. Is the game definitely OK?
retrogametech This is about as accurate as i can get for describingstating what each incorrect letter means: s  r !  space u  t o  n q  p faint o  t faint h  h bfaint d  d g  f e  d c  b m  l y  x
retrogametech Will check it out. Thanks for the tip!
retrogametech hope you get that thing running, awesome that youre showing us your constant progress and excitement about what it is youre doing. its basically fuel to help me fix or create something. thanks!
retrogametech Nice video!! Good info
retrogametech The thing with the game saves is true, I used to do that with emulators running on my modded PSP sometimes. The only thing I use now is MAME (running in a mario bros replica nintendo cab I have built, it has special settings for low res on arcade monitor now). I have a few arcade cabinets but I cant buy them all so emulation sure is cool if it can be done on original screen and resolution :D
retrogametech That Or They Ask Dumbass Questions.
retrogametech RetroGameTech I did it the cheapest way possible.
retrogametech sorry you will nto save money in the long run. you will spend more money since have to replace batteries so much. i have snes games that still have good batteries in it too and they used 2032 too i think.
retrogametech thank you for this tip i was wondering about if i could use a holder instead of having to resoldier ever time
retrogametech i wish those battery holders fit inside my pokemon red :(
retrogametech I think many of the Pokemon Games have batteries, for the real time clock afaik.
retrogametech Time to go Fleebay shopping...
retrogametech When the tray doesnt come open you have to tap the top of it. Not to hard but just enough. Thats what mine does.
retrogametech i bet the seller on ebay is watching this yelling HOLY SHIT ALL I HAD TO DO WAS PRESS THAT FUCKING BUTTON!
retrogametech Hey guys, I am desperate to find a clear x3 lcd front panel, if anyone knows of were I can get one from, please, please let me know. I have a clear modded xbox with x3 chip in  have been trying to find a front panel for a very long time. TiA...
retrogametech Robbery with a willing victim! I love it sir!
retrogametech I got the same thing frim ebay gir free
retrogametech What did you search on ebay? I have an XBOX DVT4 Kit, and I want a modded xbox too.
retrogametech I got the same thing from ebay for free
retrogametech Awesome find! I always wanted one of these cases after I got my first 2.3b Lite but read somewhere that it would be incompatible with either the screen or just the protection switches. Of course at that time I didnt know half as much about them as I do now. How do the usb ports work exactly? Do they take away one of the ports? Ive always wondered that but never got a hold of one of these official faceplates to figure it out.
retrogametech I keep on watching for updates on this like the stock market or something super excited to see if this ends up working
retrogametech take it you are going to desolder the yamaha chip and check below it? id agree that if the battery leaked it may well have leaked in below
retrogametech it looks like its missing a bios chip from the centre there
retrogametech Yea since everyone is so proper Im gonna be the vulgar yank lol if u dont wanna hear martin talk about electronic repairs fuck off !
retrogametech The board will not do anything without a bios chip installed.
retrogametech Epic your videos are brilliant very interesting information. I watch another guy from America called Ben Heck who also mods technology and regenerates retro hardware good stuff addictive watching thanks for making them.
retrogametech that is a really neat little toy.
retrogametech This is like what your parents got you if you were jealous of your sisters Barbie playhouse. lol
retrogametech I got a DS that is from the Nintendo collection
retrogametech These things are fantastic, I have the entire set.
retrogametech Lol, Ill need to find some video game related action figures to pose them with it XD
retrogametech Where did you find this?!
retrogametech That is just so adorable! Cool stuff man, I never got anything good in those egg things.
retrogametech Looks like an adaptor for Sega Channel, which was a cable TV based service for downloading games. I think he made a video about it and Sega Retro has rather a long article too, if youre interested.
retrogametech Lol. Aww man... why did you have to go and point that out! You know my OCD tendencies mean Ill now have to go hunt down another just to display the Power Base! Haha. And yes, that was indeed some genuine unscripted nerdy excitement. Dont act like you wouldnt be the same! :P
retrogametech Haha I saw this video and thought it was one of Lukes videos until I heard your voice.
retrogametech Seems a cool little project youve got yourself there,and great that your getting advice from Luke.I always wanted an MVS cab myself.What are you going to be doing in the way of controllers?
retrogametech You can ask Luke anything and hell give you a cool long answer hes a retro legend!!!!!!!
retrogametech Ive heard of people putting their PCBs in the dishwasher to achieve the same goal. Is this true, and is it sane to do so?
retrogametech Wow I got a complete master system in my celler complete in box I bought it years and years ago on clearance for 30.00 usd I never played it. Because I had a working one. I may have to dig it out and put it on ebay.
retrogametech Quite surprised a modern 3d shutter glasses would work with master system adapter!
retrogametech Just search for 3D LCD shutter glasses. You should get a few hits.
retrogametech Those are pretty ugly. I wanna try that one day though!
retrogametech Same here :) . I wonder how hard it would be to hack one of the wireless sets of glasses to work with the 3D adapter? That would be even cooler!
retrogametech looks good, glad you got it working
retrogametech Bad ass shit bro good job
retrogametech I can see this being used a comiccon not as an attendee thou, have it displaying something directly related to what your doing there
retrogametech Put a android tablet or ereader in it and put a bunch of game emulators on it
retrogametech What about fitting the engage innards with a big screen? Possible? It would look funny as playing it with big Kenny Everett hands!
retrogametech Hi mate richard here that cart in your gba are u selling it i have a ds light and.just ordered a r4. Cart for ds games but want one to play the gba games on the ds gba slot
retrogametech Any idea where i can buy this. Money is not a big problem
retrogametech hey, u have the same gba sp as Tweeterman287s XD
retrogametech I have this flash cart and I love it.
retrogametech I buyed one one year ago.Very nice...
retrogametech I used to have a GBA with a flashcart but nowadays I use a modded PSP, the battery lasts way longer than the almost dead battery of my GBA, and the game compatibility is actually better, not to mention all the other consoles I can also play with it.
retrogametech I agree, the gameboy games run flawlessly. The odd game like Shantae may not work but the vast majority will run perfect on the ez flash 4. Better than purchasing another flashcart for sure.
GameSack Im gonna be at PRGE, but I cant get all the way to Texas!
GameSack Just sold all my old systems, a part of me is sad and I always say to myself that I want to go back and play them, but I never really do. The few times I have gotten around to play old games, I just realise weve moved on so much and my childhood often gets ruined when I realise theyre actually bad. I remember loving MGS and it being my favourite game ever at the time, but going back........ just not a good game and I never even remembered it being only like 4 hours of actual gameplay lol.I miss my Dreamcast and N64 the most, but in reality Shenmue is just really bad and most N64 games have superior later versions. Goldeneye just isnt good any more and really Mario 64 and OoT have been surpassed and Mario Kart 64 is actually quite crap, Mario Kart 8 just looks so amazing.I have all these memories in my head of these games being amazing, I love watching them all back and remembering them, when it comes to playing though...... games today are a lot better, on the whole.
GameSack Cool, I live about 45 minutes away from Arlington.
GameSack Would love to go to see you guys, although I live in Australia, so that will probably never happen. Anyway good luck guys I hope things go well for you and you get to meet a bunch of great fans.
GameSack You guys are hilariously great. Visit the northeast sometime!
GameSack Maybe Ill attend something like this next year, would be cool meeting Joe and Dave. Ill have to bring my cheap Luigi hat for Dave sign ha.
GameSack Bring me the state of Texas so I can join in.
GameSack Dont take off multi team!!!!!!
GameSack Its been a few days since I watched this episode so forgive me if I am wrong. But I dont recall one platformer for this... platform. Were there any platformers for this platform at all? If so did you feature any in other episodes?
GameSack Sweet Video guys, NEO GEO cd is the last console I want for my collection!
GameSack Last blade was made by the same guy who made guilty gear and founded Arc Systems
GameSack Good one! Ending was nice, but it gave me a more extreme idea for an ad: The Neo Geo CD  Finally homeless bums can enjoy the 24bit power! :)
GameSack Id like to own a neo cd at some point, ive got AES and MVS in a candy cabinet. Prices are indeed out of reach for the most people on AES, but MVS is clearly the best option (just needs a supergun to be usable outside a cab). CDs just dont feel right for neo games, but then again its just my opinion. Still, a good addition to someones collection, its SNK hardware after all !
GameSack Dave and Joe both wearing Sega shirts... what is this world coming to?
GameSack Great episode guys! but I was surprised that KOF (King of Fighters) was not reviewed! was hoping or that game to show up. still I enjoyed the Episode :)
GameSack Another obscure system  another great episode! A bit fighter heavy, but hey, Neo Geo  what can you do? :)Ive picked up several of the Neo Geo compilations and Dreamcast ports released over the years, but I still have many Neo Geo games on my wish list. I figure either the CD or consolized MVS is my best option if I ever decide to go with original hardware.Had never seen Twinkle Star Sprites before  looks like an amazing puzzleshooter hybrid. Thanks for the recommendation, Dave!
GameSack 29:40 I got a story. Ahem! Today...I will tell you the story of the ThousandYearloading endsOh hey! The games ready!
GameSack So of all the comedy skits at the end of all the episodes... this one so far is definately my favourite!!!!!
GameSack Why dont these dudes have more subscribers??
GameSack Awsome guys, i really enjoy your show
GameSack Do you guys have Windjammers Flying Power Disc for the CD or AES? Id love to hear you talk about it.
GameSack Guys need to stop being girl characters, it gives me the chills... D:
GameSack Have you played, heard, or seen anything from the Densha De Go series?
GameSack Parodius Forever With Me is a great game! I like all games in the series! Hope to see them in your episodes!
GameSack You guys have the most consistent show on the internet. Ive been enjoying it for a long time. Now if only I could get me some of these Japanese games!
GameSack I like Daves hair because its like mine
GameSack I wonder if the Japanese ever make videos and write blogs about games being translated and released from the US market to Japan. I wonder if they even care.
GameSack Another entertaining episode that showed me a bunch of coollooking games Id never heard of. Id love to see my alltime favorite import, Blue Seed for the Sega Saturn, covered on one of these (assuming it wasnt covered in Left in Japan 1 or 2, since I havent gotten around to watching those yet).
GameSack I like Magical Flying Hat Turbo Adventure (MegaDrive)Psycho Fox (Master System, saw it also in the Master System episode, love this game)Wondering, if you will make an episode about the Sailor Moon fighting games, didnt saw it in the fighting game episodeAnd I missed the smurfs  Die Schlmpfe and Asterix (Asterix and Obelix) for Master System and MegaDrive in the mascots episode or with good or bad sequelsThey also didnt appear in the Western developed games episodes.I know, you cant talk about all games out there. So maybe we see some games from that in the future episodes. I am looking forward for that. Love your show. Great. Keep it doing.Thanks.
GameSack hell yeah parodius!! DO IT!! )
GameSack The only problem with the series are the hosts. I think they are into a different type of sack from a game one.
GameSack When they say about the cities not being of our own creation, could they not be referring to Humanity? As in these cities are made by the enemies in destiny.
GameSack Ya jaime collins did play some safety
GameSack Great vid dcoop! Youre a beast with Dansby!
GameSack Orgasmic I fapped to this all night. Good thing my playstation had the vibrate function. :P
GameSack What kinda wierd.... love is that? That made me feel awkward. but in a good way.
GameSack LOL the n64 is like faping to them
GameSack Aa errr u hmm hmm..scratches head
GameSack Dafuq did I just watch lol
GameSack Disappointed thought it would be some cool video games review. Still cool stop motion give you props for that . But stick to reviewing love your reviews
GameSack Jokes on you I still fapped
GameSack i just watched game system pr0n. mfw.
GameSack cant wait for the beta!
GameSack I totally had to turn my Ps1 upside down haha. i had 3 ps1s in the 1st year i owned one. luck of the draw. Great console!
GameSack Good video! Brings back the memories. Playstation started so many series. My favorite are Final Fantasy 7, Gran Turismo, Tekken, Twisted Metal.. and others I forgot
GameSack do the ps2 or original xbox
GameSack D: how the hell did you forget bloody roar
GameSack I actually played Total Eclipse Turbo today :o creppy
GameSack Ape Escape had to be the best PS1 game
GameSack you forgot them working with Philips sony backed out of the deal with Philips but Philips ended up releasing a system anyway even the it sucked badly
GameSack My favorite game on PS1 is Bushido Blade 2. I and my friend used to play that game for hours.
GameSack ohh my god did the playstation and a lower class nintendo system just have sex
GameSack Hat du bogg mit mir viedo zu machen
GameSack That skunk mascot sounds like he was made by some random Chinese video game producer.
GameSack Did these clowns honestly just say sonic wasntshouldnt have been a staple mascot? Theyll let anyone have a YouTube channel these days.
GameSack WHY DO U HAT DA 3DO, GEX IS ON IT.
GameSack I cringed so hard when he said you shouldnt buy ChibiRobo. If you actually play the game and just keep cleaning as a side extrapoints you can eventually have a battery that never runs out. The story is extremely charming especially when you travel through time with aliens. I understand that some people may not like the game but thats no reason to completely bash it. I personally really dislike Pikmin. does that mean its a crap game that nobody should buy?  No, Im fine with you saying its a failed mascot(even though they made a new game a couple months ago), but to say that you shouldnt even purchase the game even for cheap was far too extreme.
GameSack Hopefully Im not the only one who thought other things once he said fanservice ...
GameSack i love billy hatcher anD th giant egg
GameSack I dislike the video. Vectorman wasnt bad, but thats not the reason I dislike the video.You have a video that matches the same style as others. Seems like everybody just likes to kill games that arent very known. Dont dislike me. Thumbs up if you feel like almost every opinion nowadays is a copycat of another one.By the way, Vectorman wast forgotten. SEGA still puts it in their collections.
GameSack 5:15 theres plenty of fan service in this game...we clearly have a very different definition for Fan Service.
GameSack THATS CHIEF!! he also has a youtube channel! Watch him on twitch! hes hilarious!:) http:www.twitch.tvthechief1114 :D
GameSack No Super Metroid, or Chrono Trigger. Im done.
GameSack Not generally what I would choose but a solid list. Id have Splatterhouse, UN Squadron, Phantasy Star 2, Super Metroid, Bomberman 93, Valis 3, Super Street Fighter 2, Ninja Warriors, Chrono Trigger, and Star Control on my top 10 in no order. CV 4 is an honorable mention though. As is Final Fantasy 6, Bonks Revenge, Phantasy Star 4, Shadow Dancer, and every 16 bit Monster World game.
GameSack Some of my picks vary from yours therefore generic insult about your sexuality! But seriously Dave, Super Ghouls and Ghosts didnt surprise me at all since its awesome. People complain about certain rpgs not making your list, but if theyve watched even half of your other episodes, they would already know that you guys tend to like shooters and platformers more than other genres.
GameSack No Super Metroid?Loss of all nerd cred
GameSack best Game Sack opening ever
GameSack I remember to this day how i got CV4 my dad had bought it the day it came out and was his all time favorate game and gave me his copy when i was 4 along with the SNES (im now 21 and still have it) and i even have a tape of my 4th birthday and all you hear is the awesome music of the game as me and friends played it
GameSack Original choices, honorable mentions.... good stuff.
GameSack Wow these guys are faggots
GameSack LOL the dog from call of duty.
GameSack Nice list guys!! I agree with most of it
GameSack Surprised there was no Primal Rage.
GameSack Did i miss Shaq fu? )
GameSack BOOduhkahn? OoHow does one get that from Budokan??In Dragon Ball Z: Super Butden 2, Im pretty sure you can dash left and right with the L Button and the R Button respectfully.
GameSack gamesack is awesome x.x
GameSack i got that clay fighter for the snes you right that game gets old fast lol. great video best believe ill be there for the next video as well
GameSack love this episode, been a fan since day 1...I believe
GameSack Satuday Night Slammasters. Its a fighting game with prowrestling elements and it has Haggar from Final Fight. It also has a connection to Street Fighter.
GameSack Are you guys eer gonna do a Q and A episode? I think you guys are awesome yet I know nothing about you...So I have a couple of questions to ask you? Dave what is your favorite Nintendo game as well Sega game? Joe, you the same...Joe, Youve stated that youve been doing videos like these well into into the nineties, what motivated you to do videos now and why? question to the both of you? Who came up with the idea with game sack and why that name? What do you guys think of modern games vs retro games? By far what are your favorite game series and why?Alright...a little about me...My favorite system is the Snes and my favorite series is the final fight series, favorite character cody. my favorite Sega series is Shinobi (not including the ds version) I.ve always wanted to do videos but never knew where to start though I have lots of ideas...I love retro games for one reason, originality! NOBODY HAS ANYTHING NEW TO OFFER SINCE THE PS ONE ERA....with that said there are two series that stand out and they are God Of War and the M.G.S series, not including rising or Revengence or whate er.. Hey, i have tons of questions and few little time...Id love to hear from you guys though...
GameSack the dude in the turbografx shirt looks like his brain is made of bread.1:22 makoto from third strike?
GameSack Night Slashers was such a badass game to me when I was little, horror beat em up? Fuck yeah and then some :D Would love to see this somehow show up on PSNXBLA or anywhere possible for a rerelease
GameSack Hey guys, correct me if I am wrong but have you guys done a 3do episode?If you havent can you? Thanks love your guys show.
GameSack Ummm hello?! Battle toads WAS released for the NES...
GameSack There was Mat Mania a very old wrestling game I thought for sure was coming to the Sega Master System and Dangar a vertically scrolling shooter where you play the role of a robot that splits into 3 pieces then reassembles and if you get hit you become only 1 of the pieces and you have to gradually put yourself back together as you progress through the game.
GameSack I asume u guys used an emulator for this, which one did u use?
GameSack I have a suggestion. Have you guys ever played APB (All Points Bulletin) from 1987? Its a great arcade game and I dont think it ever got a console release. What a shame! :(
GameSack There was a game on the SNES called wild guns which seems very similar to blood brothers
GameSack most of those games are on home system
GameSack hey can you guys look for an arcade game that i played when i was young, but i cant remember the name. its a isometric shoot em up with repitlianlizardmen bad guys i think. there were different weapons you could get and i think you could even fly in some sort of ship. the landscape reminded me of levels in marble madness. also i think the title had a very scifi ring to it, kinda like planet of the lizard people in 3D or something. have you come across that ever? keep up the good work.
GameSack Sailor Moon game beatemup for mame !
GameSack awe sweetie. 3 Great vid as per the usual!
GameSack Fun and crazy gameplay to watch. Ill have to give action sack a try again (sadly since the TS reset action sack is my highest CSR lol). That doubles series thing sounds pretty awesome!! Id be interested (as a youtuber trying to get better)
GameSack New series sounds good. For the competitive stream, Id start sooner than your comfortable with since it would definitely be entertaining to see your evolution as a player. Most of us who play casually never think were good enough to play competitively. It would be nice to see how you manage the learning curve. Keep it up!
GameSack Ill do the series thing, but is it alright if Raps and I are on a team? Hes q YouTuber, Im a semi competitive player, we hell each other out, we get burgers, he comes back to my place, we get it on for the rest of the night with H4
GameSack That music at the end was the summer event music from FFXIV wasnt it?
GameSack Actually I ONLY watch your videos because it runs over 30mins., I just cant be arsed getting up every 5 mins to click on another utube vid. The Sharp X68000 was unbelievable back in its time, in the UK it was only ever talked about in the high echelon circles and most brits thought it was almost mythological, I am still amazed how it was able to cope with the later games better than SNES and GEN
GameSack The purple enemies in Return of Ishtar look like Grimace.
GameSack Can it use windows os?
GameSack I just have to say, you guys do a fantastic job and I always find myself eagerly anticipating your next episode!!! Great works guys!!......Ever thought of doing an extensive Mega man episode, reviewing all Mega Man games for all consoles? If it exists please point me there :)
GameSack I thought Id heard of every system out there and you guys pull this one out! Admit it guys you just made this up to fool smart asses like me who think weve seen it all! Awesome system and great video keep it up guys!
GameSack I love how big and intricate the game boxes are.
GameSack All gamesacks reviews are great but the Sharp x68000 is the best review you guys ever done in my opinion.
GameSack I wonder who bought this console.
GameSack I didnt think that death valley rally was that bad. A bit tedious in terms of platforming but was still enoyable
GameSack am i the only one who heard the music around 4:40 and thought it sounded like weird als dare to be stupid?
GameSack Cant believe you forgot Propeller Arena on the Dreamcast... :(
GameSack Joe and Dave  pleeeeeeease do an episode on Resident Evil! Like, you could do an episode on RE 1, then RE 2, then RE 3, code veronica, REmake gamecube and zero(but please dont talk much about 5 and 6)!! And maybe Silent Hill!! I want to hear your take on these classics!! Awesome show keep up the great work!
GameSack Dude whats the name of the background music playing before reviewing the first game ???
GameSack I do have Half Life for the Dreamcast, but I didnt know you can both use the keyboard and mouse!
GameSack You should cover Super Mario World 2
GameSack if there are more unreleased games. I highly suggest doing a sequel to this video.
GameSack Most of this games are better than the actual games!
GameSack Whats the all your base are belong to us from?
GameSack Wen smosh are in thes vids the get 60 thousands likes
GameSack 4th is the pockadot dress
GameSack Dumbest fucking gaming channel on earth, not even funny. I didnt even have to watch, and i know they are fucking stupid.
GameSack zombiewizard they do have xbox live but there friends list are full oo pss I stalk you guys smosh in your sleep. Jk maybe not oo
GameSack i would totally say that
GameSack you guys should do last one standing where everyone is against each other and trying to kill each other and the last one standing wins
GameSack Yay im only 3 levels behind Sohinki
GameSack the only problem is that I have a ps3 not 360 and I dont have a nextgen console either so I dont have a console that everybody loves so ill never be able to play with smosh games :(
GameSack Its not even a play ground Joven xD
GameSack Sohinki is like so calm during the game and joven and laser corn are like infinite rage
GameSack Now my retro duo portable is sitting in my box just getting dust. So not worth it
GameSack Glad your channel is doing well. You guys deserve it.
GameSack Id buy this if I had lot of cartridges lying around....unfortunately I dont
GameSack The PSP is able to this too but without huge cartridgesThere are also other handhelds that take Roms too and are way more convenientAlso android smart phones have emulators too, and they have controllers built for android
GameSack Does anyone know what nintendo 64 flash cart they have plugged in at 9:41? It doesnt look like the Everdrive 64, so what could it be?!
GameSack I didnt know that they made a Lego handheld console.LOL I still want one.I am surprised that they have not made a handheld that can play Xbox,PS 1,2 or even the Sega cd.That would be awesome! My two favorites are Sega Nomad and Turbo Express I can play all my favorite games on the go that I already own.
GameSack Are you guys planning on looking at the Supaboy soon? It seems that in terms of SNES games on the go, it seems that most people go for the Supaboy.
GameSack At 4:45 I couldnt stop laughing.This portable is now 3ft tall! Even the NES adapter is a bit much.
GameSack you guys are painfully unfunny. my honest advice is stick to doing straight reviews, honestly I wouldnt recommend selfdeprecating comments like calling your own videos moderately entertaining. If you dont care about the subject matter, why should viewers care. Better to be honest nerds, than nerds who try to be smartass but just fail and end up looking dorks and douches.
GameSack The music on the title screen of Super Mario Odyssey is a remix of Chronologie 4 by Jean Michel Jarre... I know because its one of my favorite pieces of music in history :)
GameSack European home consoles only had one button, so up would have been jump on them too for Rick Dangerous.
GameSack That Seiken Densetsu 3 is also 3 person multiplayer. But a great SNES translation hack is Tales of Phantasia which is still far better than the GBA Remake. Only thing the GBA Remake has is an extra character and nuances from Tales of Symphonia.
GameSack The English fan translation of hideo kojimas policenauts on ps1 is a must play particularly if you enjoyed snatcher
GameSack The best game is rick dangerous. I dont know if the gameplay is the same but if it is like the commodore amiga version, is definitely the best game. You should try it on the amiga and try rick dangerous 2.
GameSack How about Ultimate Mortal Kombat Trilogy the hack version of UMK3 on the Genesis.
GameSack Tonguemans Logic  Picross. Mario even got one on the Game Boy.
GameSack What music are you using using when you are plugging the flash cart into the console in the beginning?
GameSack LangrisserWarsong? Yes, that demands assume love. I suggest you also check out the translation of Der Langrisser for the family.
GameSack Butt Babies and Tranny Trans makes me want to vomit its so disgusting.

GameSack you guys realise you have 40000 million subscribers
GameSack Can this be used with BoR? If not can you make these attachments usable with BoR? My main has this helm and it saddens me I cannot use a cosmetic on my chest or a skin transfer on my chest piece.
GameSack Sack a fool, hire a fool.. Ah well. Can we break that like button? GameDevTycoon
GameSack Oh you guys! Its almost brave, these days to talk about sports games in the gaming community, but this is mother fin GAME SACK! This is gonna be awesome!Oh, and take the negative comments with a grain of salt, some people just cant help but talk crap and think too hard about reasons why something is lame or that something was forgotten.I know that you guys only have your own games to work with, so that can be somewhat limiting in some ways, but gosh darnit, you guys make the best of what you have, Ill say that.Thanks for uploading as always, your videos are just about the only thing I have to look forward to on Sundays.Much love from Canada!
GameSack i think tecmo bowl or super tecmo bowl is everyones favorite football game of all time even madden fanboys would say it is theyre all time favorite aswell

GameSack My favorite NES sports games were Blades of Steel (which lets you play Gradius during intermission), Baseball Stars, and Punch Out. I had NFL Quarterback Club on SNES which was fun, oh and Wayne Gretzky and the NHLPA All Stars.
GameSack All your episodes rock. How come my saturn controller looks different from yours? Keep up the good work.
GameSack What? No Mega Man Soccer!?
GameSack Wassup guys come check out some of my vintage game finds from the sunshine state! !!
GameSack my favorite NFL Football Game of all time isEPSN NFL 2K5
GameSack Was fr ne graka und was fr ein Prozessor hast du?
GameSack i love his reaction to alduin in the beginning
GameSack It would have been cool if they changed the top 16 to a tag team format. The last team will duel one on one for the championship.
GameSack Actually the draft process is interesting on the extra link, basically you open a pack, take one card and pass the rest to one dude next ot you while you recive also a pile of remaning cards fthat someone else got, pick one and pass the rest and so on every time the pile you will recive is smaller and smaller till no cards remains and everybody opens the enxt pack. you must pay attention wich cards you choose everytime and have a good guess of what everyone else is going to get from the packs. Its pretty much luck and be smart on pick your cards, but must than anything, luck.
GameSack I can argue with that. The stacks get passed around, so everyone gets a fair chance since you dont get to keep all the best cards from your pack, just one at a time.
GameSack Maybe if people understood what a draft was. A draft is this, a table of players gets a Booster Box. Each player opens the pack and takes ONE card and passes what remains of that pack to the player next to them. This is done until all the packs in the box are gone and every player has a deck that they can use. It is impossible to cheat with this and you are not given the opportunity to have all the cards in a broken pack. Seriously people, do some research before raging like infants.
GameSack sorry AznEyesWhiteDragon but drafting is NOT like a prerelease. in a prerelease you play sealed format meaning you make a deck out of the cards in the packs u get a draft is an entirely different format. You sit in a group around a table and then you all open your pack at once, then you each select ONE card and put it in a pile for ur deck face down. then you pass the rest of the cards to the next player! and continue this till all the cards are taken. this is a highly skill oriented format and you can not possibly just open good cards as you will only get 2 or 3 cards from the same pack and people will take the second best and so on before that pack comes back to you. this is good for the game, people need to stop blindly hating.
GameSack this is liked by every Dragon ruler haterits awful for the competitive game.What happens if somone pulls crap?my daswell quit now.
GameSack Except thats fucking wrong. Theres a difference between a sealed event and a draft event. Youre describing a sealed. A draft is where you open a pack, pick a card, pass pack to an adjacent player. There is strategy involved. You need to evaluate cards and take a guess on what may or may not come back to you.This has been a sanctioned format in Magic the Gathering for over 15 years with some sets designed TO be drafted. From Mirage (1996) to Modern Masters (2013), its actually been a thing.BREAD up in this motherfucker.
GameSack The website makes it sound like they arent just going to give them a bunch of packs, and that these guys have to build a deck using only the cards available inside the set.
GameSack You would never get multiple high priestess because you only get one ultra rare per box and you arent supposed to use it in the duel anyway its for you to keep and also they wrote like 10 articles on all the things they did to make it balanced so you should be able to use a decent deck so this is a good thing because it adds diversity to the game. DIVERSITY is the key word here.
GameSack David Jaffe had nothing to do with god of war 2, 3 or the rest of the games.
GameSack Scientists from around the world combined their skills while working with the Turbografx16 technology  thus Scientology was born
GameSack wheres kingdom hearts 2????????????????????????????????????
GameSack TMNT for the NES, Batman: Arkham series, Marvel vs Capcom, Street Fighter, XMen Legends, Fable, and Mario Kart.
GameSack Great as always, guys!I think Samurai Shodown II and Uncharted 2 were a couple sequels that were better than their predecessors.
GameSack Now days with DLC I swear they make the original game crap so they have room to improve during the next 12 sequels I never buy games nemore because they are all shit unless you want to spend another 4050 to get the entire game that you just payed 4050 just to play the demo version I like to call it cuz if you dont buy their dlc you dont get the full game
GameSack Der Langrisser for the SNES is better than Warsong for the genesis
GameSack I honestly think that Super Mario Bros. 2 (USA) is better than the original. The reason I think its better is because it has a little more to it than the original does, more landscapes, more characters to play as, new enemies (including some like shy guys whod make more appearances) and many memorable tracks to me.
GameSack Terranigma. Seriously, Soul Blazer and Illusion of Gaia are blown away by the third in this line...shame it was never released in the US.
GameSack Reuploadedi saw that before...
GameSack You guys are Freakin Hilarious!!!!!!
GameSack The last thing before my father passed away. she must have his soul because she still plays like a queen.
GameSack 0:36 DUDE! You touched the label with your fingers! (yes I am one of those who take the Neo Geo very seriously). lol, but its true you should never do that
GameSack I had a Japanese AES in the early 2000s, but unfortunately had to see it when I got into a major automobile accident and my car needed work I couldnt afford. I sold it at a gain though which was nice, but I still miss my copies of Fatal Fury 13, SamSho 13 and Art of Fighting 12
GameSack That was it? I expected more than just a short. I thought I was still watching the intro, but them the intro was the whole video!
GameSack You really need to do an episode on the neo guys! I have been waiting for it,! Nice taster though :D
GameSack Final burn alpha is the only way to truly play the neoego. I mean geo.
GameSack Medievil II. First of all it continues a story that ended perfectly and had NO NEED for a sequel. And on top of that it doesnt live up to the fun imaginative madness of the original by setting the game in 1880s London instead of the fictional kingdom of Gallowmere. Gallowmere let the developers create their own lore and a cast of wacky but awesome characters. Whereas Victorian London kind of limits them to the places and people of those times. Like Jack the Ripper. I am not bullshitting you Jack the Ripper is actually in this game. And hes basically British Freddy Kreuger. Also theres no longer a free roaming feel where you can do some levels in any order you want. Now the game is completely linear and only lets you complete the game in the order it wants you to. And finally it has a TERRIBLE ending thats not only a cliffhanger but also makes no goddamned sense and just leaves you saying ...what in the hell was THAT?! For the longest time I had II and not I. I am so glad thats been reversed recently. 3
GameSack No more Zelda 2 bashing! Foooools!
GameSack I recommend Blaster Master Overdrive on wiiware. Love the show Guys!
GameSack ExciteTruck good? ExciteBots not fun? Should have swallowed his Gamer Card, Joe. )
GameSack Its not called a ripoff if you take something from the same game (series) on another system.
GameSack Great video. A game that disappointed me a lot was GTA IV, compared to Vice City and San Andreas. I dont know if you guys play that kind of games, though.
GameSack Return of Strider. Also known as Oh God, Why?
GameSack Most of the reboot games have been disappointing. Castlevania, Contra, and of course, Blaster Master. Would rather just download the 8 bit originals.
GameSack I thought for sure Strider Returns would have made the list.

GameSack Oh my god I saw that monkey king game in the pawn shop this weekend for 3 bucks..........gotta get back up there tomorrow because they are closed on Sunday.
GameSack Ididnt knew that The monkey King on the Wii was a remake. And you are the first person I heard that liked Flashback on the XBOX.FF1  2 on the GBA were great remakes, and Metroid Zero Mission was one of the best remakes ever along with Resident Evil Remake.
GameSack But its The Legend Begins not The Journey Begins O.O
GameSack I was thinking you guys would just take a dump on Castle of Illusion and Duck Tales Remastered but I was kinda surprised when you didnt.IMO Many 2.5D remakes where bad due to the artistic ability of the artists doing the remake and how they where trying to ape the style while making 3D assets suitable for use on less capable systems. Neither of which happened with the aforementioned games in this post. Of course if you are a 8bit or 16bit purist nothing but a 1:1 to the original release would please you. But I quite enjoyed those remakes especially playing the PC versions at 2560x1440 with antialiasing enabled. If I could have those kind of graphics back in the day on those titles I would have jumped at it in a heart beat. I especially like how the original voices from the cartoon came back one more time for the Duck Tales Remake. I dont think I could ask for a better remake.And I say this as someone who sometimes still plays old games and has an interest in them.
GameSack For the record I agree that Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles was cheaply made believe it or not a hell of alot of other games are being made like that. Worst one is Mirror of Fate, Judgement, and Lords of Shadow its kinda sad really. It makes the puzzle game of Castlevania look better then anything.
GameSack Maybe Nintendo will do better on the 30th anniversary edition of Super Mario Brothers... I really hope so...
GameSack guys, I loved the cloud master vid, i never knew there was a wii version,now I will get one just to play it,thanks
GameSack A reason there are no black borders is because the tv wont autoadjust to a stretched wide screen.
GameSack As much as I liked Zero Mission, I felt the stealth mission at the end was completely added on just to boost the length of the game. And it didnt really add much of anything in my experience.
GameSack ich bin omnisprachfhig, um maximale verwirrung zu stiften :D
GameSack No one is blocking(screen pass?)
GameSack Whats the ending song?
GameSack Really awesome setting you had for the videoexcellent fitting music choice, as well :)
GameSack Tune in Next year for: Mario Doom, Starring Joe Redifer!
GameSack New episode of game sack!?! Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyeysyesyesyesyesyes!
GameSack Must be a damn good lay, that could explain a certain other character whos known for being kidnapped ....
GameSack great games recommended here! awesome video as usual!
GameSack The voice over in the New Splatterhouse sounds like the voice of cat from catdog. Im guessing its probably the same guy but its just weird hearing that voice say some of the things it does since Im use to hearing it be a little more innocent.
GameSack Rick loves Jennifer because shes a HORROR! Bwa ha ha!
GameSack Did you guys film that with Dave walking backwards? The SUV door and the wood as well as the way Dave was walking looked a little funny looking.
GameSack how did you actually get your name?
GameSack Aaaahhh! My colons empty now! lol
GameSack You guys really like stop motion...
GameSack your basement looks much more inviting now than it did in 2001
GameSack Dave hasnt changed much!
GameSack Alternate ending is better :)
GameSack I think our upcoming Halloween episode end skit is even better. less than a week before its up!
GameSack Also can we get this on like blu ray or dvd to buy episodes. Your episodes are so long I literally prefer watching it as traditional tv show.
GameSack Trivia: The room with the falling ceiling tiles and the rolled up carpet is where we currently make Game Sack.
GameSack man this guy really doesnt like a lot of games, and his because he doesnt like them he puts no effort, not really something thats going to make me a fan of this channel. later gaters
GameSack Lol the ending is great :D
GameSack Why u dont have episode about 3DO?
GameSack 7:07 they did have a proper sonic game that was a prototype for knuckles chaotixSonic Crackers  Knuckles Chaotix
GameSack 32x looks awesome :) i wish i could get one :(
GameSack Very helpful video. I recently purchased a 32x and this made it much easier to determine which games would be worth purchasing. I might have never bought Kolibri if it wasnt for this video. Thanks.
GameSack I never heard of the 32 X still this video.
GameSack sega suck the 32x suck. it was nothing but a somewhat high end 16bit system. sega took people hard earn money and went to the bank laughing. psone is a real 32bit system. snes is a real 16bit system that full of gimmicks. they tried to gain back fanboys trust with the saturn but psone shut that down.sega was always half doing it with their systems and the dreamcast was a bit to late when the real 128bit systems got release.
GameSack Huh...thought they released a looney tunes game about taz on the 32.
GameSack Ah a good dose of Kakujo and Narun. Always nice.
GameSack I looooved Ristar! I remember beating it back in the day, it was aawwweesome xDI dont think the voices were bad, they made him sound like an Alien which he is.And the spinny thingies were fun as hell, I really loved those too. Took some time to master maybe but when you got good they were just awesome.
GameSack jazz jackrabbit , crash bandicoot my fav childhood games
GameSack Perfect Dark for N64 needs a sequel.
GameSack Love Crash Team Racing. Many fun hours spent racing friends on it.
GameSack 50 fucking bucks for PowerStrike thats a rip off I would be pissed if that was me buying it
GameSack Katanari Damaci for play station 2, LSD for play station 1, bust a groove for play station, syphon filter for playstation. and some others i cant quite remember right now.
GameSack Do Evil Zone sometimes 3
GameSack Xexyz, Captain Skyhawk, Kid Chameleon, and Jackie Chans Action Kung Fu were all great games that needed more love. Id put music from JCAKF on mega man level of awesome.
GameSack avgn thought the boy got kidnapped
GameSack You are a great youtuber and you deserve that 1000 subscribers
GameSack I cant stop viewing the replay. The sack was so good.
GameSack I think Cam Wake is healthy now. Lol.
GameSack I love your videos that make my day
GameSack Can you start some other series?
GameSack Moyseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! rooneeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! dont careeee.
GameSack This guy was fecking right. Sack him, give it to Giggs in the end.
GameSack This guy is prick and its sad to see so much support for him.Maybe they werent wrong with saying that United fans are gloryhunters after all...
GameSack Moyes is crap better sign Reus in january
GameSack I blame the players not the managers theres no creativity. They have talent but no belief in themselves.
GameSack Sean said the same thing in his vid why does he receive hate?
GameSack Moyes needs a chance at least until the end of the season. Where we end up by then is yet to be seen but he wont last long if this continues. Would be amazing to see a united legend take over though like Solskjaer or Cantona etc.
GameSack United fans ask yourself this question did Fergie leave invest in young players or did he rely on an ageing squad to win the league? Now look at the mess.
GameSack Spot on, well said Andy
GameSack Nick Marshall will be doing the same thing after the Iron Bowl. Auburn doesnt realize that Bama has the best rushing defense in the NATION, and the run will do absolutely nothing against them. Bama wins the Iron Bowl, and wins the NC.RTR
GameSack That crowd is going HAM....
GameSack PerryCuda You Funny LoL
GameSack I agree with Gary. Good for Mettenberger to walk himself off. Roll Tide!
GameSack LSU was the better team this game and should have won handily. They knew LSU was going to throw the ball every time, of course you are going to get sacked more.
GameSack Love the coaches reactions after the sack!! AUsome!! WDE!!!!
GameSack looks like Heisman Pundit has yanked Manziel off their top 5 list as of 102113
GameSack Not very many of us in Knoxville are shedding a tear for Lane Kiffin. He threw us under the bus after getting us in trouble with the NCAA. Congratulations to USC for getting rid of him!
GameSack They should hire Pat Fitzgerald
