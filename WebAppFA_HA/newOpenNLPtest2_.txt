TopGear Now dont get me wrong I absolutely adore American muscle race lost from start I mean you picked Mustang A Mustang GT Against LOTUS What did you think going happen Sure Mustangs perform bit better than your average sedan coupe means sports car Theyre sporty car They were actually designed Muscle Car Light so could marketed towards female drivers Unless you get much higher price ranges than freaking GT youre going find good sports car unless individual modifications have been done vehicle But many people seem know I blame Ford thats part why Mustangs always leave bit sour taste my mouth The Lotus born bred fast above all else This wasnt competition "
TopGear First all why would you race against mustang The mustang muscle car sport car like lotus Yes may have more horsepower torque also more heavy than lotus I would preferred you had raced against corvette something similar I have feeling TopGear only makes fun American vehicles putting them against faster cars instead actually facing them cars fast "

screenjunkies I try take objective side debates like But guy first guy far left red shirt.My initial thoughts when I heard Reboot TNG were Just dont.Then after when I hearing reasons characters 0 51 1 10 I just wanted staple guys mouth shut.I havent seen breaking bad Ive got long list stuff watch from what guy says Heisenberg nowhere near what JeanLuc Picard character Maybe its my inner Trekkie from moment he started talking I could just feel rage bubbling up from my gut It wasnt bad rage passionate rage I love TNG I just dont want become something its Im midway through Tolkien movie crisis because Hobbit films pretty much shitting my hopes moment Maybe how star wars diehards feel "
screenjunkies Im sorry I cant see anyone else playing PicardPatrick Stewart ONE AND ONLY Picard "
screenjunkies Personally I think Cranston too old play Picard Picard younger when he first started "
screenjunkies The idea rebooting TNG terrifying especially its done terribly TOS Neither series needed needs rebooting perfectly fine The Abrams movies basically hollowed out poorly written soulless shells what Star Trek should always Whoever wrote abominations either had never watched Star Trek any meaning went right over heads DO NOT REBOOT TNG EVER Youve already fucked over pretty much every other Scifi series good go mess up Star Wars leave Trek alone "
screenjunkies Star trek never ever again star trek The star trek us real fans know love sadly sell simple minded majority who looking pretty explosions over top fight scenes drama sex appeal Anything name star trek future made those idiocracy mindset "

retrogametech It really varies game game Some look better without some One thing Ive noticed text clarity always seems benefit from scanlines Ive never seen official DC VGA box either I assume must pretty rare Its odd because SEGA went trouble marking VGA Compatible back many games Youd think theyd have promoted peripheral itself little harder "

retrogametech Odd That looks like same mess I had bad SNES board The games played too much color mixingcolors missing going "
retrogametech Most time devices low voltage dc If youre doing testing make sure board sitting something bare metal near cardboard pad something like rubber silicon mat Avoid touching boards themselves while while testing Very simple common sense things help you avoid getting shocked again hes dealing low voltage items usually "
retrogametech SETTING UP THE HARD DIP SETTING UP THE SOFT DIP "
retrogametech Best luck you man neo geos bitch get working especially AVS And hey you cant get work your could probably send LukeMorse from japan he pretty good fixing neo geos "
retrogametech I installed CR2032 my Pokemon silver cartridge I considered battery holder again I wasnt really satisfied I had keep using small battery I just guessed larger battery would keep my save file longer I mean same voltage twice size thus much bigger capacity If original battery kept my save file about 11 years new one should hit 1520 years mark quite easily.What I did cut old battery from its metal pins simple placed new larger battery those pins I didnt use solder cartridge case alone when closed aplied enough pressure keep place I did use one small strip electric tape keep larger battery contacts away from cartridge PCB though As I said before its tight fit cartridge kinda get little bulkier where new battery about 1mm doesnt do any damage cartridge case gameboy It still slides easily any Gameboy related product without ploblems its been working fine until now Ive done mod about 2 years ago "
retrogametech Pokmon uses batteries "
retrogametech Haha thanks dude Its one thing really bugs me about YouTube It doesnt matter how much research you do how careful you cover your bases how many times youve rerecorded video make sure you mention something youd previously forgotten theres always someone who seemingly just cant wait nitpick criticise Either just post misinformation try discredit what youve done You cant please everyone P "
retrogametech Do you need lot money invest your hobby I really enjoy electronics I enjoy retro gaming gaming general even more so Currently I have Wii PS1 Xbox 360 Slim Gamecube DS Lite crazy amount games consoles I dont have PSP Snes Nes Master System Saturn all those old consoles "
retrogametech No carts appear retain charge several seconds possibly 1020 I switched battery my copy Xtreme Sports while testing out mod surprised see my save still selectable next time I booted game So you should have enough time quickly take out old battery fit new one without losing data "
retrogametech Haha Larry Glad see youre giving support awesome people doing awesome stuff like "
retrogametech I really dont get how people can enjoy emulation They must have never owned systems when came out gbc isnt old im talking all systems Its all about nostalgia playing games actual hardware me Its like playing modern TV play games good CRT people throw perfect ones away you can get them free Just my opinion you can play emulator you weird stuff D "
retrogametech o forgot ask would work original gameboy games If smaller version holder "
retrogametech Excllent tip When you metioned battery you used I thought myself I wonder how many people criticise because shorter battery life People so predictable "
retrogametech you wanna sold some MODD XBOX heeheh "
retrogametech 200sex Tee hee I know its accent its kinda funny offence "
retrogametech Excellent haul man you know I like what you did yours better Buttons great all dip switches have great charm all themselves "

retrogametech Did you ever get working Ive done recent repair MV1FZ luckily I didnt have any battery acid stuff really painful I suspect you could have damaged tracks under components nearby often doesnt stop just battery area can damage tracks underneath chips easily "
retrogametech good vid dude always worth watch "
retrogametech Maybe trace coroded under DIPIC beside Battery The acid seems like spread underneath parts unfortunately "
retrogametech I would imagine PCB could multilayer board so you might see all corroded traces inside board Challenging project seems Good luck "
retrogametech This awesome I thinking days ago its nice know actually existed I wish I could have them hands "
retrogametech Lol thats good question "
retrogametech He got one from Ebay he said start video There video other one he has I think he mentioned where he got one from well "
