TopGear I put a my outboard on my dads car it work
TopGear Possibly one of the best challenges its a shame they dont do these still.
TopGear Hands down, one of the best TopGear challenges ever. Also one of the first I saw.
TopGear One of the best challenges they ever did!
TopGear Duh, it works. Its a ToyotaHonda. Why wouldnt work? lol
TopGear Lada was a cheap reliable car with no electrical issues and cheap on parts. Much more reliable than an overheating Land Rover and other overpriced crap. Im not a Lada man but but Top Gear should mention the price of the when was new.
TopGear I was expecting Richard Hammond doing this lol
TopGear James May can drift !!! OMGGG !!!!!
TopGear By the way, even a small Harley weights over 250kg, but close enough )
TopGear Is it me or was Captain Slow performing a powerslide? Hahaha... The Singer 911 is simply the best.
TopGear I love that they kept the same look if it isnt broken why fix it right? Such a nice car it has an aggressive stance i love it. I wish I could own one :(
TopGear Havent seen this show since series 12... Captain slow is power sliding?????! What has the world come to
TopGear If you can see, the numbers all go to 11, look, right across the board...
TopGear Goosebumps just by looking at it... its beautiful!
TopGear American tuning companies, making everything better than it was.
TopGear He made it look so easy
TopGear Is t just me... Or does it kind of look like a Pontiac GTO
TopGear I love the nissan silvia s14, it is my favorite drift car!
TopGear This car is basically the new version of the pontiac GTO right? I know they rebadged it from australia and brought it to america as the GTO for its brief reboot...
TopGear Jeremy Clarkson can Drift better..
TopGear More d1drifting please
TopGear Should have nissan skyline r34
TopGear holy shit thats the top secret 2001 s15. wasnt it totalled a few years ago?

TopGear Where do I get one!Honda Mean Mower World Record  Top Gear iPad Magazine
TopGear Hahahaha love the epic music special build up  one would think they are racing bloody spaceships  and then a 85 MPH vehicle hahahaha
TopGear The Stig has a world record.
TopGear I dont know why its so awesome but it is
TopGear How can a tiny lawn mower go 85 miles per hour?
TopGear The fastest Ive gone in a car is 110 mph, this fucker went 116 on a damn lawnmower, what am I doing with my life?
TopGear For me I think it would have a lap time of 1:10 or less.
TopGear That must have been an absolute blast to not only ride in the P1 but also get to go around the Top Gear Test Track which only a handful of people have ever done!  Great footage as always Docta! Cant wait to see more!
TopGear Awesome vid! I wish that couldve been me. It makes me wonder if Chris Goodwin is the stig
TopGear WOW! Such an amazing car. Definitely one of our favorites! Great video Doc. Thumbs up!
TopGear So the big question, is R8Pro bringing one home...?
TopGear it looks cool but cud this car beat a laborgini???
TopGear Top Gear Live 2014 Moscow 2014 Full  2014       !

TopGear Thank you for uploading this old Top Gear video! I used to always watch this when I was growing up :)
TopGear cmon.. get a dry lap in already..
TopGear wheres the under the hood part
TopGear Go for a GTR, think about the performance and way cheaper too than that 400,000 LFA
TopGear Not a single shot of under the hood
TopGear what did honda do in response ..... a lawnmower ... epic
TopGear Is it just me or when i see a video called under the hood I would like to see under the hood?
TopGear Are these footage really from my favorite TopGear show ? Common mates, you guys could have done much better than this crap video clip....It was very pathetic indeed.
TopGear Lamborghini Murcielago Roadster  Pamplona Bull Run

TopGear Top Gear 18x01 ITA HD Seconda Parte
TopGear who downloaded the game 1 this comment
TopGear I name this ship flush
TopGear Hahahahahaha...........
TopGear Cool I have this game on my tab!!!!!!!!
TopGear I play this game a wile and its pretty cool
TopGear Donr trick me into watching ads again thanks
TopGear non ti ringrazier mai abbastanza per aver messo on line le puntate di top gear:) davvero grazie mille!
TopGear Top Gear 20x06 ITA HD Seconda Parte
TopGear Just wait until they perfect the production of graphene as a superconductor. 90 less weight than those conventional batteries, holds a charge 5 times longer and charges in minutes, not hours. We are truly seeing the supercar of the future here.
TopGear Did you guys see what the subscribe button thing at the end said?
TopGear And the petrol? It will never run out.The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, and the Oil Age will end long before the world runs out of oil
TopGear So basically the SMS AMG is the smartphone of the motor world. Elegant. Snappy. But uses juice as efficiently as a Kool Aid pouch.
TopGear worlds first el car ????????? Have you ever heard about Rimac Concept one
TopGear German designed torches always better than others.
TopGear Its the size of a melon... Just found the funny!
TopGear Who else heard DeadMau5 ?
TopGear how much mileage you do with the electric one??
TopGear Oggi la carichi una nuova puntata?
TopGear Spero che i traduttori italiani siano andati a confessarsi dopo aver dichiarato che le 911 hanno 6 cilindri in linee a cambio manuale a 7 marce......
TopGear da 0 a 200 in 6 secondi!
TopGear Its called bonnet. Cars dont have hoods.
TopGear That Aston is one of the most beautiful cars in the world!
TopGear Better looking than any of its Lamborghini and Ferrari competitors yet it still has that everyday car feel to it. However, many Aston Martin owners are saying NEVER get an aston martin. Theyre not reliable. They break down easily and youll have them more days in the autoshop than you driving it. Its hella expensive to fix. So many Aston owners are say NO more aston.
TopGear That was dissapointing, I subscribed for BTS footage and extras, not to watch a pointless video that tells me the basic specs of the cars in your arsenal.
TopGear Stig standing in front of a GTR... Pretty much explains everything.
TopGear useless video..way too short and disturbing music. just my two cents
TopGear Ma Jeremy ospita sempre attori brutti ?
TopGear Hmm now lets see a race between a Hennessey Venom GT and an Aston Martin. Seems fair doesnt it.
TopGear R34GTRR35 Except winning wars
TopGear ford mustang is better
TopGear Lotus Vs. Mustang, in a 2 lap short track race. So fair...
TopGear Jeremy there is new Lotus Exige S go and test it!!!
TopGear a gt that was a rip off they should have gotten the cobra or shelby those are good racing cars gt are made for cruising
TopGear Why Jeremy is plastic okay for a British Lotus and not okay for an American Corvette ?Those autocross tires on the Lotus wouldnt last 10,000 miles. A few hard lap days and they would be done and worthless in the wet.
TopGear If the race was all on a straight road, the Lotus wouldve been in the Mustangs review mirror for miles til the end. Mustang is a hell of a good car with plenty of power but it doesnt offer a good handling as a Lotus because of width, weight and length.
TopGear fantasticoooooooo !!! grazieeeeeeeeeeeeeeee !!!!
TopGear Su D max queste puntate verranno trasmesse intorno al 2045. Grazie tante, continua a pubblicarle... Sono molto, ma molto apprezzate! :)
TopGear Ahahaha,il baricentro di un bruco!
TopGear pretty sure you could drift with no hands!
TopGear They find out that the river is actually called The Cock
TopGear I would take the McLaren. Since every blonde girl from LA with parents who have too much money drive the 458 it is not that special anymore. But since I dont have parents with too much money I wont get any of those :D
TopGear what was the Soundtrack or Song playing when Jeremy was driving ?
TopGear I havent seen what happened before yet but I would choose the McLaren. I mean, look at the Audi alone by itself in the city and it looks fabulous but put it next to these two and it just looks boring.
TopGear i love how the music for jeremys round is from ac3
TopGear I like what I just watched
TopGear where exactly was it filmed?
TopGear Whats the song that starts at 3:12 ?
TopGear SL63 vs Jag (same)Evo tester says they are both sloppy beasts on the track, was a bit of surprise for the cost and the looks of those. Sounds like M6 would waste them along with Panamara Turbo S
TopGear No, Chernobil id not fake. It is those three dimwits that are fake.
TopGear You guys should review the 2014 Corvette c7 Stingray... You guys may enjoy it.
TopGear Its going to be a sad sad day once they retire from the show.
TopGear Definitely just not enough episodes in top gear. I mean only 5 episodes in the studio? and then waiting 6 months or a year for 5 or 6 more. Id think being one of, if not the most popular show in the world, theyd make more of them.
TopGear https:play.google.comstoreappsdetails?idcom.datheumad.office
TopGear Call Of Duty 4. Pripyat.
TopGear Jeremy in the P1 vs. Richard in the 918 vs. James in the La Ferrari
TopGear Dont ever stop. You all rock.
TopGear EVERYONE stop complaining about short series. The deal Top Gear has with the BBC is 14 episodes a year. Has been like that for years, now will you all stop complaining and making stuff up?Also, what do you want? 100 episodes in a row and then Top Gear ends because theres nothing more to do, no more new challenges, no more places to make trips to, etc etc etc. Some people even already complain about the show losing quality, and that is fake and that is repeating stuff, and I bet most of the people complaining about so few episodes are the same that every week login to tg.com to say the show was shit.Please, just shut the hell up.
TopGear Sei un Grandeeee!!!! Io seguo Top gear dalle prime stagioni e sono un grande appasionato!! Il tuo canale  favoloso !! Ma non puoi caricare altre puntate ?? Se non mi sbaglio ci sono altre stagioni !Ma dalle 21esima in poi !
TopGear Ten leon ma wietne owietlenie. Przd jak i ty genialne i bezbdne
TopGear haha Jeremy got an LFA in dark blue like he said he would
TopGear No GT3 RS? I suppose Id take that F40 if I had to choose.
TopGear This Lexus LFA is really something, huh?What an amazing car!
TopGear no idea who she is still
TopGear Awesome cars Ferrari, Austin Martin, Alfo Romeo just plain awesome
TopGear garrrconnn LFA please. tyvm
TopGear Give me the Ferrari )
TopGear Top Gear 19x05 ITA HD Prima Parte
TopGear Maybe or maybe not, but one thing is certain. Your spelling is atrocious! The correct word is Braking.
TopGear I wish someone shouted BITCH during the interview !
TopGear dam hes prolly raking in the cash finishing breaking bad then goin straight to a big movie
TopGear damnit jeese stop goofing off and get back to work
TopGear Yeah, Breaking BITCH!
TopGear Jesse (the character) must be a shit driver simply by his choices of vehicles... at the end, his smiling ass should have stalled it.
TopGear I watched the episode. Hes now 1 on the board.
TopGear They should release Top Gear uncensored it would be even funnier than it already is
TopGear I think that these cars can go a bit faster than in the video,cant they?
TopGear Imagine a V10 or V12 in a ferrari 458, that would be insane
TopGear How did they get the whole airport shut down? Since Madrid Airport is huge
TopGear Check out this video on YouTube:w
TopGear Shouldve put the zr1 out there
TopGear review the Devel Sixteen and race it against a Bugatti
TopGear Grazie mille! Aspetto con ansia nuovi episodi. :D
TopGear purposely wet surface drifting is the gayest shit in the auto racing world... fuck AUS sucks sometimes.
TopGear Oh, puhleeze! You cant make a decent autoshow so you are going gaming... What os erong with you people
TopGear On windows phone awesome
TopGear I downloaded the game and I have all helmets, cars , double nuts and full upgraded powerups.

TopGear Its Monday and we have a brand new episode of FastLaneDaily for you!Learn about the new Koenigsegg One:1, Aaron Paul hits up Top Gear UK and a Nissan GTR Convertible could be yours!http:buff.ly1eNidt6
TopGear All this really proves is that you can hotrod up something until it will beat a Veyrons top speed. But the Veyron isnt a patchwork hotrod and its only trick isnt flat out top speed.
TopGear Amazing dramatic reading of that comment Mr. D!
TopGear Did he just say the one:1 is ugly? Nah fuck this guy and his stupid ass show.
TopGear how do u pronounce your last name Derek?
TopGear Need For Speed: Tokyo Drift
TopGear yea most likely will but it will never be as cool fast and the furious, what would have been cool is if PW was still with us.. some how the movies would merge into some kind of competition and be bigger than..
TopGear enjoy watching this week, keep it funny dude
TopGear he hit the 500 letter comment limit.
TopGear Czy przy normalnej jedzie, niskich obrotach auto nie mczy dwikiem?
TopGear This is the most glorious moment in all of Top Gear.
TopGear I just love the Seven 160. A dream to an 18 yearold...
TopGear I personally like the look of the car. However, the main problem of this car: no vase.
TopGear I reckon this Stig is at least 1.5  2 seconds faster than Ben Collins...
TopGear Such a nice track day car ! I really like that kind of cars ! :))
TopGear Stig has great reflexes.
TopGear Stig didnt seem to flog it to bad...you need Clarkson for a proper flogging.
TopGear james may is trying to say hes too old for this shit
TopGear The 160 is more like a GT86: simple, light and not a lot of power makes it a very good learning car. If James can drift it, anyone can. Same with the GT86.
TopGear there are a lot of caterhams at the nordschleife
TopGear Un mi piace  dobbligo! :)
TopGear I might have found out how to give my Subaru its final farewell. Top Gear drifts a burning STI around a poi performer. Oddly enough this weird combination seems quite beautiful in this ultra slow mo clip.
TopGear WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT
TopGear First time in my life , i dislike a topgears vid .
TopGear Pretty, but not very informative.
TopGear Burn you shitboxes burn! Hahahahaha
TopGear one of the best jobs I could imagine to do. Just let creativity flow through you.
TopGear Sitting in bars eating crisps. Nice!! Haha.
TopGear When did Johnny Sins start doing Top Gear?
TopGear More shots of dainty Stig with his umbrella please.
TopGear I dont recognize the badge. What kind of reasonably priced vehicle is that little red car?
TopGear Check out this video on YouTube:
TopGear Guys episode 4 of series 21 was freakin great!
TopGear plot twist thats a normal sized jeep
TopGear i had a honda commercial before this video.
TopGear i always watch Top Gear in english, at 1:06 i tought that language sounds so stupid...than i realised it was german, no wonder other countries make jokes bout our language.
TopGear I love the Spanish and Italian, just for sheer comedy. I also remember seeing Top Gear in German whilst on a school trip in Germany (and I only, vaguely speak French). That was interesting.
TopGear Hammond kind of sounds right in spanish. Jeremy sounds right in German and May in propah pucca English. Dont know if everyone will get what I mean
TopGear Latvian !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear I actually prefer the original sound with sub!!
TopGear Dubai isnt a country, its in the UAE well done for insulting them
TopGear Mexico!!!! In LOVE Top Gear
TopGear someone needs to brush his teeth lmao
TopGear This is why top gear is my favorite show ever awesome vid :)
TopGear Still my favorite go to the Atom
TopGear Fendered at the front, Open Wheel at the back, strange.
TopGear If I was a girl, Id like it very much
TopGear Some say that Stig is headless and Jemery wears his helmet.
TopGear No, i need an ipad, i couldnt watch this utrerly brilliant video without it!!
TopGear i want two...one in black on black matte
TopGear Spanish sounds like Argentinian and Spaniard! LOL!
TopGear Greetings from Mxico. Spanish dubbing is rubbish.
TopGear You didnt hear Estonian.. because we like see and hear the real thing ! So no stupid voiceovers, only a simple subs on the bottom! xD so cheers English language! xD
TopGear Actually I thought a little bit more about it and I think Jeremy Clarkson should be dubbed over with car sounds, and James May should be dubbed over with farm animals.
TopGear I think Ill just watch it in English LOL!
TopGear Im French,but i used to watch the French version,but not anymore,i simply cant get back to it,the English version is the best,end of story
TopGear I dont know what channel it must be on. But I would die to watch Top Gear UK here in the US
TopGear If you think that spanish is fast you should come visit where I live. Or just listen to spanish radio
TopGear Turkish voice actors are terrible! In every movie they are always the same and they pronounce very strange.... German and original are the best! Spanish and more spanish sound very funny and I wonder why they need 1000 words to say somethink very eazy xD
TopGear Spanish from Spanien sucks and the other lenguages too. I prefer just in english with subtitles.
TopGear I dont know, but the Hungarian version has a very similar voice for Jeremy. I havent seen this version.
TopGear happy to be norwegian... nothing is dubbed
TopGear it looks like it belongs in a mass effect game, its awesome
TopGear I believe the solution would be a helmet.
TopGear face like a ball bag!
TopGear Come ride this in Mauritius 95 Sun all year long!
TopGear Im french but I love it !!!
TopGear you didnt drive her during perfect road trip
TopGear My bladders gone! Its completely gone! Ive wet myself.
TopGear My goodness, Jeremy, please wash your teeth, theyre pretty much yellow!!!
TopGear I wonder if the military would allow the Stig to drive some of their vehicles around the track.
TopGear You know, now everyone knows
TopGear blablablablablablabla......
TopGear So did they get rid of the landrover defender in the british military completely...... Or do they still use the defender differently some how?
TopGear They should bring em back and then race them all. Would be a cool episode racing old vs. new or something.
TopGear the only thing i DO know is that there is an awesome looking P1 in the back
TopGear Well.. thats a video full of nothing.
TopGear Under 1 million club!
TopGear What does RS stand for?
TopGear Che bella la aston! Ma davvero metterai anche la serie 20??
TopGear What kind of driver would Loki be? I can see it now......Thor would just be sitting there on the side of the track looking all giddy, trying to give Loki all of his support but screwing up royally. So Loki, how are you enjoying your trip to Midgard? Are you anticipating being broadcast on the driving program on the humans magic picture box? And then Loki would just sloowly turn and glare at Thor for causing all the rain and wind and mutter through grit teeth, You cant even comprehend the immense hatred I feel for you right now.
TopGear Loki driver(excuse me!!!!...only I say: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA) ...HAAHHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA...In the film is BAD...in the road is MANY BADDDDDDDDDDDD!!!! haahahahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahaha
TopGear how adorable is he..in his glasses....them plus the helmet.. i almost didnt recognize him ...
TopGear maybe its raining because Thor was suppose to be the star in reasonably price car, but Loki sneak in, so he create all the wind and rains ?
TopGear Watching Tom Hiddleston made me forget about The Stig, No Stig, no problem, Mr, Hiddleston provided the magic.
TopGear No wonder it rained so much: Thors jealous
TopGear Wow. I have to say that I am immensely impressed by Toms driving skills. Not only is he sexy and the god of mischief but he is also a driving god. Wow. Mind has been blown
TopGear According to the Guinness Book of Records, Top Gear is the most watched factual programme in the world, ever. Oh, and Loki is the only good thing about Thor2...just to get on his good side. :P
TopGear Halos.com. YouTube: CSE01 Age of the Earth (FULL) Kent Hovind Radiometric Dating Flaws Kent Hovind Our Solar System: Evidence of Creation. Google: Science vs Evolution Pathlights. If your dreams dont scare you, theyre not big enough. YouTube: F18 vs. SAM.

TopGear I couldve sworn it was blue...
TopGear At least its nota. Prious guys
TopGear that is the fastest car in the world it can beat buggati veyron supersport?
TopGear Stig has Portugese accent
TopGear Hugh is joking, stig is Gordon Shedden  but I like to think hes not human as a bit of fun
TopGear I initially misread the title as Bonneville Behind the Scenes and was thinking Theyre at the Utah salt flats? Interesting. Then I looked at it again. Oh.
TopGear The stig is intimidating
TopGear I read his name as Huge Bonner
TopGear sono dei geni sei un grande grazieeeee
TopGear 272 people treats money as a requirement for the universe to exist
TopGear Awesome performance. This must be Clarksons idea. How does the 911 not explode?

TopGear Haha love the A Martin comment hahahahaha! Anyway they are going to advertise whoever pays them u know? Hyundai and Kia lmao haha.
TopGear Disappointed this was not a guide to which watches the top gear presenters wear them selves. Im always trying to catch a glimpse of what theyre wearing, sometimes some interesting pieces, especially Hammond.
TopGear I would like to know what your personal collection consists of.Also, what do you think of A. Lange  Sohne and where does it rank relative to the top three?
TopGear oris? is that a watch brand? hoho...
TopGear Hey Archie, thanks for the informative videos and the sparkling personality, love it!! Quick question, can you recommend a good online watch shop with a solid reputation? Obviously, authenticity and completeness of the timepiece (box papers ect.) are the greatest importance to me. Thanks!!

TopGear holy shiet i want to see what happened with Hammond!
TopGear The stallion tried to mount Jamess horse?Was expecting Clarkson to make a joke about the Stallion seeing one horses ass on top of another.
TopGear ohh god I miss the show , I am stuck with the usa version.
TopGear Holy moley! Why do they have 5 legs in Burma?Maybe it so it can milk itselfLOOL
TopGear jessuss.. i mean.. budhaa.. LOL haha
TopGear You guys r so horrible, you arent supposed to get to close to the horse infront of you...... not to mention, ur so heavy for those horses or maybe more like ponies.
TopGear Make more cycle lanes...keep cyclists in them, keep everyone else out of them...problem solved.
TopGear What episode is this?
TopGear The only thing i think is unfair is if a cyclist was to hit your car, you have to claim on your insurance, loosing your no claims for something that wasnt your fault! If they are on the road, they need some type of insurance!
TopGear I honestly never thought Id see Jeremy on a bicycle! xD
TopGear Work harder get a car lmao

TopGear Top Gear started the entire Crimean Crisis. The colors they chosen are the ones of the Russian flag, and they showed up in Ukraine like that!
TopGear I have seen the full clip, butHow do you achieve those airshots above the buildings ?who was holding the camera ?and why did the camera man did not stop recording or at least yell out when Jeremy ran out of fuel ?a nice clip but some details there are a bit strange.
TopGear Typical Have a war around broken active atomic power plants, thatll stuff up the ecosystem and take the fogg of Fukashima and who built that one.

TopGear this episode was great
TopGear Graham should get all his guests drunk  they are much more entertaining. This episode was absolutely brilliant!!
ZONEofTECH Tehnically, yes, you are a YouTube partner but be careful. Many people will tell you youre not a true YouTube partner. Full partners have branding and thumbnails and other things like that. also, as a heads up, you wont make too much money from this till you are a full partner. I hope this helps!
TopGear ?         Top Gear.       ?
ZONEofTECH Great unboxing! I didnt realise the game was 5 years old!! Great bid!
ZONEofTECH i really like the box art of this one.

GameSack Not anymore. Just tried it with a shit ton of AP... its true damage so it blows right through his extra armor and stuff he gets while meditanking. :(
GameSack Yeah but its 9999 health. IT doesnt show the other 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 health in the bar. The nexus also has to be destroyed.
GameSack now it takes true damage so it doesnt matter if you have 10m armor or 0, the only thing that matters is HP
GameSack BTW, you can turn off Key Clicks at the setup in ventrilo!
GameSack beep, blurp. beep, blurp. beep, blurp. Its the sound of you not having friends to play LoL with.

GameSack musiqaddict veigar is VERY far from OP while EXTREMELY strong when built right he has EXTREMELLY weak armor pretty much his only protection is stunning with event horizon so you can run away lol
GameSack I once had like 680 AP o.0
GameSack amazing how he uses his Q spell befor his W makes his W fail much ...

TopGear How do u put 3 clips together as 1?
TopGear Also you could cut it down to 7 episodes per series like top gear and please do an episode where you all have cheap hatchbacks or stationwagons and you go on a journey doing various challenges
TopGear love the crazy 60s racers, great addition..but wait, why is there no shift animation?
TopGear Its now out for non season pass holders as well!
TopGear So glad I didnt get Xbox One or FM5
TopGear Man I just wish theyd give us the recycled ones for free, and then give us 5 new cars every month rather than have us pay 10 for 9 recycled and 1 new.
TopGear To me this pack is not a great car pack nor is it a terrible car pack it is just another meh car pack... I wish people would just stop hurling insults at others based on their opinions of something, its plain silly, opinions are something everyone has just because it doesnt necessarily agree with your opinion doesnt make it right or wrong it is just their thoughts on something, that is aimed at both the rabid fanboys and the people who are on the other end of the fanboy spectrum....
TopGear If u make a new forza dont let top gear pick the DLC cars
TopGear I dont think I will bother buying an Xbox one or Forza 5 as so far from what I can see they are just using all the same cars as Forza 4. So I will stick with that and save myself 400 odd in the process. Shame on T10 and Microsoft way to put off an avid fan of the franchise :(.
TopGear ingame engine footage. very misleading. also, most of these cars have nothing to do with top gear.. lol
TopGear Wow I really want this pack! Thanks Turn10!Said no1 ever...
TopGear I thought this was the TOP GEAR pack. Where is all there wacky creations?
TopGear Bout time the R390 showed up
TopGear Cant see if theyre real or not. Jelly of xbots now
TopGear 34 of those car i already have on forza 4... but i still want the 5 :)
TopGear I understand the Ford Transit as a joke, but a Hummer ? Really ?
TopGear These graphics look like real life sometimes. Its only that the cars are super shiney and clean
TopGear Not playing my forza 5 again until they put the carrera gt in this game
TopGear Even though weve already had the majority of these cars previously, for the first time its a good group of cars
TopGear Is Forza 5 only for XBOX ONE?
TopGear Third :D Didnt to see the whole stream.
TopGear I hate cheaters and lairs so next race just choose someone else
TopGear I NEED IT NOW I NEED A RIM JOB NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear My dad had a 82 camaro a blue one dark blue
TopGear you look, sound, and act like me... this makes me uncomfortable

TopGear Failrace vs the community in R1 cars

TopGear Top Gear Challenge Best Car For Teens
TopGear la puntata che provano la ford fiesta st l hai gi caricata???
TopGear Technically only the dude that brought the ISF won because its the only SEDAN!
TopGear no they not they wavy
TopGear Would anyone who has played this say that the graphics  physics are kind of like Forza Motorsport 4  Forza Horizon  Forza Motorsport 5?Because to me as a viewer thats kind of what it looks like.
TopGear Why would u tune the cars...Now its not best car challenge but best tune challenge..
TopGear .....GODDAMNIT. THE CONSTANT SCREECHING OF TIRES.... Who the hell is doing that, HOW ARE YOU NOT KILLING EACH OTHER?!
TopGear I love your yellow controller xD

TopGear Awesome! That explosion was a great touch. Haha
TopGear Sub in Resonably Priced Car?
TopGear What a brilliant episode! Thank you so much for letting me be included, I really enjoyed it! Editing was superb, just sublime :)
TopGear Hello guys! Ive been watching since the first episode. Ive been wondering if I would be able to apply for a position to be your permanent 3rd guy. Im nature and know alot about cars. Ive watched every season on top gear so I know what Im doing.
TopGear I got spin tires and I need help putting deep and sticky mud on. I have put more trucks on. But dont know how to put the mud on.
TopGear Haha thats a sick challenge! I suggest a drift car challenge. I made a vid with my challenge, you should check it out!

TopGear Your car was the best ar12gaming
TopGear Tht Syclone WAS BEAST!!!
TopGear my mom owns a g65 amg
TopGear xbox record that, xbox record that, xbox FCUKING RECORD THT
TopGear E outra: A mensagem What the Heck no Japo  What the Hell
TopGear I quite remind this game. Actually it was one of the last titles i hear about what was released here in Portugal before the N64 disappear in the shadow and the beginning of the release of the Gamecube as well. The N64 didnt have a good impact to be honest. In over the past last years, i think this game make a good feedback even to the graphics limitations.
TopGear I saw this one on my flea market hunting today, but passed it over, as the reseller was an asshole, and would not come down on the 20US he wanted for it(same seller also wanted 15US for a copy of GameBoy Tetris LMAO!!!), but did score Pilot Wings and Ready to Rumble Boxing for 5 off another lady. So if i see this game for a good price I will make sure too give it a go.
TopGear i played top gear on snes and i liked it. this one looks pretty cool
TopGear Not enough speed for the grip that, that FRS has
TopGear L, sei bellissima in questo video e il makeup  stupendo ogni volta che guardo un tuo video penso: dai romy,non aver paura..buttati e fai video anche tu!!! ) poi permi freno (Un bacione tesoro :
GameSack Eternum Nocturne is the BEST! All hail this SHIT !
GameSack That was such a hype week
GameSack This was the first thing I heard when i logged into league of legends. I was like, WOW THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE AWESOME!!!
GameSack The reason I love this song is because it sounds like a teemo in a supersonic washing machine.
GameSack Feel like want to hide in bushes and stalk the people.Pack up weapons and leave
GameSack Tho Rengar has been nerfed, i feel like this music always brings him back alive.
GameSack Yea some guys washing machine inspired this song.
GameSack Best moment in lol history when this bad boy came out
GameSack Kinda Transformer style.... Epic song, but I still think PFEzreal theme is the best.
GameSack got my first penta kill on jayce today. had to come listen to this song XD
GameSack Am I the only one who thinks this sounds like the Dark Knight?
GameSack i he gets adds on videos that money that people gave to him helped to make he shouldnt get the money for himself cause that is like asking for money to make money and never payback
GameSack Tbh the giveaway was just a plus for me, considering i was already subscribed
GameSack Freddie seems like the kinda guy that would donate some of the money to a charity or something along those lines. Dont think he would just keep it all.
GameSack Lol at the blooper xD
GameSack 2:50 misspelled freddiew
GameSack when I saw a new youtube News I was planning on commenting that Steve should be in it... luckily I dont have to..
GameSack Riot is simply saying subscribe, we give you free stuff. Phillip Defranco does it, EVERY DAY. He isnt all, just the most notable.
GameSack YouTube never inforces their terms of service when it comes to partners who make lots of money for them.
GameSack Steve  Will. The greatest odd couple on Youtube ever.
GameSack Hey Will awesome show once again, i love YTWL! hope you have agreat weekend!! 33
GameSack She isnt steve greene...
GameSack I still dont get the set: a bit of green screen, a bit of the room and the table. wtf?
GameSack at times i get a good laugh out of Jennas videos but its just not enough for me to subscribe. things are getting weird with the people going up the list of top 100 out of nowhere... i want the awesome youtubers back. like lets say i dont know...the vlogbrothers maybe?! livelavalive maybe? just saying.
GameSack Great now I gotta find spbadbuys comment
GameSack so shes Canadian AND Jewish??? Marry me???
GameSack Your set is awesome Will. I remember back in the day when it was you in your bedroom with an excel spreadsheet!! Keep it up (:
GameSack great that youre upping the prod value!
TopGear this is madness the narrow street
TopGear Haha good old clarkson ) as for the bitch sueing the bbc I think you should fuck off, to put it bluntley. Hammond was pointing to the other side of the bridge. Just another over reaction by some pompous bitch. Funny joke. Pissed my self laughing when I heard it and wish to see more of clarkson, hammond and mays jokes on future top gear series .
TopGear Whats wrong with harmless jokes this is why I hate the modern nanny state when you cant say this you cant say that they cant just police free speech plus only a few people complained so why should the media give a fuck
TopGear i dont get it whats wrong in it
TopGear Lexus LFA is no more better than 2014 Nissan GTR or AMS Does this mean the LFA isnt any better than the GTR or AMS? If so id like to add that it is in fact worse from an owners perspective.Lexus really doesnt like people to know this but, you cant actually own an LFA. You are essentially just a long term lease holder that paid the entire lease up front. I guess its really just a 2 year waiting period before Lexus will let you be a big boy real deal owner. The GTR and AMS you can actually 100 own from day one. ipso facto they are better.
TopGear More like 90 of freight!
TopGear If it is Adam,huge fan!!! fuck the BBC. and Jeremy Clarkson. Americans do get the show. fuck those assholes forcancellation. they definitely did not promote the show properly
TopGear Would subscribe if you dont mess with the voices

TopGear first topgear ive ever watched more interesting than uk but uk has super and hyper cars
TopGear The trick is to lower the air pressure in the tires.
TopGear Its funny because the film crew an the rescue crew are in Toyota helixs
TopGear Toyota Hiluxs with the film crew got there first. And they probably got those from the original and best version from Britains top gear garage.
TopGear Yall have changed the voices so much its not watchable
TopGear Ha, selena gomez mp3 showing in the tesla :)
TopGear It sounds like theyve been doing whip its hahaha huff the nitrous boys huff it lol
TopGear The first car which is shown on this programme looks like a rip off a Jaguar XK220
TopGear Tanner is a drifter. So what. Hes an arrogant 53 punk. Adam is an actor from New York where everyone takes a taxi. Rudledge is a cool, nice genuine guy.
TopGear american cars really r no good 4 anything
TopGear Vertical video is a sin.
TopGear Uhm, I dont understand english very well, anyone can transcribe what James is saying at the end?

TopGear What song is that in the very beginning? I MUST KNOW
ZONEofTECH Btw, this is my 300th video :DHopefully it is something youll all enjoy :)
ZONEofTECH Part of this video seams very familiar...
ZONEofTECH And i hope the iwatch does what other smart watches do, which is just to be a companion to your iPhone where you can get alerted on texts and calls and maybe make few without having to take out your phone and a button that you can press to find your phone would be nice. Anything else, like the health book, would be extra for me.
ZONEofTECH Solar seams the most practical
ZONEofTECH Lol he looks like spider man...
ZONEofTECH apple is switching to gorilla glass
ZONEofTECH Is that a bit of repeated footage on the sapphire I think it is
ZONEofTECH You look like Andrew Garfield
ZONEofTECH whats the name of the song starting at 13:42?

ZONEofTECH Great effort in putting leaks and rumours together!
ZONEofTECH iphone creators should think about gorilla glass i had a phone the droid razr and i dropped it on its face and it was also dragged and the only thing that happened was little dents on the corner of the phone but nothing to the screen
ZONEofTECH You look like Andrew Garfield
ZONEofTECH i think the tKLET WOULD BE called itablet
ZONEofTECH Ive heard rumors that wireless charging is extremely inefficient. Like those rechargeable toothbrushes that use electromagnetism or whatever, its been said it isnt efficient. For some people that isnt a big deal but as a college student paying my own electric bill, this could be a factor. It better have a lightning charge option.
ZONEofTECH I didnt come here for almost 20 fing minutes of music.
ZONEofTECH 20:28 is when the video actually starts to matter.
ZONEofTECH 26:20 My reaction changed.
ZONEofTECH galaxy s5 a keen disappointment

ZONEofTECH Nice video, I actually own a 4S 32gb and Im trying to see if its time to change it for a 5C! Im satisfied with my 4S but I like very much the 5C design. This was very informative, but Im still in the process of what to do. However Ill probably wait until they announce the iPhone 6, which I dont think Ill buy cause its gonna be too big for me, then ill buy a 5S instead hoping on a cheaper than now!

ZONEofTECH Apple confirmed that at the 2012 iPad 3 event. The A5X is 3x more powerful than the PS3. Since the A6 is more powerful than the A5X, its obviously more than 3x more powerful than the PS3.
ZONEofTECH The Cell processor is single core with 6 SPEs. They act behave like CPU cores but in fact theyre not. Theys just CPU processes, thats what they are. Anyway, the GPU is the one that matters in gaming, not the CPU. The A5Xs GPU is 3x more powerful than the PS3s 550 MHz NVIDIASCEI RSX Reality Synthesizer. Conversation ENDED.
ZONEofTECH He is copying Steve jobs when he saysbut theres just one more thing... Annoys me, RIP Steve
ZONEofTECH You know the most thing i respect about you that you always replay to any question . cheers From Mr white :)
ZONEofTECH I actually thought youre 22 or older, cause the way you talk and know a lot of things with your age. :D im the one who is going to be 17 haha :)
ZONEofTECH Oh thats cool :) Mine neither! Im from the Philippines, but I know live in Austria.
ZONEofTECH ok, my mommy always told me not to say anything when there is nothing nice to say, so im not gonna say nothing...
ZONEofTECH you failed nursery exams, maybe thats why your grammar is so bad, you say swear on me mum instead of my mum. dont worry, im sure you will make you mommy proud when you pass. just try hard and concentrate in your nursery class and you might just get through!
ZONEofTECH iOS 7 will be released on September 10, and the new iPhones will be released on the 17th, the other products next march.

ZONEofTECH I have used to my galaxy s4 for professional photoshoots and my models have loved it but I need to get myself a DSLR to expand my repertoire...
ZONEofTECH FYi  there is no such thing as digital zoom. It is a marketing gimmick for cropping the image... Which gives the illusion that there has been some zooming going on. There isnt.
ZONEofTECH Nothing bad about plastic phones
ZONEofTECH i think the cc stans for colour
ZONEofTECH good feature, i use it on mine, but they are not very accurate, as its built into a phone that gets hot regardless if you are holding it.
ZONEofTECH Cant you do that with s3 ?
ZONEofTECH whats up love the vids
ZONEofTECH I didnt know Andrew Garfield made howto tech videos...
ZONEofTECH Hey if you ever get a ps4 or Xbox one, will you do a unbecoming for that?

ZONEofTECH OMG I LOVE YOU !!!! THANK YOU FOR THIS VIDEO!!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH SIMPLISTIC OVERVIEW  DOES NOT WORK IF THE IPOD IS STUCK IN RECOVERY MODE
ZONEofTECH According to the comments none of your subscribers have a sense of humor. Except for me! :)
ZONEofTECH Dude its not first look.
ZONEofTECH t phone is black t rest is white?wtf?
ZONEofTECH Its, how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood. Just saying.
ZONEofTECH I have it installed on my iPhone 5 and iPad mini (thanks to you!). Loving your videos!
ZONEofTECH i have iOS beta 1 but it says my software is up to date. help me please ):
ZONEofTECH it said im already on IOS7 :( I dont see the IOS7 beta 2
ZONEofTECH Ok I downloaded it fine but whats ups the worst battery life Ive ever seen in my phone it drops like a whole percent every 3 min and more if Im playing games. I dont leave apps open
ZONEofTECH I was in my Bat Cave, sorry about that :) iOS BETA 2 hasnt been rolled in all the countries yet :( Where do you live by the way?
ZONEofTECH Waiting for the iPad video
ZONEofTECH Restart your device to check again
ZONEofTECH Anyone have the ios 7 beta 3 not notifying people when you have a text
ZONEofTECH but what happens if i already updated my device to ios7 Beta 1, and when i go to software updates, there is no available software update for ios7 Beta 2? what does it mean?
ZONEofTECH Better wait until full version come out for free. iOS 6.1.3  6.1.4 best presently . Please, dont update right now  dont loss your data apps .
ZONEofTECH I figured it out. You should get one... very nice
ZONEofTECH No, unfortunately I do not have one. I might get one pretty soon so stay tune for that :)
ZONEofTECH the tabs feature is on linux for ages.
ZONEofTECH I think Samsung is actually pc Thayer
ZONEofTECH In my opinion I dont see what the big deal is with finder tabs. A lot of other programs already have it.
ZONEofTECH Well that about sums up the PS4 vs Xbox One battle haha
ZONEofTECH looks like a trash can...
ZONEofTECH Note: mey need a restart. New accounts with no cards are made when you try to buy something free from the app store.
ZONEofTECH Whats your phone model? 4, 4S? Also what iOS7 Beta is this? For some reason all the betas Ive installed before on my 4 are sluggish.
ZONEofTECH Nope, the icons move as well. Only the lock screen elements stay in place. I did show this in the video. 6:36 pay more attention to the video
ZONEofTECH Just for future reference you have it backwards with the new dynamic wallpapers. Its actually the wallpaper that moves and the clock and apps stay giving it the 3d look.
ZONEofTECH no way ,.. fuck it ..you are a fuckin loser .. apple is not singing ios 6 any more.. fuck fuck fuccckkkkkkk !!! im in a fuckin ios 7 and i need to downgrade to unlock my fuckin device with ultrasn0w and the only way you can downgrade ios 7 to ios 6 is with shsh blobs .. and I FUCKIN DIDNT save themmm .. youu know what ? everysmart phonee SUCKSSS !!

ZONEofTECH Hold Shift while klicking on it!
ZONEofTECH Ok so mine still has the same black background and white apple when it is installing twice. And it stops at like a small part and doesnt move after that. Please Help.
ZONEofTECH Most likely your iDevice is not compatible with iOS 7
ZONEofTECH Most likely your iDevice is not compatible with iOS 7
ZONEofTECH where is the link man
ZONEofTECH For all of you that are saying firmware not compatible: There are two types for iphone 4, CDMA and GSM. look on the back on your iphone at the model number. it should be something like, A. If you have an iphone 4, and the model number A1349, you have CDMA. if model number 1332, your GSM. Go back to the beta download page and click the right one and download again.
ZONEofTECH Do you have to restore your iPhone??
ZONEofTECH how long does the ios7 download from the mega beta site take?
ZONEofTECH How does my itunes radio just dissapear...
ZONEofTECH i dont like how icloud is in all my songs.... how do I get rid of it or is it on there for good now. anyone know yet? that has to be my only complete about it. grr
ZONEofTECH Yeah this site is just sending out free White Apple iPad 3s for today only. You have to be fill out your address but it is legit, I claimed my one a few minutes ago. Better hurry up! UPAD3.COM If the next car passed is blue, Violet will be okay, she thought. If its red, A will do something horrible to her
ZONEofTECH No, unfortunately it is only available in the US at the moment.
ZONEofTECH Garbage bin ..lol....build a better PC for 12 the price
ZONEofTECH Mac pro: Overpriced, Underpowered for the price. Bad cooling. Horrible cooling. Dangerous cooling. Relies on thunderbolt. Yeah i think ill build my own hackintosh windows pc.
ZONEofTECH Shiller: Cant innovate anymore, my ass. Can someone tell me what about this machine is truly innovative?
ZONEofTECH I think apple was trying copy the Sbeam feature
ZONEofTECH Nobody in my country has a windows tablet
ZONEofTECH how many different phones have standard bluetooth or NFC? Now how many phones have compatible Airdrop?
ZONEofTECH IDK boy but the guys sad it uses WIFI so yeah pretty much useless android has an app for that. But if I understud it wrong then its pretty cool
ZONEofTECH How is this more useful than basic bluetooth? To use airdrop between phoens u need an iPhone 5 running iOS 7. It doesnt work with iPhone 4 and wow u just assume everyone has one same phone? u need an iCloud ID, and then u need to turn on bluetooth and wifi, am I correct? Can u send files to strangers or only contacts? For NFC to work at least u just need a phone with NFC and bump it. Thats it.
ZONEofTECH Also, this concept isnt exactly new because people have been sharing data via shared saved Bluetooth connection for a while now. Even Samsungs flagship phones have their own auto share feature you can enable. The difference is just in the signal used here, Bluetooth and WiFi. So whys everyone getting all worked up over more of apples magic illusion as part of their longtime business practice? We know its not new technology. Just another feature on another smart phone
ZONEofTECH WHOAH!!!! SO REVOLUTIONARY!!!
ZONEofTECH When will ios7 for ipad4 will be release
ZONEofTECH ios 7 comes out in september
ZONEofTECH i actually like it time for something new, the new multitasking reminds me of the jailbreak tweak auxo
ZONEofTECH I think its funny that during Apples little pauses where people used to clap theres um not so much.
ZONEofTECH Nobody clapped when they said Bing was default. Take the hint, Apple.
ZONEofTECH I like the current voice (iOS 6)
ZONEofTECH Yes it will, (i4 Devices), and why would you like to move to samsung? Grab a new iPhone 5. Im with Apple, and I know EXACTLY why.
ZONEofTECH looks nice, Same old shit in the end
ZONEofTECH this new ipod 5th generation 16 gb has the same operating system as the ipod touch 5 (32  64 gb) but the camera and the loop are gone, this device can still run ios7 whereas the ipod 4th generation can not, apple made this for people that cant really afford the 32 gb or the 64 gb, so since its fairly cheap, no, i reckon this is better than the ipod touch 4th gen
ZONEofTECH I like to win becuz I dont have any apple products and I just have one old laptop even I got a on my grade my parents dont allow me
ZONEofTECH yes I want it my 3rd generation 64gb broke and is cant be fixed :( bc Im a student funds are low.
ZONEofTECH This application is amazing. I am using my iPhone 4 to do this!
ZONEofTECH Boompje means Little Tree in the netherlands
ZONEofTECH It just says: LOL cannot run from the DMG. Please select an location for LOL.Help?
ZONEofTECH i cant get to the LoL app at 3:00 :( when i go to my finder there is no logo or a button saying App, i have a different smaller type of finder :(
ZONEofTECH This video is not working.Riotgift codes, just here!Visit: FreeRpCodeGenerator. com.All gift codes are checked, they really work.
ZONEofTECH No it would not at all. There are new buttons on the xbox one controller that the 360 doesnt have.
ZONEofTECH I have triton warheads and fanatec wheel not happy they all conect lk the 360 pad thanks for hellp
ZONEofTECH it LOOKS awesome, but obviously you havent saw the features yet.
ZONEofTECH very ironic that it was played on a mac...
ZONEofTECH PS4 is Better, the Xbox one is so bold and the announcement made it seem so confusing
ZONEofTECH Trsuted and reliabele? Il take my 8 core oh and this was all coming from a pc gamer who doesnt own any consoles.
ZONEofTECH Por que no eligen varios los sacan por multiplicaciones
ZONEofTECH these are all jailbreak tweaks :
ZONEofTECH Definitely 1, it was simply mind blowing!
ZONEofTECH number one look better than the real one
ZONEofTECH its similar to number one. The real one.
ZONEofTECH 5 and 1 are the only thing simple enough you have to remember apple cant alienate the elderly and people that have grown accustomed to the simple operation. 1 also gives me a very windows phone feel. so now people will say that its beautiful and unique since apple did it.
ZONEofTECH the one by Almanimation
ZONEofTECH windows, please sue apple!
ZONEofTECH Yall think that xbox is gonna be better hell no and like i said if ps never came out xbox wouldve never exsisted plus they bite off every system there is out there fuck shit box
ZONEofTECH cheap iphone 5 omg :O ebay.co.ukitm111266659677?autorefreshtrue
ZONEofTECH I love the iphone lite
ZONEofTECH Apple rules! I got an iphone 4
ZONEofTECH is the iphone without contract 300 or with contract
ZONEofTECH Im currently using a Lumia 928, and while I see huge potential in the Windows Phone and the windows ecosystem as a whole, especially with Steve Ballmer stepping down as CEO I am not pleased with Microsofts lack of drive to compete against apple and google and if things dont improve by the time Im eligible for an upgrade, I may pick up one of those 5Cs up as price has always been my main reason to not go with Apple.
ZONEofTECH I work with apple, and I have a little detail that I have permission to say, the cheaper iPhone will be called iPhone Lite,
ZONEofTECH i am geting this phone
ZONEofTECH I like big phones but this is too far. The s III is the perfect size in my opinion. Maybe the s IV
ZONEofTECH what is the ppi of human eye?
ZONEofTECH iphone 4s is the best smartphone in the world
ZONEofTECH no the best is the iphone
ZONEofTECH S3 Mini Best 4 Ever..!!3
ZONEofTECH s3 mini for sure ! simply VALUE FOR MONEY ! in my country Iphone 4s is pretty expensive and s3 mini is like 200 Euro ! ..Good specs ! one of the best phones in the midrange category !
ZONEofTECH I did mention that in my Display comparison video. The S3 Mini does have better specs but gaming is much better on the iPhone since the games are way better optimised. Again, watch my gaming comparison video. You can see how in Real Racing 2 for example, you can even see the cars reflections in the side mirrors, while on the Galaxy S3 Mini, that isnt possible at all.
ZONEofTECH Im using a 4S a friend borrowed me while waiting for the Android replace for my broken Galaxy S(the first one). I thought about getting the Mini and the camera and video focus is the only thing keeping me back. Fact is when i got this iPhone i thought it performed better on the camera side but it actually sucks a bit : the flash pics are all white, theres a lot of noise if youre not in full daylight and overall doesnt feel like a high end phone camera imho.
ZONEofTECH Do they have USB OTG support or MHL tvout?
ZONEofTECH 2:20 Thats why I have dropbox on my stuff.
ZONEofTECH yay thanks cant wait! love your vids by the way
ZONEofTECH In Temple Run you couldve maxed out the settings and then compare it, and maybe check the settings in the Real Racing 3 (never played it, so dont know if there actually are any settings)...
ZONEofTECH I got iphone 4s and i just fck love it :)
ZONEofTECH How is your memory so small on the S3?! Mine is always 500 minimum even after clearing and stuff
ZONEofTECH Woow s3 mini better !
ZONEofTECH wich one is the best ??
ZONEofTECH S3 Mini can take better photos than which youve taken
ZONEofTECH I think the s3 mini has a better camera than ur recording camera lol
ZONEofTECH I have a s3 mini and it is really awsome for the price it is
ZONEofTECH dude for the love of Christ, less annotations please
ZONEofTECH so hows the video going :) i subscribed to you aswell
ZONEofTECH It lags sometimes. Sometimes, even really bad. Check out my S3 Mini Speed and Performance review to see for your own eyes. youtube.comwatch?vIBVCHRKWD70
ZONEofTECH the batter is 1500mhz not 15000mhz
ZONEofTECH No its really fast without any lags:)
ZONEofTECH Can it get tumblr as an app?
ZONEofTECH s4 I have new hover feature. Means u dont touch , then why the hell u keeping touching my screen , its hover dont u understand Human dont u know I am human I need to touch things , and always make mistake on touching bcoz thats what. I am doing Wtf
ZONEofTECH s4 I have new air gesture feature, that means u swipe ur hand away from screen to move to different screens on web , gallery human ooh god wtf my hands starting to pain , been using phone with one hand why use two Stupid
ZONEofTECH You just cant beat Samsung for their Graphics. They are unbelievable and the extra features, which I must admit took a little bit of getting used to, are awesome. iPhone 5not for me but then I personally feel there is a certain amount of snobbery here. The iPhone people think they are 8n a class above us mortals who happen to own anything less. THEY HAVENT GOT A CLUE. They are gonna have to come up with something pretty spectacular to match the S4. I wouldnt swop it for any iPhone,ever!!!
ZONEofTECH Really amazing smart phone with unbelievable apps .. personally i think it is much more better than i phone 5 and i.m planing to buy it once it is released here in UAE
ZONEofTECH HTC One supports WiFi ac
ZONEofTECH Watching thisbon my s4
ZONEofTECH Watching thisbon my s4
ZONEofTECH yeah, i b getting s4 in near future... its better than i phone bcause of special features like air touch , smart scroll,  adapt display...
ZONEofTECH I still prefer iPhone. Lighter  Thinner.
ZONEofTECH Yeah absolutely its better then iphone
ZONEofTECH Defuq??? They teasing the shit out of me :(
ZONEofTECH 1 word for this s4: BIG :D
ZONEofTECH internal: 32gb, external 64gb and it will not cost 400 dollars , it will cost around 800
ZONEofTECH I WANT IT SOOO BACK CANT WAIT!!
ZONEofTECH you havent seen nothing yet just wait for the Galaxy note 3. that will blow your away.
ZONEofTECH This is the best racing game I had played. Nice control than other racing games. Thank god it is free!
ZONEofTECH the latest android version is 4.2 not 4.1 and it has 441 ppi
ZONEofTECH Nice I now know a lot more about it and will get it more probably this is really made for the modern world and I will get it now
ZONEofTECH It doesnt. Actually, Apple phones freeze way more than Android phones. Where have you been? O.o
ZONEofTECH this trailer looks like shit TBH
ZONEofTECH I liked your video but half the information was wrong. The first race was an intro and the enemy drivers we just suppose to look like real players so people get into the multiplayer aspect of the game later on. Guess what I had also played with a lolololol on my first race. You made it sound like you had played the game a couple of times at least but in reality this is your first actual experience. This is a first impression video not a thorough review!!
ZONEofTECH You sound very Jewish (this is a compliment I think).
ZONEofTECH that is high end pc like highest graphics ultra for ps4 and pc. that amazing graphics
ZONEofTECH Thumps up if u think hes a noob
ZONEofTECH that is too good, Simply stunning
ZONEofTECH This would be so cool if they actually made this
ZONEofTECH I saw a pic where u can face time and call people as well as download games nigga
ZONEofTECH IF they make this so called iWatch it would have to have a special battery to power itself, because if there is a Charging port water would get inside it and therefore it wouldnt be water proof.
ZONEofTECH they should put small solar panels with rechargeable batteries and magnetic bands and the way to recharge it put it on a ring holder
ZONEofTECH First! :D Cant wait for the iWatch! I think its going to be exactly as you said in the video!. Pricewise, maybe a bit expensive like all Apple products, but TOTALY worth it :)
ZONEofTECH I thank u so much u really helped me
ZONEofTECH I think that the iwatch might look like an ipad except 10x smaller with a slap bracelet
ZONEofTECH this thing is a stupid piece of crap
ZONEofTECH I am announcing that you are announcing this guys announcement for Sonys announcement for when they will announce the PS4. I went deeper.
ZONEofTECH Hi Dude pls help ... ur link in the description does not work .. it says This websiteURL has been blocked until further notice either pursuant to Court orders or on the Directions issued by the Department of Telecommunications
ZONEofTECH all u have to do ist turn it on and then turn it back on
ZONEofTECH Thank you so much! Stupid IOS updates...  Never again!
ZONEofTECH surprised it actually worked, cheers!!!!
ZONEofTECH Not that the vid is bad, but what is the point? Why would I choose to do this instead of just buying a windows 8 computer?
ZONEofTECH If i do this... how can i get back to mavricks, or get rid of the windows? thanks!
ZONEofTECH hi, I just wanna say that my boot camp assistant keeps telling me it can not download the drivers from the server at this time or something like that.
ZONEofTECH HOW CAN you go back to mac! help!
ZONEofTECH Does this come with a free microsoft office program?
ZONEofTECH How to get the window support drivers
ZONEofTECH I have a question. When I try to make the things which you are doing it says me that I must need a USB. I didnt really understand why I need a USB. Please help me(sorry abaout my bad english)
ZONEofTECH i am upgrading my macbook to 16gb of ram and replacing the hard drive with 120gb SSD and running a 2nd 120GB SSD with a data doubler how would i go about having one SSD running mac os and the 2nd SSD running windows 8. PLEASE HELP!
ZONEofTECH My touch pad and mac pro keyboard doesnt work ... what I have to do ??
ZONEofTECH i need a windows 8 for highschool
ZONEofTECH My computer broke I really want it
ZONEofTECH i really need windows 8 on my mac because i need it for school and i would seriously appreciate it and i really like your videos and i need it so i can write things for school and i cant download anything for school on mac so it would help me a lot if u gave me it because homework would be so much easier for me then and id appreciate it the most so please let me have it
ZONEofTECH i just like windows 8 hahaha, i like the new surface
ZONEofTECH I want to win because, I am awesome and poor.
ZONEofTECH I liked and subscribed and i liked and shared on fb and google as Carolyn Barnett and i tweeted as CarolynRBarnett I want to win because my windows needs to be activated real soon.
ZONEofTECH I want this giveaway because I have never won a contest like this and i want to give one to my sister for her birthday
ZONEofTECH so i can upgrade my sisters windows vistia
ZONEofTECH shared and tweeted again
ZONEofTECH Im using windows 8 operating system
ZONEofTECH Mac OSX 10.6.8 Snow Leopard
ZONEofTECH Can you cross back over to OSCAR
ZONEofTECH why dont you just take this video down ?? save the embarrassment ...
ZONEofTECH In Australia there is no iPad 4 yet
ZONEofTECH iPad 5 is in September dude.Careful before making video.
ZONEofTECH It will probably have no buttons just touch screen
ZONEofTECH any rendering with zero bezel around the screen can be thrown right out! go get some better mock ups.
ZONEofTECH To all the people who disliked the video because of the inaccurate March release date 1) The video has been made in December of 2012 (yeah! more than half a year ago). Back in December, March was believed to be the release date for the iPad 5. 2) Everything I said in the video (except from the release date and possibly the A7 CPU) is going to be true. This means: iPad Mini design slight increase in speed same price same battery life same 163264128 gb capacities
ZONEofTECH Yes its totally out in march 2013
ZONEofTECH The new one is called PlayStation Super Slim. DO NOT buy that crap. Its the same price but it lacks a lot of features that the PS3 Slim has. The materials used in it are cheaper so Sony could reduce the production costs. PS4 is about to come out next year, same for the Xbox 720. I suggest waiting for that to release or just buy a PS3 and sell it next year when the PS4 is out. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH The same but with colors and the camra will be better but I think the I phone 6 will be with censers since the sg4 does pick me spot the outcast
ZONEofTECH NFC is a dead horse...
ZONEofTECH APPLES PART AT WWDC IS OVER... WHERES YOUR IPHONE 5 AT??
ZONEofTECH Thats what they always say until the 6 comes out
ZONEofTECH iPhone 3GS  3G  S for speed. iPhone 4S  4  S for Siri. iPhone 5S  5  S for Security (Because the iPhone 5S will have a fingerprint sensor)
ZONEofTECH S stands for speed, it means a bit faster model with the same design
ZONEofTECH I like apple more than windows but t
ZONEofTECH June of 2013? Its nearly September. You dont know what you are talking about. See ya.
ZONEofTECH Lots of useless commentary in this review. Like the extended analysis of the icon as well as the users likedislike for Justin Beiber. Who cares?
ZONEofTECH how do I know , how many songs in my iTunes ??
ZONEofTECH everytime i try to do something with my itunes i get a fucking head ake fucking complicated baffeling bull shit
ZONEofTECH cant add a playlist thts already in ur mac and the entire songs cant be transfered to ur i pod
ZONEofTECH Ok so I reset my Ipod and installed iOS6.1 and now my music that i have in my library will not sync over, any ideas on what i should do?
ZONEofTECH I hope Siri will be an app in the dock and it should looks like the iPad version. And no Siributton? Well it can have: the key on the top right on the wireless keyboard, which is now an ejectbutton, should be change into a microphonebutton. That button will be also used for dictation.
ZONEofTECH Nobody knows it will be called lynx, they may not use it as there was an edition of Ubuntu called lucid lynx!
ZONEofTECH well,its 13 inch, Core i7, 8GB ram, 256GB Flash Storage.
ZONEofTECH Hmm..I see... Anyway, I highly suggest using Mac OS X instead of windows on your MacBook. 80 of the Windows applications are available to Mac (as of jan 2012). However, if you really do want to use windows, I made a video that can help you. HOW to install windows 8 on a mac (and use it aside with Mac OS X), so you can check that out. Also, in case you need another genuine copy of Windows 8, I am giving one away, just click the thumbnail in the video and you will be taken to the giveaway Cheers
ZONEofTECH Good luck with that, but I suggest waiting for the new MacBook Pros to be released (somewhere in JulyAugust), before making a purchase. Anyway, I will keep you guys up to date with new releases so SUBSCRIBE to my channel if youre interested in seeing more videos. Anyway, good luck with the summer job :) Cheers Lucas!
ZONEofTECH Get out, go look at your AMD Radeon bullshit.
ZONEofTECH I am not surprised about the new Xbox :( I will probably stick with the PS4
ZONEofTECH Hey i am not buying that console if your cotller looks like that
ZONEofTECH Not as well they are all i5 and i7 cpus have 4 cores hyper threading let them have more but they really only have 4.
ZONEofTECH That is a great misunderstanding from a lot of people! But the fact is that you dont need a lot of money to buy a good PC that can run the latest games. With only 500, you can buy a PC that can run all of the latest games that have been coming out on consoles. When you compare that price to the 350 that you have to spend on a console, Id say the PC would be the best choice, considering that you can also use any type of screen and adapt a controller to it as well!
ZONEofTECH This guy didnt answer my question maybe someone here can... Ok does anyone know if the new Xbox will be backwards compatible with Xbox 360 games!?
ZONEofTECH not much stronger than the WIIU At all......gues i will buy the wii u instead of paying 500
ZONEofTECH fucking damit y cant halo 5 go on Xbox 360 and Xbox 720. 720 to buy it well be much money to buy it so much probably seem like it.
ZONEofTECH I was unimpressed with the 360 connect
ZONEofTECH If you play offline u can play random :p
ZONEofTECH Yeah, its working. Watch my entire video, I show you at the end that its not a hoax. Just try it for yourself

ZONEofTECH you delete a task by removing it to the righti know because i have that
ZONEofTECH Ya put nice iphone 4s
ZONEofTECH Nope, Siri response times are identical. It depends only on your internet connection since Siri connects to Apple servers to download the data.
ZONEofTECH Whops it seems that I have made a mistake. Apparently there is not Safari 6 for Windows YET. So Ill guess youll just have to wait a couple of more weeks for Apple to release Safari 6 for Windows. An alternative is to use Google Chrome app for iOS which syncs with Google Chrome on your computer. So yes, all of your opened pages,tabs,bookmarks and so on...WILL sync between your computer and your iOS device, wirelessly. :D Cheers! Please SUBSCRIBE for the fast reply  more videos! Cheers!

ZONEofTECH another idiot....youll eventually see what will happen to apple. I cant believe some of these lawsuits Apple is coming with...usually an innovative company means that they copy companies and make it better...to sue based on someone elses work moronic...just like you

ZONEofTECH my phone is 6288 (yeah)
ZONEofTECH This is quite possible, the most interesting video Ive seen.
ZONEofTECH im getting one today.
ZONEofTECH I cant wait, Im getting one next week .
ZONEofTECH I have this phone now I want a lumia 920
ZONEofTECH This video is so funny because hes recording this with an iphone 4
ZONEofTECH Its a great phone, I still have it. It supports iOS 6 which is the latest operating system for iOS devices. It does lag a bit if you dont close all the apps. To be honest, 135 is a bargain, but I still think you should get the iPhone 4 at least, if not a newer model (the retina display and the all new design is worth every penny).
ZONEofTECH Yeah were not here to see the review of the box . .
ZONEofTECH Im rocking the 3GS and here in a few days Ill be getting a 4s5
ZONEofTECH Why do fucking iPhones have to cost so much
ZONEofTECH here is one thing, the highest version of iOS: iPhone 3G: iOS 4.2.1 iPhone 3GS: iOS 6.1.3
ZONEofTECH Hi, i recently upgraded to a Samsung SSD 840 pro and enabled trim but the hard drive has started freezing, have you had this experience and is there a solution
ZONEofTECH Thx :D be sure to LIKE it, SHARE it and SUBSCRIBE to my channel in order to support me. Cheers :D
ZONEofTECH !THANX AGAIN MATE!cheerz!
ZONEofTECH hm, the system wont let me open trim enabler ?
ZONEofTECH Cool :D Im glad it works for you. Please SUBSCRIBE to my channel if you found my video useful :) Cheers Skyler!
ZONEofTECH I have one, and a a TON of pixels are broken. How do you fix it!
ZONEofTECH How much do u want for the Iphone
ZONEofTECH Iphone 5 but affordable abnd good iphone 4s
ZONEofTECH My first iPhone as well... Im still stuck with it. But to my luck, I can switch it out in about 1 week.
ZONEofTECH Lol, THIS was incredible just a couple years ago
ZONEofTECH can u pleases give this to me
ZONEofTECH 1. Because Romanians dont watch such videos, they are more popular in the USUK. 2. Because I will be going to the university in the UK, which will not only improve my English language skills, but will also give me a change of becoming a YouTube partner (which is not possible in Romania). Be sure to SUBSCRIBE to my channel for more videos!! Ive been putting a lot of effort in making them so a SUBSCRIPTION from you would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH This is soooooo old lol
ZONEofTECH Interesting video. The part about the SSD being immune to shocks is not true though. They are less prone to a mechanical drive, but they still can damage quite easily from shock.
ZONEofTECH Nice video, i will buy one now. I always liked the Samsung SSD. Thanks
ZONEofTECH Ok, just follow my video instructions. You have a MBP newer than 2011 which means that Internet Recovery will work for you. Just install your new SSD, restart it holding CMDR (which will bring up the internet recovery) and thats all. Internet recovery will download and install mountain lionlion (depending on which one you had installed on your old HDD). Thats all you have to do! Please be sure to like, favorite some of my videos if you find them useful. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH Thx :D please SHARE the video so more people can see it, because I honestly think it deserves way more views than it has. also SUBSCRIBE if you enjoyed my videos :) Cheers! erasborg
ZONEofTECH I fuckin hate Apple... I have to work on them for my job, but theyre a disgusting company.
ZONEofTECH If Im installing an SSD on a brand new MBP, is it necessary to clone the hard drive? In other words, will I miss anything if I do it via your internet recovery method? Or do I need to install additional appsprograms after I do the internet recovery? Thanks
ZONEofTECH im not an apple fan but i got this around 2007 for my birthday and it still works. only the battery is not as good anymore. i dont own any other apple devices because they are too expensive, but ive been happy with my 3rd gen nano.
ZONEofTECH Haha :D thats great :) By the way, I have a playlist in which I upload only Apple videos so be sure to check it out. I have a bunch of reviews, comparison and stuff like that. Also, be sure to SUBSCRIBE to my channel, if you enjoyed my content and would like to see more :) Cheers !
ZONEofTECH Hey couls make a tuttorial on how to fix it
ZONEofTECH Does this work well when gaming? Because when I play Skyrim or any games my laptop goes to hot like a fire! XD
ZONEofTECH Does anyone know where i can get it in the uk
ZONEofTECH I play alot of games even 24 hrs, and sometimes my laptop crashes...tell me please if this is wroth it for an gaming person! XD
ZONEofTECH good presentation man...i was really looking for an opinion on what i should buy.
TopGear New connected car standards put Europe into top gearImagine that you are driving along, and a message is projected on your windscreen, warning you of an accident that has just happened around the next corner. This could soon be a reality thanks to new European standards. Connected cars, able to communicate with each other and with road infrastructures, are expected to appear on European roads in 2015.Two European standards organisations, ETSI and CEN, confirmed today that the basic set of standards requested by the European Commission to make connected cars a reality has been fully completed. The norms which they have adopted ensure that vehicles made by different manufacturers can communicate with each other.The EU invested more than 180 million in research projects on cooperative transport systems, whose results helped develop the standards. This will put the European car industry, which provides 13 million jobs, out in front in the race to develop the next generation of cars.http:europa.eurapidpressreleaseIP14141en.pdf

screenjunkies Was kinda wondering...wow, you really went after this guy! Then your voice appears on his videos in full Transformers mode and you start thinking wait a minute...this is just a birthday roast! And Jon, I know that Sean is your friend and all, but he might look to get out and date one in a while instead of surrounding himself with toys. I mean, you have a wife and kids and still do toy reviews. Just saying. And meeting booby Cosplayers at ComicCons DOES NOT COUNT!
screenjunkies Honest trailers: captain America
screenjunkies Honestly made my day! :D
screenjunkies That was perfect hahaha nice job, Jon Happy Birthday, Sean!

screenjunkies Vince Vaughn doesnt even know what his own characters do in the movies...
screenjunkies Sooo..... any chance of an Honest Trailer for The Internship?
screenjunkies when you went on google
screenjunkies why did he leave Jennifer aniston
screenjunkies Dude starts to turn into Christopher Walken
screenjunkies This video shows how intelligent, cool and witty Vince Vaughn is in reallife without a script in front of him. Also, I dont think he was upset at any point of the interview. He just rolled with it and that is why Vince Vaughn KICKS ASS!!!!
screenjunkies He was most mad when he asks him about was he in jurassic park
screenjunkies How did your chin get so butt shaped Ken?
screenjunkies that blond guy was Walker you dumbass.. been in the franchise since the beginning..
screenjunkies if u watch fast and furious making u will realize its a piece of shit. i watch ff for fun and paul walker. and the rock is better than vin diesel.Ps:paul walker was a real awesome driver out of fast and furious
screenjunkies Vin  a better actor. The Rock  cooler.
screenjunkies You want us to pick whos better between The Pacifier or The Tooth Fairy? Can suicide be a choice?
screenjunkies The Rock, because Vin Deisel is a tool.
screenjunkies The rock because he can shoot berries (journey 2)
screenjunkies I drove one of those Scions, Current speed record (stock no mods except stitches in the broken seat) 110mph. Good luck beating it, that little 140HP I4 cant do much more.
screenjunkies Michael Fassbender as Data?
screenjunkies I would have Patrick Stewart as Picard !
screenjunkies Jim Parsons as DATA...
screenjunkies If there has to be yet another scifi reboot, Id like it to be Space: 1999. That one kind of cries out for reboot treatment. I remember hearing some studio was going to do it a couple years ago, but now it seems to be languishing in development hell with no end in sight.
screenjunkies Needs a brand new crew for a reboot of ST:TNG. Hate the idea of trying to recast a winning cast. However with the remakes of STOS, JJ Abrams was smart to go younger and then have them grow up as the original cast. But for ST:TNG, a whole new crew is needed. B4 would be Datas counterpart on the show. As for the rest, I say keep the nuclear family dynamic and look into the problems associated with today. Such as a Gay captain, a transgendered doctor, an alien married couple, unmarried parents, adoption, and others.
screenjunkies keep it whoopie, fuckin great.
screenjunkies I always thought Colin Salmon would make a good Picard if they ever rebooted it for TV
screenjunkies TOM HIDDLESTON AS COMMANDER DATA!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Tom Hiddleston For Data , and has Patrick Stewart aged that much not to still play his old role, that man doesnt age !
screenjunkies Good JJ the Star Wars asshole who ruined Star Trek to run it to an end...
screenjunkies Dont back Zach! Celebrities dont belong on kickstarter !
screenjunkies Shhhhhh!! Agent smith might be listening!
screenjunkies Headed to the Ron and Fez show? Awesome, cant wait to here you on there.
screenjunkies What authority do you have to tell him what to do with his money?
screenjunkies What authority do you have to tell him what to do with his money?
screenjunkies fight money with money. hahaha. :3
screenjunkies Easy there I wasnt lashing out, just some foul language humor. I will agree with you that Zach isnt that rich, but the fact that he is rich whatsoever should be enough. That site loses its value when people like Zach Braff ask for millions of dollar for an indie project when the man has millions of net worth. Yes those of us that understand know that his net worth is not money that he can actually spend but still man, 22mil net worth asking for millions of dollars is absurd.
screenjunkies i understand your dislike but it brings alot of people who otherwise wouldnt go onto kickstarter a reason to go on. they may back other people after looking around and also what if the movie doesnt go well ? spreading the cost of several thousand people is alot less of a risk then 1 person no matter how rich he is
screenjunkies Amen! I barely have enough money to eat a burrito, let alone pay for a friggin millionaire to make a movie. PS, this campaign is CLEARLY a satire. But satire is kind of a big word, so I get why lots of people wouldnt get it ...
screenjunkies I knew I shouldnt have watched this video... I almost threw up and now my stomach aches..
screenjunkies why was everything so blurry? that seemed kinda weird, it really took me out of the moment
screenjunkies Well they are making a show of it. It would be a lot less entertaining if they just sat there in silence for the duration.
screenjunkies This director is sick . And messed up
screenjunkies Game of Thrones with my dad.
screenjunkies Can you make your mommwatch a hostile movie or something
screenjunkies My mom and dad always change the channel when it gets to sexual ahha
screenjunkies Damn that chick has big ass knees
screenjunkies iron man 3 was good at box office,but i hated the mandarin
screenjunkies Pacific rim was cool but my favorite part was when they got a full sized suburine and used it like a bat and slammed it right in the monsters face he he:D :D :D
screenjunkies Iron man 3Monsters uDespicable me 2WolverinePacific rimStar Trek into darknessSmurfs 2Man of steelLone Ranger
screenjunkies i love superman, also the trailers looked fucking awesome but the man of steel sucked ...BALLS
screenjunkies Ironman 3 almost as bad as daredevil
screenjunkies These guys was rite about TLR.
screenjunkies Dude, Star Trek Into Darkness was extremely awesome.
screenjunkies MOS Should be 2 for me, first IM3
screenjunkies 3:19 gets paid to give this fake Hollywood smile
screenjunkies I just realized right now that the ROCK reminds me of a President Obama ripped and on roids! If Obama started pumping iron and got super big and shaved his head.. hmm...
screenjunkies This video was awesome
screenjunkies I would love to meet Nick Cage!!!! I have watched all of his movies.... LOVE HIM
screenjunkies I would go nuts if I interview Leo dicaprio n mark wahlberg
screenjunkies Id flip out if I met Hal Rudnick on the Screen Junkies set. Id give anything to talk comic books and movies and Game of Thrones or whatever.
screenjunkies dont ever send him again :)
screenjunkies Meet Arnold schwarzenegger ill just stop talking and stare at him awkwardly until he feels weird and then shout GET TO THE CHOPPA!!! xD

screenjunkies This was a pretty trivial guide, it didnt really tell much about the story so far. Just the characters.
screenjunkies Favorite character: Hot pie
screenjunkies i thought syrio was pretty cool and also jaquen hgar
screenjunkies Favorite: Arya StarkAnnoying: Sansa StarkHate: Melisandre and Joffrey
screenjunkies You should ask the characters people hate EXCEPT Joffrey. Lets agree that everyone cheered when saw the Bitch King dying (even reading the books I couldnt stop smiling).
screenjunkies favorite characters: Thyrion,Daenerys,Arya and Robbcharacters I hate: Joeffrey,Theon,Viserys,Stannis and his redheaded devil wifecharacters I like as well but arent that relevant: Hodor, Shae, fat kid, Bronn,Sansa,Bran,Sam,the one with dirty hairannoying characters: Johah Mormont,Jon Snow,lord Baelish..characters I dont care about at all: Catelyn,Brianne of Tarth, Tywin, Lorashottest characters: Khal Drogo,Robb Stark,Daenerys,Cersei.CHARACTERS I USED TO HATE BUT I DONT ANYMORE: Jaime,Khal Drogo
screenjunkies 1.Tyrion2.Hodor3.Geoffry
screenjunkies you pronounced 99 of the names wrong... dissapointing
screenjunkies Rob was king IN the north, not king OF the north! And yes, thats a difference. Its like King IN Prussia but not OF Prussia, he still accept the authority of the iron throne, but rules his own kingdom, build by his former bannermen, which liegelord he already was before.
screenjunkies Monty Python and the Holy Grail
screenjunkies Hahahaha this is great. White people suck.
screenjunkies Caddyshack  Caddyfest!!!

screenjunkies That was incredibly racist to Irish people and no were not too drunk to notice
screenjunkies 1:46 Hal smile looked like the joker if he was severely bleeding from the mouth
screenjunkies 24 had the best drinking game DAMMIT
screenjunkies I always thought that during Smallville if you drank every time someone walked into a room or someones house without knocking or when they just stopped talking on a cell phone and hungup without saying goodbye...well youd be drunk within 15 minutes. This mat sound like manners pet peeves, but it happened like every 5 minutes.
screenjunkies Family Guy. Every time Peter does a flashback, drink a whole bottle of Jack Daniels so you cant remember anything.
screenjunkies Honest trailers drinking game :  Drink every time the narrator says BEWBS.
screenjunkies When reading Star Wars books: whenever the Jedi do something stupid and screw up the galaxy drink a lomin ale. (Beer with green food coloring) When watching STNG: whenever the Counselor uses the Force for absolutely no reason have a shot...
screenjunkies Claims to know pop culture and speaks for peopleAsserts British Office is better than THE Office:
screenjunkies go and get a job man. i know you smoke met.
screenjunkies National TrekkieTrekker day. A day to be nerdy about all trek! This does need to be done though. Star Trek has been around for almost 50 years, has 7 TV series and 13 movies.Dont make me go all Vulcan mind trick on you
screenjunkies He only said three words on national television, its not like zombies are going to attack everybody because of some obscure email with the word zombie in itdont quote me on this i think Im tired or high
screenjunkies Im not sure why people were surprised, hes exactly as good at SciFi as he is at his job.
screenjunkies HAL RUDNICK FOR PRESIDENT!
screenjunkies Obama Horrible President
screenjunkies Nerdsmas we celebrate by letting the nerds rule for a day. We take control of the schools and hack our way into the army. Next, world domination!!!!!!!!!!! WHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies This entire thing is hilarious, but for some reason I find the toothpaste part the most hilarious.
screenjunkies Man. Even watching this trailer is boring. I think Id kill myself if I tried to watch it.
screenjunkies Still cant believe they did FOUR trailers for fucking Twilight and just one for the whole Harry Potter saga. Theres still so much weirdness in the HP films left unridiculed! Lots on mouth breathing and mumbling and weird eyebrows  and thats just the acting!
screenjunkies Am I the only one who finds it hilarious when Bella yells at Jacob about nicknaming her daughter Nessie? Why on earth would she be pissed about that?? Vampires are ok but a Loch Ness Monster? OH HELL NAW! :P sheesh
screenjunkies What should have happened: Bella: Why cant you see how perfectly happy i am? Edward: SILLY ME!
screenjunkies Search  Great ambition
screenjunkies Do Divergent, please! :D
screenjunkies Creepy CGI baby Oh my LOOOOOOL!!!
screenjunkies What load garbich this is.
screenjunkies How many happen with dialogue? How long?
screenjunkies so... many... STARES!!!!
screenjunkies This is the most exciting and actionfilled video on youtube!
screenjunkies They put rober downey jr in this movie???? 24:55 da heck?? OO
screenjunkies OK I get a brownie badge for watching the whole thing.
screenjunkies oh my god I made it just to the first movie lol its hilarious and mostly sad :(
screenjunkies 0:47 Cant stop laughing LOL!
screenjunkies OH GOD DOES IT EVER END?!
screenjunkies After watching this, try counting when your gf is staring at you. PRETTY weird!
screenjunkies Dream host, gotta go Bruce Cambell.
screenjunkies i cried when you did the australiancockney accent of adelehow can someone be that unfunny?
screenjunkies I certainly did not watch the Oscars last night...however, I can totally get behind the ScreenJunkies making fun of it all. Good stuff. :)
screenjunkies Why cant Neil Patrick Harris host???
screenjunkies This guy is a total fucking faggit
screenjunkies Wait, wait. Did you guys find Teds joke antisemitic but you can make fun of Adeles weight? B.S.
screenjunkies Nah, he pronounced it like a german dude, that accent, the r o0. I mean after I heard that I had to check wikipedia whether he was from Germany :D.
screenjunkies ChaosMarine52 human bones dont bend, we have joints, so does Wolverine
screenjunkies simple for me i want to see Spiderman and Daredevil
screenjunkies Not to be mean but i dont think the red head knowns what she is talking about gambit was the coolest looking xmen but thats about it.
screenjunkies This will suck, BIG TIME.They changed the story completely. Of course they did, because the real story isnt just a wolverine story, and this is obviously just another wolverine movie.People like a mindless neanderthal who uses violence to solve every problem. Makes them feel better about being like that themselves I guess
screenjunkies Its so gratifying to see all my thoughts on these movies confirmed by fellow fans. Gambit needs a reboot, Rogue needs to gain flight and super strength and stop being such a twat, and we need the next trilogy of Spiderman movies devoted to the Symbiote storyline. Spiderman 4  the symbiote is brought back by JJ Jamesons son on a space mission and finds peter, etc, ends with peter at the church getting rid of the symbiote, which finds Brock. Second Movie is Venom stalking peter, fighting him, being jailed...where Brock meets Cletus Kasady and Venom gives birth to Carnage. Carnage breaks free, Peter and Venom form an uneasy alliance. Third movie is a retelling of Maximum Carnage. Box Office Gold.
screenjunkies its been down hill since xmen 2, but i liked superman returns it wasnt the best acting from clark kent in history but i dont believe that was any fault of bryans. but dont bring back the blue nuclear reactor. seriously
screenjunkies All marvel super heroes should join forces as the Avangers
screenjunkies do a will fantastic four suck? because of the shit cast that has been announced
screenjunkies avengers, fantastic 4, and maybe some xmen too. I really want this movie to be good I LOVE xmen and they need redeeming. my nightmare scenario is this: we all know that time travel movies are hard, but xmen comics have a lot of material to work with from time traveling xmen. so it might be easier to figure out the plot, which I really hope they do because time travel plot holes are the WORST.my ultimate fear is that they will put so much time and effort into making the plot and storyline correct and workable that they will forget all the great action and character that goes into a xmen production
screenjunkies Natalie Portman right?
screenjunkies I dont want to live on this planet anymore.
screenjunkies Very misleading title, but thanks for wearing long sleeves for a change.
screenjunkies She looks like a female James Franco
screenjunkies take these ladies outside...and shoot them.
screenjunkies When she said the Natalie Portman thing I seriously shrieked. :
screenjunkies how come that so, did she blow you? comment is not in the top
screenjunkies twizzler girl is so not fuckable
screenjunkies Bane blows up the field
screenjunkies he obviously never saw Pitch Black.  wasnt the Rock in the Tooth Fairy ???? the Rock is a pussy compared to Riddick !!!!
screenjunkies Best Super Bowl halftime would be watching Adam Sandler dress up like ghost rider while the rock and Liam Neeson try and stop him.
screenjunkies Best Halftime Show would be if Morgan Freeman narrated the halftime show while, Johnny Depp barges in with a ship and Tony Stark came in with the Avengers and they would have Battle of DISNEY!
screenjunkies One where you got shot
screenjunkies Pink Floyd laser light show!
screenjunkies Jason Bateman seemed a weeeee bit annoyed
screenjunkies liam neeson and morgan freeman rap battle.
screenjunkies I suppose the whole stereotype comes from the church ruling middle age Europe. im a druid and the amount of times people have asked me if I have ever sacrificed a goat or some other animal is unreal. very few people understand that druids, witches etc. are actually real and think they are just fairytale people who make fireballs
screenjunkies is it just me or were the other witches embarrassed of the one in the middle?
screenjunkies so they where pissed about the bad witches, understandable.. but none of them acknowledge the few good witches in the movie? i agree tho the movie was pretty bad but still. the red hair girl was cool, practical magic is a good movie :)
screenjunkies These witches(if witches exist) fucked it up for any other witches who possibly exist, btw shouldnt this shit be a secret because its kind of weird to see people openly putting their magical status on YouTube. Btw how dare they compare it to bring black, and then show no evidence of similarity.....sad. :(
screenjunkies FYI: If you want a Schindlers List of paganism try The Burning Times Trilogy. It shows actual history about how people who believed in pantheism were systematically murdered. And even folks who didnt were killed. Over a 400 year time span 100s of thousands of people were burned at the stake. Women, Children, Men. The fact that youre willing to list Jesus as a fairytale monster saves this program totally. Thats awesome. I want to be clear that I like Screen Junkies, I just want the public to respect that other faiths are valid too.
screenjunkies the spell for a parking space was just her saying please give me a parking spot. keep it unoccupied for me in Greek.
screenjunkies these are not witches they just said in modern greek : Please keep a parking spot open for me . WTF if they wanted to be believable they should at least say it in ancient Greek :P Or it becomes magic when you just change the language ?
screenjunkies It worries me that when she was asked how many children she has eaten she hesitated. I smell a witch hunt coming on.That parking space spell was daft as when you are casting that spell...somebody is stealing the last parking space!! :p
screenjunkies Im actually not sure if this is real or a joke.Im kind of scared now.
screenjunkies I dont like rob Corday
screenjunkies Looks like this actually happened. Didnt anybody see Nick jump back when Rob tried to grab his crotch?

screenjunkies I am strangely very, very attracted to Rob Corddry... even in zombie makeup. Not to actual zombies, mind. Just Rob Corddry. Is that weird? I feel like that might be a little weird.
screenjunkies With enough lube one can drown almost anything, even a zombie.

screenjunkies Movies rarely  if ever  live up to their trailershype. Which is basically the point: Con the public into seeing your film. Screen Junkies HONEST TRAILERS vids are based upon this premise.
screenjunkies I have seen the Honest Trailer,  while it was hilarious, it didnt prove the film was senseless. I understood the film clearly.
screenjunkies 13 years to be exact...
screenjunkies Say Say hello to my little friend
screenjunkies Mas ele falou umas verdades a kkk, tipo a parte dos cinco finais diferentes, cara aquilo encheu o saco velho.
screenjunkies No, no era pela a enorme distancia do condado at o vulco e que as aguias no podiam aparecer na frente do olho de vagina
screenjunkies MAGNETO SEM TETO KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
screenjunkies Sacrificing just to come back to life, making it no sacrifice at all. Thats what I aways told my friends. Yes, Im talking about Jesus.
screenjunkies Legenda o novo vdeo deles, A Origem. )
screenjunkies eles deveriam fazer sobre o filme de Percy Jackson, no tem nenhum filme mais facil de zuar.
screenjunkies Hahaushausa Muito bom! Pensei em quase tuso isso quando assisti o filme!  tanto furo que no consegui curtir xP Mas faltou a INCRIVEL morte da Thalia haushausha
screenjunkies Mesmo assim foi fodao!
screenjunkies Best movie interview ever?
screenjunkies I was also thinking Samuel Jackson as Worf being that if any black man is going to cut people with a giant blade, it would be Samuel Jackson. Also I picked Vin Disel as Picard because I want there to be little doubt about Picard being able to kick Kirks ass.
screenjunkies Please do inception!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies i want a tee shirt maaaan
screenjunkies My favorite part, was the Star Trek trailer. Amen to that!!!
screenjunkies Thanks...almost! It is our goal to please you. Jewman is my superhero alter ego btw.
screenjunkies Thanks! Youre awesome!
screenjunkies Aaaaand theyre drinking anyway. PS I think Judd is drunk
screenjunkies Haha fucking creepy cunt
screenjunkies That trailer was stupid
screenjunkies also directed Dawn of the Dead quite flawlessly. Just sayin.
screenjunkies Johnny Depp couldnt do Edward from Twilight because Edward has to be a Pssy.
screenjunkies I just watched this film yesterday, and I have returned with a totally new perspective about superman.
screenjunkies I am too. :( Gotta watch a clean comedic video now to feel better.
screenjunkies Anyone stuck on the fact he said he had over a couple million dollars of superman memorabilia?
screenjunkies Anybody who played The Joker before him. :I
screenjunkies This needs a lot more views!
screenjunkies Stop giving Adam Sandler ideas!
screenjunkies I hate it when gold coins get stuck in my teeth.
screenjunkies i would be jewish if i can eat bacon
screenjunkies Didnt even watch It Im sorry.
screenjunkies He got arrested because he had raped 500 people all of which claimed to have only seen a flash of light and a sharp pain in their ass
screenjunkies Im an elf, and I need a sandwich after watching this.
screenjunkies I love how bored and unenthusiastic the trailer narrator sounds.
screenjunkies Sem essas partes importantes do livro: haha concordei na hora, eu queria ver essas cenas no filme mas no tem pena
screenjunkies lmao! the host reminded me of Ruxin from the league...and this concept would be a fantastic video game! someone needs to do it, like now!
screenjunkies Of course there would be a hint of anime.
screenjunkies That fat Flash must have felt so amazing during his power play. I wanted to see more of all the characters though. I got a glimpse of some good ones they didnt show.
screenjunkies You shall not pass... :D
screenjunkies This is actually funny though. Loved all the references XD
screenjunkies Moral of the story is... Dumbledoor is a bitch! HAHA
screenjunkies thats not football, thats handegg
screenjunkies OMG CROSSPLAYING CIEL PHANTOMHIVE FROM BLACK BUTLER IS IN THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOMNOMNOMNOM

screenjunkies OMG SO FUNNY! Do more hatful comments (by the way, i luve ya hal!)
screenjunkies Anne Frankly its not that funny
screenjunkies Youll never get me on a game show about anything Twilight. The books are emergency toilet paper and all copies of every movie should be shredded and any fan ought to be ashamed of herself.
screenjunkies host: Here we have 3 die hard twilight fanshost: what year was the first twilight film released?girl: thats a really hard one
screenjunkies So the point was? Fuck it Tacos.DeadPool
screenjunkies i hear the disapointment in the dads voices and i feel sorry for them
screenjunkies Why do people always complain about other people actually liking the twilight movies who fucken cares it dosnt affect u in anyway period (also the movies are whatever for me)
screenjunkies If I had a choice to hang out with Bieber or Robert Pattinson, Id choose to stab myself in the eye with pins.
screenjunkies Twilight is stupid... Im a girl
screenjunkies I am a horrible human being...I wanted someone to cry. I really did
screenjunkies That sounds more like the public schooling system...
screenjunkies I cried with laughter when I saw this.
screenjunkies Disneys Star Wars Auditions!
screenjunkies Luke Dont Kiss the Girl! Its Your Sister!
screenjunkies Was that the original voice of iago
screenjunkies true blood drink everytime you think it is stupid
screenjunkies I like the way youre thinking. I wonder if we can find the actors imdb or something.
screenjunkies Is that the REAL Jack Sparrow???
screenjunkies it will be the opposite, if Disney wants, a great new trilogy can start like pirates of caribbean. Deeply i enjoyed the avengers more than dark knight rises !
screenjunkies wasted 5 min of my life
screenjunkies fail. they would have me pissed as well. At least it should be funny
screenjunkies You can feel the cringe.
screenjunkies fucking youtube wont let me hit dislike twice
screenjunkies Hal Rudnick has the uncanny resembles to PeeWee Herman at 4:27... Right?!? Back off Cuz!
screenjunkies That was fucking hilarious!
screenjunkies This is... the exact opposite of funny, Just two assholes in robes?
screenjunkies you know, mentioning honey boo boo as not being in the video, you have put her in the video... just sayin
screenjunkies Agreed, reminds me of mega64, only instead of being funny without being annoying (in most cases anyway) these guys seem to think the best way to create street humor, is to be utter jerks! Yes, id totally laugh if someone came along and stole my phone saying i am a jedi, you will give me your phone.
screenjunkies I think the voice might have been Billy Mays I think I herd him say but wait theres more
screenjunkies I couldnt stop laughing at the MJ look a like xD
screenjunkies He didnt mean anything mean,hes just an idiot. xD That made my day!
screenjunkies Funny shit man youre hilarious keep em coming :)
screenjunkies Those werent orbs. It was a plane. And the voice you hear, its a dog barking. Nice try. This is a hoax guys, move on.
screenjunkies Please, say: Hello, Jovem Nerd?
screenjunkies hahahah this was so funny!
screenjunkies I think i have cancer now.... in my eyes... and ears..... and in my soul
screenjunkies i dont know why i wached this
screenjunkies Turnabout is fair play! LOL!   HBB does classic Christopher Walken.
screenjunkies alana looks like glitsy
screenjunkies As a Walken fan, I found this to be a disgrace to Christopher Walken.
screenjunkies Why am I not surprised they cant even read them big fenagly words?
screenjunkies Fucking pigs. Disgraces to humanity.
screenjunkies I lost IQ just from clicking on this.....
screenjunkies oh my god!, I felt myslef trowing up just watching him eat it.
screenjunkies that was an EPIC WASTE OF TALENT.
screenjunkies Walken Reads Boo BooWalken, Farrell, Rockwell perform Honey Boo Boo....?
screenjunkies Yeah, this is why I have the reputation of being awesome. I share all the good things I find with you, my dearies :)
screenjunkies Alana Thompson is her real name...
screenjunkies Al Pacino and Robert De Niro
screenjunkies Because it glorifies and exploits the moronic and disgusting and paints a terrible picture of some of the worst stereotypes of Southern culture. I dont hate the family for taking the paycheck. I hate the marketing, the producers, and general populus for supporting this crap.
screenjunkies sometimes, there are people who make me want to fashion a whip from barbed wire so i can hit them mercilessly and repeadetly with it, like jamie fox did in django unchained. the honey boo boo child creature and the meaty trashcan that spawned it into this world, are definitely high up on that list
screenjunkies benjamim button kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies Aquele momento tenso que eu encontro alguem do Eredan nos videos que eu tava vendo...
screenjunkies Benjamin Button HUEHUHEAOIAE
screenjunkies pleeeeeeease fo the Inglorious Bastards!!!!

screenjunkies 401 Angrey albanians disliked this video.
screenjunkies Best screenjunkies episode evr
screenjunkies Battlefield earth honest trailer.
screenjunkies I like where you punched sifu in the dick.
screenjunkies Id tap hals niece...just putting it out there
screenjunkies Hmmm...I havent heard of this film.
screenjunkies This is exactly what Looper was like.
screenjunkies LOL. My best friend is myself, NOW. )
screenjunkies there are 2 movies: Angels in the Outfield (Joseph GordonLevitt) The Kid (Bruce Willis)
screenjunkies This is from two movies, The Kid (2000) and Angels in the Outfield (1994) My job here is done
screenjunkies Bruce really loves himself.
screenjunkies Someone should really fire the ads  marketing department in youtube. They are playing the same ad for almost everything single of these clips by screenjunkies. The very same ad, in the very same day, the same hour. It becomes annoying and I just ignore it. Redbull is really dumb to advertise in this way, cos the only thing they get is frustration towards their brand.
screenjunkies wow this is kinda funny they used the same actors for looper lol
screenjunkies Ok, Im pretty sure this was all staged. The kid I could believe, but half these people are grown adults who have probably seen enough movies to at least know the basics of storytelling to know Avengers did succeed in those regards. It all just depends on whether the story resonates with you or not.
screenjunkies I wont say there werent problems with the movie, but I loved it nonetheless. Sometimes you want to watch a comedy, sometimes you want to watch an intricate mystery, sometimes you just want to watch fight scenes and explosions. I got my eye candy out of this film.
screenjunkies Chilis instead of Applebees
screenjunkies i only watch it cause of LOKI
screenjunkies Did you guys cherry pick people who sound stupid to represent Avengers haters? Its not a hard movie to critique. The overlong battle sequences and overdone CGI. The contrived plot points. The boring villain. The flawed character development. Etc. etc.
screenjunkies The little girl sucked
screenjunkies I clicked on this thinking I was about to get angry at some Avenger Haters, I was glad to be proven wrong:)
screenjunkies I like how at the end Hal was like What the hell is wrong with you people? lol
screenjunkies I did not like that Beverly Hills girl
screenjunkies how they think he is legit :D
screenjunkies Am the only one who thinks he looks like an older McLovin?
screenjunkies By the way heres Flulas McDonalds Prank call w Ownage pranks  a vlog. Prank Call: watch?vVrb5Bj8YPwc Vlog: watch?vsJH62IRKy0 P.S Youll love the prank call!
screenjunkies So....very.....epic.....
screenjunkies Haha, Genius, but not in a creepsy way.
screenjunkies Hahahahahahaha That was awesome. 3 Flula
screenjunkies Yes, Flula is so very very dope. He should do all the interviews for all the movies from everywhere.
screenjunkies WHY IS JASON SEGEL CUTE AS HELL
screenjunkies Im NOT 6...IM ATE,U butthead!!!!
screenjunkies Yea for some reason all of their movies are terrible
screenjunkies I dont know what it is but something about referring to Shrooms as Magic Mushrooms irritates me.If I had to venture a guess it would probably be the fact that it suggests whimsy when tripping whether a good or bad trip is anything but.Anyways I get the feeling that the real joke was on the interviewers and not on Eric. Long live Tim and Eric!
screenjunkies Your uncle is a mentally disturbed man.
screenjunkies lol so many stupids !
screenjunkies He sounds like the clown in Happy Gilmore
screenjunkies caspilmary calm down, I was kidding!!
screenjunkies Last time i laughed was on a shroom trip two years ago...

GameSack Why the hell would someone buy the GBA version instead of the SNES one on the VC?
GameSack This is a sack of shit, didnt mention the microphone and camera making it blatently obvious whats happening, fucking cocks
GameSack Dan and Phil should actually do this. Dan should be the one behind the phone, and Phil should be the one carrying the speaker. It could be hella funny. Or just make fun of Dan by making Dan carry the speaker! But, Im sure Phil wouldnt be as cruel as Dan in putting those sentences. Haha.
GameSack The best bit about the last one was he looked like he didnt want to be in the lift with the people,not the speaker
GameSack Love it, please do some more. Maybe in public like a bus stop.
GameSack Its about time chris gets to embarass scott
GameSack Im working on the garde manger video. Its in processing,  hasnt even gone to upload yet. Its about an hour, but I couldnt find a place to cut it, I revisit some unfinished thoughts  stories later in the video,  continue some. Theres a lot of stories,  after the Apple cut, its just stories for 12 min or so. Its all fruit  veg garnish,  pretty basic. I need to play with that chaud froid sauce before I do it,  todays probably not the day. Thanks for the idea  encouragement.
screenjunkies LOL! Nice vid.. Love seein the butthurt comments because the video wasnt fuck this and fuck that.. If these fuckin fucks wanna hear some fuckin this and fuckin that go watch any of these fuckin movies made by fuckin Martin Scorsese.. fuck.. HAHAHAH.. The use of the word fuck was used in humor folks!
screenjunkies I thought the video would have been longer.

screenjunkies They forgot Leon: The Professional
screenjunkies starship troopers because its so underrated
screenjunkies When they showed point blank i just thought of hot fuzz
screenjunkies Watch wolf of wall st with her
screenjunkies The Big Lebowski is one of the best 90s movies.
screenjunkies Say: Bananananananana
screenjunkies Say: Is Griphook gonna have to choke a witch?
screenjunkies Please say Sharp as a thistle, clean as a whistle, govner
screenjunkies How is peter capaldi not on the list of people who have won an oscar in this trailer
screenjunkies Your videos are consistantly absolutely hilarious whilst also being incredibly astute, biting critiques! You never cease to amuse and impress  Im completely in awe of your work. Your GODS and YOU FUCKING ROCK DAMN IT!!!!
screenjunkies Say : Greed is good with your awesome voice !
screenjunkies Say: I swear by my pretty floral bonnet I will end you
screenjunkies Please say: It is gonna be legen wait for it dary
screenjunkies Look at a transformers sign upside down, its a darth vader sign.
screenjunkies Lets not forget one of the most important things in making transformers cool.PUT THE FKING THEME SONG IN IT!That alone will up it by about 2 stars!
screenjunkies Always something to bitch about with these people.
screenjunkies The drugged brownie turned me off from Transformers ever since. It looked like a crappy highschool campus comedy.
screenjunkies I wanna see what nick mundy thinks of captain america winter soldier
screenjunkies My god this Nick guy is hilarious.
screenjunkies YESSSS!!!! LOL YESSSS!!!! Robots kicking robots in the balls!! lol
screenjunkies nicklback? isnt it linkin park

screenjunkies 0:40 Everyones reaction when they found out the rumor about Bieber retiring from music was fake...
screenjunkies Do Captain America 2 do it do it now. Obey my Orders.
screenjunkies can anyone give me a list of all these movies in order
screenjunkies There is nothing like that feeling of watching The Usual Suspects for the first time.
screenjunkies You better do green lantern
screenjunkies whats the twist in saw? I dont remember one?
screenjunkies The red wedding wasnt that bad. I didnt care about any of the characters that died (except for the wolves).
screenjunkies the best part of the whole season three was this line: then my watch begins
screenjunkies Laughed so hard at the part where he says She must avenge her brothers wang!!
screenjunkies Is Catelyn Stark realllly dead? I wonder.....
screenjunkies Correction Joffrey is a basdard since his father was not Robert....
screenjunkies Best third season moment: Tormund Giantsbane saying Most men fuck like dogz. AUF! AUF! AUF!
screenjunkies Ummm... Joffrey is a bastard. He is Jamies son.
screenjunkies I actually wish they would show more of Brans plot. Its misterious and interesting and I really want to know where its headed.
screenjunkies i feel like theon deserved to get his dick cut off

screenjunkies DO AN AMERICAN HORROR STORY TRAILER
screenjunkies secret life of walter mitty!
screenjunkies Do percy Jackson!!!!!
screenjunkies Compared to the 2012 teen drama turtles that are airing right now. This Should be like 100x better.Now if someone made a dark gritty Turtles closer of the original comics that be cool but my hopes are low. Although all the blood is now acceptable in movies now unlike when the first Movies were made.
screenjunkies Not going pay to see this after I heard Shredder is not who he is supposed to be
screenjunkies I am neutral.I will judge it when i see it.
screenjunkies This is the first time Ive seen anything about the new Turtle movie and it seems just like a transformers movie. And why the hell is Megan Fox in this movie? Is Bay dating her or something?
screenjunkies Omg if they are bringing Bebop and Rocksteady into this, I am already sold on going to see it!
screenjunkies My nerdy two cents: I grew up with the Turtles as a kid in the mid80s, I am excited and in no way worried about this ruining the franchise. Ill be there in opening night. My only beef with Micael Bays Transformers was that all that amazingly detailed CGI couldnt be appreciated because the action scenes were happening so fast Im sure this will be the same way. How can you not love any incarnation of TMNT? The mythos of ninja, the enchantment of Super Heroes  their moral obligation, and the fantasy element that allows this series to go in a hundred different directions. Im sure there will be a degree of cheese in the film, but I do like the way there is a bit of visceral, dark, grittiness to this version. I will say though, that the Turtles faces look a bit too human but Ill get over it. So excited about this! :)
screenjunkies you guys are not freaking fans your idiots
screenjunkies Dont forget to screw up M.A.S.K , Voltron, Thunder Cats,  Silverhawks (google it) while you guys are at it. I really did not enjoy Robocop and this might be going that same way too
screenjunkies daamn that nigger is fat
screenjunkies Im predicting a 6.4 Imdb 49 Rotten TomatoesAlthough, i will probably end up liking it even if it is panned.I dont mind some cheese on my movies if the idea is interesting.
screenjunkies foreshadowing...THE AVENGERS! introducing the plot device for...THE AVENGERS! unnecessarily freezing himself so he can be in...THE AVENGERS! a post credits scene thats literately a trailer for...THE AVENGERS!
screenjunkies I Just Watched Captain America The Winter Soldier! And It Prepares us For The Avengers...! 2!!!, And It Uses Hes Ultimate Power! Talking! And There know Tablet And phone pressing and Mouse Scrolling
screenjunkies The Winter Spoiler!! xD
screenjunkies Do Captain America 2!!!!

screenjunkies The rape scene in clockwork orange
screenjunkies ALSO WHEN IN JURASSIC PARK THAT DINOSOAR LIKE EATS THE COW THING AND YOU CAN HEAR IT LIKE NOOOO
screenjunkies The end scene from the film Freaks where they chase the woman through the mud! (I think its from the 30s) I watched that one night when I was 7 and stayed up late. I didnt sleep at all that night.
screenjunkies Alien the scene where the guy is giving birth tho the baby alien
screenjunkies Rock rape from Cannibal Holocaust.
screenjunkies This one should really have had a clearer warning up front about what you meant by Fed up scenes. I was expecting something entirely different from most nightmareinspiring scenes you dont want to watch just before going to sleep
screenjunkies Justin Bieber entire movie
screenjunkies Honest Action: Elysium.
screenjunkies Id like to point out how Die Hard movies 35 have more deaths of John McClain individually as movies than 1 or 2.
screenjunkies The Mission: Impossible series is begging for this treatment.
screenjunkies Even on the account that all abrasions are subject to a virtual reality theory, possibly Scott Pilgrim VS The World Please.
screenjunkies Do mission impossible and more specifically mission impossible 2 the fight scene at the end was just ridiculous and hunt in real life wouldve easily been killed.
screenjunkies do RESIDENT EVIL 15 no matter how freak alice was... really? she has survived everything?
screenjunkies Make more of these!!!!
screenjunkies I swear give devil may cry or beyonetta hell even asuras wrath to the creator of attack on titan the anime you will have amazing movies
screenjunkies skyrim or final fantasy vi but my top would be masters of orion 2
screenjunkies as a child i loved the mario movie. not for any cinematic reasons just as a kid i loved it.
screenjunkies Borderlands but with a group of vault hunters not seen before would be the best idea for a video game movie but it would be hard to do well.
screenjunkies I really hope they dont fuck up the Assassins Creed movie. If they do it right, theyll have access to so much lore and spinoff material and mythology creation, as well as the sheer number of settings and possibilities they can utilize.
screenjunkies Anyone else think the one guy sounded lik Kermit the frog
screenjunkies I would love to see a Star Wars film based of KOTOR with Revan.
screenjunkies assasins creed maybe? (number 2)
screenjunkies You must do Rise of The Guardians! Please!

screenjunkies I have two issues with the trailer. First, its not funny (is the main character supposed to be stupid?). Second, STOP the grey looking movies please, one Nolan is way enough for our planet.
screenjunkies Why didnt they mention that Draxs only reason for existing is to kill Thanos?
screenjunkies It will pop...raccoon  tree  magnificence
screenjunkies I was sold to this movie after talking rakoon with guns show up.....
screenjunkies I was surprised when this movie was announced and I cant wait to see it. The guardians of the galaxy is like a rag tag team of rebels, everything youd expect them to do theyll do in an unorthodox method. Hopefully the amount of characters doesnt hinder the fighting scenes, cause recent captain America: the winter soldier had amazing fight scenes compared to avengers which had mainly like repulser shooting, hammer throwing, hulk smashing and captain America shielding for the most part.
screenjunkies if one was going to start reading the comics where do you begin?
screenjunkies Ive been trying to find out when this is coming out in Finland, but at the moment it seems like its not gonna come here at all...
screenjunkies can someone post a link to the picture they have in the video of the cosmic superheros as well as Ultron and Thanos at 6:09.
screenjunkies This is hilarious and mainly true!!
screenjunkies If ONLY Ripley was there.
screenjunkies I absolutely lost my shit at incompetent ripley XD
screenjunkies this is the worst honest review, mostly because the movie is infallible.
screenjunkies Starring Gus Fring, haha...
screenjunkies this is the end please
screenjunkies Am I the only one who thought this movie sucks, and I watched it in the cinema.
retrogametech Do you take fan mail? Got an Atari 2600 av mod kit thats not getting used. :P
retrogametech Theres a retro shop on ebay trying to sell one with one game for 150... good luck.. Theres one with no bids at 89 with a nice multicart like the one on Ashens video.
retrogametech Great vid  well done!
retrogametech I need help how can I clean n64 game to make it works again can someone help
retrogametech dont you love fools on ebay
retrogametech Do you need a controller for this?
retrogametech well worth it, great deal dude, any chance you could show how to do an av mod on the original white pc engine please.
retrogametech Lucky sun of a..:D Im just in midle of building almost the whole system again to get one back to life. And need to make some Snes controllers for it. I recommend to buy some multicarts and dumper from hackermesh and a 3d glasses from madtronix ) And remember to discharge the CRT when you start to mess with it :D
retrogametech I think you got extremely lucky on only the power plug being faulty. With the age of the machine (32 years!), I was thinking it was going to be hell to repair. Great video though!Im wondering if youll eventually try to score a faulty Xbox OnePS4 to repair and sell on for profit (or keep). Do you think you could try it, or would it be too expensive to gamble on right now?
retrogametech Crap! Somebody beat me to the blue balls..... that did not sound right.
retrogametech I feel sorry for tales
retrogametech Hey man, any chance of adding me as a contact, need to PM you some things ?
retrogametech If I was you martin, Id go out and buy a scratch card, abd also enter the comp on this morning! Lol also just realised you look abit like the lead singer from bullet for my valentine.
retrogametech Could you tell me where exactly u got them from?? Pls..
retrogametech Great video man! I was just thinking about doing a review on my channel of this full set  and saw that you beat me to the punch, lol. Great pickups man! Such a cool little set. Keep up the great videos!
retrogametech N GAGE! Why do you taunt me?! I just cant seem to get one that works.Hmm no wireless adapter for the GBA? I would have thought you would have had one of those by now.If that is the same movie player that my friend has, it is interesting, but not very useful.Nice box of stuff.
retrogametech Wow I really want that first black GameBoy SP you pulled out of the blue case, Ive always wanted one.But I understand its part of your collection and I wont even bother asking if you would sell it.Beyond that like you said at the beginning YouTubes Content ID BS has killed 80 of the YouTubers I watch, kinda sad when YouTube has pretty much replaced broadcast TV for me.
retrogametech Youre genuinely one of my favourite youtubers, You inspired me to fix faulty consoles and i know have 2 PS3s (One being backwards compatible), 2 DSs, a DSI and an SP. Couldnt be happier with my new hobby :) as long as keep making videos, ill keep watching them even with shitty google.
retrogametech Ive only started watching the last few months buy your eBay repair videos really helped me repair my gameboys awesome vids!
retrogametech Good vids new subscriber :p
retrogametech i Hope you keep making videos! :D i Love the repair videos! i have maybe watched your repair videos about 110times :) haha Keep The Good Work up! I totally understand if you dont have the time !
retrogametech I love your videos, thank you for staying and uploading.
retrogametech Can you fix anything?
retrogametech thats alot of gameboys lol, i just bought a backlit sp off my friend for 5 that freezes all the time and i plan on putting the screen in an original gba cause the controls are nicer cause there on the outside
retrogametech Yay! I recommended GBWriter! But to start with it didnt work for you, what changed?
retrogametech Hey man .... ! r you allryt ???! I realy enjoy youre videos , i grou up with retro games , pyss man .
retrogametech Awesome stuff! I just recently started getting into GB and GBA got about 13 games for mine now, Is there a card with a higher capacity or is 128 the max?
retrogametech where did u get the smartcard
retrogametech Plus the GBA seems like a good size for something like a multi format emulatorgame machine.
retrogametech Aaa hi see! I did wonder about the patching, its nice to know it will still work (without saving) in the event all the XP computers in the world get recycled! Also I wish I could reply but Apple decided for some reason its not an important feature to put into their iPad YouTube app :)
retrogametech HI Martin, Try googleling EWIN Client v0.72a and see if that works with your Flashcart?
retrogametech i baught a supercard sd a while ago, and i have the same problem
retrogametech Run a search on GBATemp or pop the question on their forums.
retrogametech Have heard that EZFlash advance drivers can work with this. Tried any of these? http:www.ezfadvance.comEZFlashSoftwareDrivers.htm hope it helps
retrogametech Cool stuff! BTW, I was pretty startled when i saw in 4:11 sticker with description in Polish PLOMBA! NIE ZRYWA! witch means Seal! Do not break! :)
retrogametech Im pretty sure my mate Gazz had one of these. it came with a cd with the drivers and software on which if I recall his pcs antivirus would go nuts everytime he used it.
retrogametech Hey, Ive been watching you for a while, I really enjoy your videos and your ebay pickups. I just watched your video about the Smart Card. Sadly I dont have one nor do i know where to get the software. But I do have a method to get your saves from your GBA carts to your pc and back again.What you needGBA gameDS flash card.DS or DS Lite with slot 2and this software for the flashcart http:filetrip.netndsdownloadsapplicationsdownloadgbabackuptool021f3228.htmlessentially what you do is boot up the software using your ds flash cart ak2i, r4 m3 or whatever.It will ask you to set a target card in slot 2the instructionsB creates a backup of the save to your micro SD cardX s to change the cartridge as in replace it for anotherso you can backup or restore another safeR changes the instructionsand the rest is self explanatory.You can do this do even make backups of the romsthis way you can have your saves across different cartridgesand flash carts.MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT UPLOAD THE WRONG SAVE TO THE WRONG CARTRIDGEas in advance wars to pokemon as it could possibly ruin the cartridge.And I just wanted to thank you for your awesome videos!also I have a question for you, do you know where i could get a graphite shell for a gba sp, I cant stand the onyx color ones.Is there any way to remove light scratches from the plastic?Thanks!
retrogametech May i ask retrogametech do bootleg games work as good as the non bootleg ones?
retrogametech Pretty cool :D Wonder whats inside the hyper neo 64 carts apart from ROMs?
retrogametech Nice bootlegs! I have a couple of bootlegs, mostly Chinese. I think them ones are Korean.
retrogametech Game Boy Advance died but my GameCube has a Game Boy Advance port ad on
retrogametech Super shibby! Now, I dont know if its just me, but your videos seem to be quieter than most. I dont know if its just your voice, or what, but I find myself having to listen really hard when watching your videos on my phone. Just thought Id mention it.
retrogametech I find that most ebay sellers are completely (and genuinely) oblivious to the fact their games are bootlegs. Theyre normally easy to spot so long as the photo is clear.
retrogametech Quality games. They definitely hold their value and are pretty sought after titles.
retrogametech Thanks. It takes a bit more effort but Im going to try and do more like this. :)
retrogametech Thanks. I use a combination of Movie maker and Vegas.
retrogametech Was never really a fan of the gba but, after seeing some of these ganes you picked up I might have to track them down! The Micro Machines and Lilo and Stitch look ace : D
retrogametech Got to love the GBA. Has a huge library of games and tons of real hidden gems!
retrogametech My set up is very simpistic, I dont think its worth a vid. Right now I have my ps3 and Wii u plugged into a 32 inch tv and my wii and ps2 plugged into an old Sanyo tv. I mostly play ps2 games and 3ds games, Im happy with my current systems but I really want a dreamcast D:
retrogametech looks really organized :). My setup almost looks identical cept its two ps3s instead of two 360s ha. NES, SMS, dreamcast, ps2, gc, 64, softmod XBOX, odyssey, and colecovision. I really want to make these old games look better on my hdtv but I cant justify spending the money on any kind of a kit until after I get a neo geo ). take care man really enjoy the videos
retrogametech Please do a 2014 gaming setup
retrogametech I have made my video and uploaded it Martin :) please check it out if you get to see this message :)
retrogametech Even at 10 Im not so sure it was worth it! haha. Your local store is the Fort isnt it? If you ask the staff, I bet you theyll say they have a ton of the things sitting through the back. I cant believe people were paying over 100 for it on release! The voice commands are kinda cool for navigating the dash when it (sometimes) understands you. But like you say its really nothing new. I remember giving voice commands to my squad in Ghost Recon on the original Xbox through the Live mic!
retrogametech Haha thanks, dude! I wouldnt say it was anywhere near the greatest but Im happy with it :) . I would prefer to have a dedicated room like youve got with some cabs and a sofa etc. That would be epic! haha Thanks for watching and commenting as always! :)
retrogametech I did a room tour showing my current setup etc.if ya wanna stop by
retrogametech Ive been thinking about getting a modded 360, but I just dont trust they will last that long at all... Shame really as they are very reasonably priced here nowadays.
retrogametech I thought a dongle thing was needed to mess about downgrading to old FW in order to run custom FW?
retrogametech This channel is the of the best quality! I love it!!! Please continue recording and uploading. I support you.
retrogametech hey is there any chance you would sell that pink lancer? ill buy :D
retrogametech Lol, thats awesome! Did he sound like him when speaking normally? The first Gears of War is one of my favourite 360 titles.
retrogametech Was the Dream Eye designed to be utilized during game play, or just for web chatting? An interesting accessory for the time either way. I dont see any rings on those mats. Ill bet you bought the hot pink version because it matched your shoes ) I would have expected the miniature Mega Drive and accessories to make an appearance. Thanks for the response Martin :)
retrogametech I got one of these a while back, and all 3 games they ever released, Im toying with the idea of the racing board as well if one comes up, but i have so much snk hardware now i dont know if its worth it! jamma definately makes life easier on these boards too. nice video, thanks for sharing :)
retrogametech :) Thanks for the heads up on them.
retrogametech Lol, cheap, indestructible and awesome 90s style! :)
retrogametech please give that ebayers name!
retrogametech Haha, the remaining stock didnt last long after I posted this vid!
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech 8:08 One of those voices sounds EXACTLY like adult Link. Looked it up, and yep, Nobuyuki Hiyama usually voices Joe Higashi. Man, that guy gets around. I remember when I first found the Japanese voices on Soul Caliber 2 and noticed that Siegfried, Link, and Yoshimitsu all had the EXACT same voice. I mean just about pitch perfect the same. How does this guy get so much work doing the exact same voice?
retrogametech Thanks! I appreciate you taking the time to watch them! :)
retrogametech Sorry, the hardware is very solid and heavy and looks cool, the problem is the games are preeeetty crappy. Roads Edge was good for its time, Fatal Fury Wild Ambition looks cool enough but Ive never played it, Sam Sho 64 I had (crap), Buriki One I have never played but looks somewhat interesting. Meh. SNK couldve done way better with it, or not made it at all and made better 2D games with the millions they wasted on HNG64 development.
retrogametech How did you go about fixing the battery compartment? Ive noticed with xbox 360 controllers especially the specially branded ones the battery compartment is faulty every single one Ive purchased whenever I used rechargeable battery packs it would cause the compartment to crack in the same areas you pointed out.Super glue wasnt enough of a repair since rechargeable battery packs would just pop the crack again so Ive actually started using a single ply toilet papersuper glue combination where I would use a bit of the of the glue then place the toilet paper on the area then I would apply layers of toilet paper and super glue giving me a sort of hard skin like an epoxy but far easier to apply, Id then let it cure for a few days sand a little and paint to match colors.
retrogametech I do the exact same sink job with my controllers, washingup liquid is my favored cleaner.
retrogametech Another great repair video. Thanks Martin!
retrogametech Nice! The simple fixes are always the best :)
retrogametech I doubt they care tbh. Unless they had all the tools, parts and spare time required to repair it then it was just junk to then anyway. They got some money for it which was a bonus. A lot of people just dont look after or take care of their stuff to begin with.
retrogametech Well I dont use a dishwasher but do frequently throw entire motherboards into the bath. All my Neo Geo boards have been cleaned this way :). It seems wrong at first but its perfectly safe. Youve just got to 100 dry them before firing them up again.
retrogametech Ah YouTube, always coming up with these innovative and handy new features :P. I couldnt see the comments on my own video until several hours after Id uploaded. I heard they were planning to make video comments only available to those with a Google account! This site is becoming less and less user friendly IMHO. I wish there was a good community based and less adrevenue focused alternative.
retrogametech Thanks. The MVS project is exactly where I left it :P . Ive been playing it a lot but too lazy to properly consolize it. Soon! :P
retrogametech Does the 32x work on clones like this?
retrogametech Thanks for doing this review! Ive been looking at the console on ebay, but was holding off, as I was unsure if it was a MDOAC now I know, Ill pass. Those new boxed Megadrives from Thailand are looking mighty tempting, now...
retrogametech Can you imagine if the original mega drive was that small on release, it would have blown minds.
retrogametech I bough one of these several weeks ago  the button on the left is for overclocking to 10mhz
retrogametech they should make neo geo clones for once
retrogametech Does it run Overdrive? :P
retrogametech I knew it was only a matter of time before someone made that joke :P
retrogametech lol at the bit at the end. Surprising that even in 2010 they wereare still producing Megadrive clones.
retrogametech I dont always have the time to make videos. Other times I just dont feel like it or prefer to spend my free time doing other hobbies. Making vids isnt as easy as you might think :P
retrogametech Not really my kind of thing. Im still holding out for a good deal to upgrade to a black 3DS XL :)
retrogametech If they intermingled then what would be the point of having different forms of ebay.
retrogametech How much are the godzilla vmu worth?
retrogametech Niw i going to try to find a faulty sky box for a 500gb Hdd :) Nice video again
retrogametech Haha, coincidence :) . Thanks for supporting the channel!
retrogametech Why dont you do a challenge playlist ? Try and fix peoples broken consoles. I enjoyed the first one. I love your channel very geeky and nerdy and interesting. Make some more vids ?
retrogametech Actually they do if the seller has selected to ship worldwide. You can adjust your search results to include international sellers. But if you really want to see everything then yeah its best to visit the individual sites .com .co.uk .de etc
retrogametech Those things hold 500 Gigs? Wow. I use up all the storage in them in a few weeks...
retrogametech finally another pickup video
retrogametech i think the yellow gameboy its a custom one, notice it lacks the nintendo label below the screen
retrogametech Wow. I never knew of this pokemon mini.
retrogametech i picked up devil may cry 3 complete with the manual and the monster hunter demo disc for 49p in cash generator, and it was in amazing condition too. nice vid btw!
retrogametech That GB Transfer would be amazing. My Pokemon Red battery still holds a charge and has my save from 1998. I need to get that off there somehow.
retrogametech Martin, Id love to see your retro PC game collection and what sort of system you use to play old games with. Also would like to see the pictures you pulled off the GB Camera (if theyre not personal).
retrogametech hey i was wondering how to save data on games like super mario land and Go Go Tank
retrogametech I did vaguely because my Pojos Unofficial Pokemon trading card book made a mention of them and had a picture, still have that book and I dont know why.
retrogametech what do you mean by faulty as in a fake replica?
retrogametech The day u done this video it was my birthday
retrogametech I loved guitar hero on tour
retrogametech aaah, lovely 101s.. the greatest handheld ever in the world part 21 fact.
retrogametech if I import that model of the gba into the US, will I have problems playing my US game boy games because of the region stuff
retrogametech Would you believe me if I said I have an Onyx colored AGS101? :P
retrogametech Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, oi,oi,oi!
retrogametech Will the Aus GBA SP 001 charger work with a US or EU GBA SP 101?
retrogametech You really need to get that thing up and running again! I thought you were sending it off to get fixed?
retrogametech Sounds proper nasty and makes you wonder what the hell people do with their consoles! Had the same with a Model 1 MegaDrive I picked up.... EXT port was rusting a bit and the outer shell was absolutely disgutingly bad.... All cleaned and shined up nicely in the end!
retrogametech I bought one last week which was fully modded, eg, bios chip, LED under the reset button, Svideo and stereo connectors, it was 550 Australian. My standard one was about 180 Australian. Both came with a controller and power supply.
retrogametech I love watching yer videos, think your a legend lol. Are you all self taught? I got a bunch of old consoles in storage I want to clean up and repair but no idea where to start. Plus I would like to thank you, I watched the video of you finding the wrecked cars and finding a geocache. I went and researched Geocaching and now in love with it lol so cheers m8 :)
retrogametech Pro tip.. Never ever put ICs in just regular foam like that.. the chance of killing the IC is far greater than having it laying naked on a desk..
retrogametech You should have seen the underside of that board before I cleaned it up! It was nasty to say the least. Im surprised it was booting at all! But not a bad return on my initial 21 investment :) You got more faulty boxes? Cool, definitely do some vlogs on those! Thanks for watching dude!
retrogametech wow, do you really have real cartridge Shantae for GBC twice time? damn you! :)
retrogametech You own 2 copies of shantae? How?
retrogametech Could you recommend some GB Cards? Any Names?
retrogametech Cool, no not tried the GG ports yet. Good to know you can run them in native res though!
retrogametech RetroGameTech This question has been bugging me for a while now. In Shantae for the 3DS, did you get to Bandit Town yet? If you have, is there a building called Advanced Genies that you can enter and inside there is a guy who offers to sell you a secret for 500 gems? Thanks for listening!
retrogametech One of the best 8bit games ever made!
retrogametech Thanks for answering. Im pretty bummed now though that i need like 200 to buy my own.
retrogametech I think heshe means before you click on any game on the 3DS theres an manual option in the bottom left corner. Never seen this info in the manual, so thanks for the video :)
retrogametech Not bad considering it was never designed to do what you done with it, I had one of those a few years ago I paid 45 for it just because its supposed to be able to play japNTSC games, great vid :)
retrogametech Thanks. Would have like to get it running properly. Close enough I suppose. :P
retrogametech great channel mate i really enjoy watching them,is it hard to fix these game systems like you do as im a collector of games but after watching you i thinking og doing a few up thanks again andy
retrogametech You had one? Thats cool. Where did you find yours? Did it have the second slot fitted? Still got it by any chance?
retrogametech Not sure why your last comment was removed. It just says Comment removed  Author withheld? However, I sadly dont have the skills or the equipment for that level of tinkering. Thanks for watching and commenting! :)
retrogametech i saw the comment now thanks for replying to my complaint and i guess there is nothing you can do so oh well but thanks i am going to try and watch the video now
retrogametech awesome ideas you have dude:)
retrogametech ...cont. Also not sure if you mentioned...Will a regular MD game work through the 32X on it?
retrogametech i only like mario kart
retrogametech Im not sure what kind of release it got, but SEGA has an Arcade Collection on the Wii with LA Machine Guns and Gunblade NY on it. You can probably find it cheap. They are direct ports of the arcade versions. Theyre not super super amazing, but they are cool light gun games on the system, and they are definitely really fun to play. :)
retrogametech Sonic Colors. Mario Kart for sure. Both Galaxy 1 and 2. Red Steel 2. Uhhh never played many 3rd party games on the Wii.
retrogametech Id say xenoblade, but finding a cheap copy will be pretty difficult.
retrogametech Great channel, especially when you repair consoles! but now Wii is Retro? JK
retrogametech Heinz Wolfes Gravity is a really fun puzzle game. Metroid Prime Trilogy if you can find it. Theres also ports of Samba De Amigo  that Donkey Kong bongo game. Rogue Trooper is a fun 3rd person shooter ported from PS2. Theres also a stack of PC adventure games, usually Sherlock Holmes or Agatha Christie. I would suggest Batman: Brave  the Bold but you already have it. However, the DS version of Thor is also by Way Forward
retrogametech House of the Dead Overkill  very funny, adult shooter. In the Guiness Records for most swearing in a video game. Mad World is also great.
retrogametech i have plans to do the same.. already got a very small collection of wii games, but its somethin im gonna get into again at some point.. not got the console at the moment, but soon, no doubt.. i played epic mickey 2 and that seemed cool so i expect the first is decent too. never heard of mushroom men, or a few of the others.. ill use this vid as a reference for collecting, so i will!
retrogametech Haha, years ahead of you dude! That was the first thing I did when I originally bought the thing. :P
retrogametech if you can find it cheap try out eledees, its a game where you have to find these little creatures hidden all over a house by picking up items with a gravity gun style weapon, actually a lot of fun
retrogametech Nintendo MP3 players really made the GBA and early DS systems look like a deformed Siamese twin! And ya know, I never heard about any other MP3 player cartridge for GBADS that was ever capable of a shuffle mode with savestating. But to be fair, most MP3 players dont support poweroff savestating.
retrogametech is that sp a ags101 nice.
retrogametech Powerglove is actually a catchy song (especially with those stick figures dancing in the background.
retrogametech the flashcard I have can play music but its harder to use it because you need the earphone adapter, and it doesnt look as cool as this one
retrogametech Im not sure but its a bit strange. Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech That is a very neat little device. The timing on this item seems a little late for the mp3 rush from what I can tell. In the US we had cell phones that would have 50 addon units that would make it able to play mp3 files. This also seems to only have come out in the UK, or at least all the pricing hints at that. Nice find for 98 and probably a cool conversation piece.
retrogametech Thats interesting, I just looked up the Playyan and it looks identical. Only difference is this one doesnt do video. I wonder why they cut that feature from the Euro release.
retrogametech It does seem a little late for such a device but I suppose thats why it isnt very well known. If it was marketed towards DS owners then maybe it was a response to the multimedia features of the PSP?
retrogametech in the bad influence video, they said you probably wouldnt find it at most legit stores, and that unofficial products arent the best idea.
retrogametech Secret door is perfect for Mega Everdrive Cart
retrogametech Thanks for watching and commenting :)
retrogametech very cool. never even heard of this.. dayum.. if you can fix the rgb  60htz issues, you might well have the ultimate mega drive there lol.
retrogametech Wow. Very cool console there. One of the coolest bootleg consoles Ive ever seen. The circut board even looks like a real Mega Drive circut board. :)
retrogametech online play?? the modem still works?
retrogametech The instructions seem to point to at least a western distributor.
retrogametech OMG thats what those controllers came from! i bought one of those controllers at the flea market here in the US thinking it was a 6 button but it wasnt!
retrogametech I believe they screwed up the cable that they made, all it is is moving audiovisual data, nothing else, so it shouldnt be too complicated. Also I know Violet Berlin IRL if you want me to forward it if youre successful :D
retrogametech That would be very dull :P. The only game related stuff on display is my console setup. Everything else is hidden from view or in storage.
retrogametech Theyre like red rags to a bull IMO :P
retrogametech You should look into getting an MVS :)
retrogametech here I know this might sound stupid but I want to buy a Gameboy advanced from ebay but I am afraid that it might be a scam. would I be able to buy one of you.... email me............ ratedmodzgmail.com
retrogametech Thanks :). Ill drop you a PM when I get round to selling them :)
retrogametech thanks. lets give it a try then. now the only problem is finding a connector then.
retrogametech Haha, I just carpet bomb ebay with low bids and every now and then someone else forgets to bid :P
retrogametech Thanks! I really appreciate that :)
retrogametech Parcel force, and royal mail in a nutshell
retrogametech Not much space wasted there. Wow, Double Dash looks much better now.
retrogametech Haha, that might well be true if I ran everything at the same time :P
retrogametech Ahh kewl, thanks for clearing that up for me.
retrogametech Sorted man that looks nice and crisp. I jacked the wii in as i couldnt get a good enough picture then i see yours and now i want another one, not to worry car boot on sunday theres always one up there lol
retrogametech The original Xbox looks really bad through the scaler. The Xbox outputs a good widescreen HD image over component as it is so adding the scaler just makes it look horrible.
retrogametech It sucks that you cant call the original Xbox the Xbox 1 anymore.
retrogametech Thanks. I should paint the broom handle to match :P
retrogametech Oh my god I love the music in this video!
retrogametech Woah, you got an Xbox One already?
retrogametech wow, the wii looks sexy through your upscaler  the scan lines add a nice effect! i bought one of those wii2hdmi  what a piece of shite! looked better with my old leads. i was really disappointed with hotd3 on xbox as you can not turn off the auto reload feature? i cant play it like that  i wasnt too impressed with wii gun games as the cursor is a little late to response, anyway good vid bro  you got lots to play through  some more nice weather on the way!
retrogametech Id be interested to see more of your gameboygba games. Both have a great choice of games, with most of them being pretty cheap. Unless you go for the CIB ones, like me!
retrogametech when did you get a slim
retrogametech Panasonic SD60 camcorder :)
retrogametech with what are you recording?
retrogametech Not yet but its due for release very soon :). But I have it on my GB USB Smart card so I can play it on my GBC anyway. Id love to get the original cart and complete the collection. Failing that Im going to make my own repro :)
retrogametech Thanks, glad you like the vids! :) I use a Panasonic HDCSD60 for most of my vids. Very user friendly camera :)
retrogametech Haha, Its all the same to me, dude.
retrogametech great video man, what do you do for a living whats your job youre probly like a scientist ??
retrogametech That is insanely impressive, to be able to get something that nackered to work perfectly again!
retrogametech Damn, I have a Japanese mega drive which stopped working when it fell off a table years ago. I was going to ask the same thing of you dude :(
retrogametech Looks like there may have been a few more people inside that thing since the original conversion.
retrogametech Very well done, I imagine the crack developed due to the PAL convertor helping himself to half of the components back then and the megadrive running for years with their bodge job.
retrogametech Haha, when I turned the board over for the first time and saw all the damage I did consider emailing Daz to say it was dead :P
retrogametech Thanks! Glad you enjoy the vids and find them useful :)
retrogametech Nothing is made like this anymore! Sad really.
retrogametech oh no its notmine was only split in 1 cornerwhoops
retrogametech Looks like the same microswitch in the snes mouse.
retrogametech Thanks for your video, i have repared my controller!!!! YES
retrogametech You might not have noticed but Im a thrifty bastard when it comes to my gaming hobbies. I like to lag at least 5 years behind the current gen of consoles where prices are reasonable :P . So unless I find someone selling one for under 40 in the next few weeks, I doubt Ill be doing Wii U related vids any time soon, :P. Thanks for the suggestion though :)
retrogametech do you need to wear an antistatic wrist band to fix consoles and other electronics?
retrogametech manufacturers like SNK often rebadge off the shelf components I know NEC did this in the turbografx. SNK wouldnt waste money tooling new machines for a slightly different component, it might be an obscure part but its probably out there.ps big fan of the show keep it up :D
retrogametech HEY I KNOW YOU!! FROM ASHENS!!!
retrogametech Where did you acquire your MVS?
retrogametech They usually just get pinched so they just need to be reseated and they pop up just fine.
retrogametech For just over 10 I cant complain :) . Never tried the AES sticks but Id really love to pick one up sometime. Neo Geo accessories can get pretty expensive!
retrogametech In fact there IS a retail version of this game available for purchase, although only for the PC version of the game. It contains the installation disc, the soundtrack on CD and also a Blood Dragon poster. Nevertheless: Great job on the box! I might do the same with my (digital) version. :D
retrogametech You can install a small hardrive (or just a usb stick) into a megadrive cartridge and put the game on that, and then you would have a physical copy of the game. Quite a bit of work though.
retrogametech Thank. The game is great fun. Im sure youll enjoy it :)
retrogametech A nice idea. Executed well. Good stuff Martin
retrogametech Nice idea, but I think I would have done it without the SEGA and the MegaDrive logos. Instead of those I would have used the logos for either PC, XBOX, or PS3. Using the Sega logo just comes out of place since it isnt for that system. I know your parodying a SEGAMegaDrive cart, but just doesnt look right with those logos IMHO.
retrogametech Thats a GREAT idea and original
retrogametech That is so damn cool!
retrogametech You ever have that cartridge which downloaded games every month or week? Know the name of that?
retrogametech Its funny how Sega were innovating in the 90s with online play, whereas Nintendo struggle even now in 2013... :)
retrogametech I was wondering how long it would take for someone to notice that. :P
retrogametech Cool , you love your Mega drive :)
retrogametech Brilliant loved the number you put in at the end 8008135  Boobies xD
retrogametech Sega was so Great and Brave .
retrogametech Also, you should do a video talking about the Sega Pluto Saturn prototype It looked way cooler and thinner than the current saturn with everything the Saturn has except it had a built in Modem!
retrogametech if this woulda cought on big we would be in the Matrix by now. Damn you Sony and slowing down evolution
retrogametech it is utterly fuckin mental that the mega drive was online. chickin lickin, budgie flickin, granny brickin M.E.N.T.A.L. next youll be tellin us the master system had 3D!! )
retrogametech if you want I give you tips to have best console version or best screen better than normal crt...
retrogametech Its great isnt it! :)
retrogametech Whereabouts in Scotland you from? Im in Kilmarnock if you have heard of it :)
retrogametech Very nice!! My Goodmans 14 inch TV probably has a service menu and no one will ever know what it is so the picture is wrong forever :(
retrogametech You make a valid argument for modern televisions, but I still think youre crazy )
retrogametech you would want your composite, svideo,component all through 1 wire? so you can hook up 1 thing to composite and another to component? i am glad it never came here. i like how there are so many connections.
retrogametech Its odd. I have another Trinitron from the same range only larger and it shows scanlines with all my systems by default confused. I think this smaller one must be upscaling or something like you suggest. It is pixel perfect and lovely to look at though! xD
retrogametech Cool! I got a sony trinitron with a larger tube. That code does not work on my tv. Where did you find it?
retrogametech i wish i could afford one
retrogametech The scanlines basically cuts off half of every pixel. The black space left behind makes it look less blocky because your brain fills in the rest.
retrogametech There are certain effectscharacteristics an arcade CRT has which arent recreated on an LCD (by default). Scalines are one of them :) .
retrogametech Thats where I got mine )
retrogametech oh I know, but I have all the older systems as well, was thinking of the Genesis, as it does not want to play nice with my AV to VGA converter p
retrogametech I always play retro games on a small 14 inch crt tv, so i dont really see the scanline spaces, the beam is too thick to leave gaps. on a bigger tv on the other hand, like 20 inches or if you stand really close to the action like with an arcade cabinet its more distinct. i have never seen scanlines as the biggest difference between crt and lcd tvs, its something else. for me maybe its more about the colors, lack of lag, that theres no native resolutions and the analog feel of it.
retrogametech I dont see the appeal either nor did any of my consoles have them
retrogametech i cant remember them being this pronounced either.
retrogametech I wonder how hard it would be to make an all in one, box to house that scan line generator, a VGA Box, and the arcade upscaler thingy.... mmmmmmm
retrogametech With slg axel is still blocky, but hes also SWAG
retrogametech where did you get that black case for your ngage, ive been looking for a black replacement case for my ngage qd but cant find any
retrogametech that was the greatest thing Ive ever seen, I remember I found some strange modem made by a 3rd party company for super Nintendo that would play a few football games online but I cant say Ive ever seen the real Sega megadrive modem in action
retrogametech Wow old retro still surprises me :)
retrogametech Are you paying for service on the Ngage, or can it just accept calls without a carrier now? oo
retrogametech Incredible that you managed to make the Genesis modem work! I cant even manage to get my Dreamcast online for Phantasy Star Online...how can you tell if you have a phone line in your house?
retrogametech Its funny how back in the day PCPC via modem was totally normal way to play games with your friends yet Snes, Genesis, Etc took them upto Xbox days to really get into multiplayer games. I think that if they would have really fleshed out good stable modems for old 16bit consoles wed be living in a slightly different world today. But still I was doing that stuff on my PC and people made fun of me... Funny how that works now a days.
retrogametech how would you talk with no mic
retrogametech I suppose online console gaming was just too ahead of its time at that point. Its interesting to think how things might be different today if it had been more successful.
retrogametech That was pretty mental.
retrogametech OH MY GOD! YOU WERE DRIVING ON ThE WRONG LANE ALL THE TIME!
retrogametech Snow days are a great excuse to stay in and play video games! xD
retrogametech Curse you global warming! Oh its snowing, nevermind... Only time Ive ditched my car was on a sleet covered road so be careful.
retrogametech PlayStation 4 graphics, Believe!
retrogametech I enjoyed this more than I should. Perfect music match for your ride. Also gives me a chance to see a country Id love to see in person one day. :)
retrogametech What a great road! I do want to put you in the other lane though.
retrogametech Looks pretty cool up there! Not much sign of spring here either!
retrogametech lovely weather, 3 years ago i went up Ben Nevis the thick snow reminds me of an old Amiga RPG Ishar 2 (i hummed the theme tune in my head to keep my attention away from the fact it was very in cold in Scotland lol)
retrogametech That happened to my 3DS 1.5 months after I purchased it. It was under warranty so I returned it and gave me a new one because they couldnt fix it.
retrogametech How did you learn how to fix Nintendo systems or any system
retrogametech It cost 35.00 cash for the 3ds and he fix it wow if was him I would keep it
retrogametech Great video, as always dude :)
retrogametech Well I kinda got lucky on this one I think :P . Normally they sell for a bit more.
retrogametech I have a question do you know what does bootrom error mean I bought a 3ds from ebay and thats the error it has along with a blue screen?????????
retrogametech I love those lime green DSLs! I have one myself :). They look even coolervibrant in real life!
retrogametech nice totally worth it. im gonna look for a 3ds with this problem now :D thnx
retrogametech How many ngage models are there?
retrogametech can we still download cmr 2005 on n.gage after so long?
retrogametech I wana see gameplay for all the rpgstrategy type games.
retrogametech Google a guy named AdamKoralik. He has a MASSIVE Dreamcast collection, maybe some stuff arent as rare as others, but he has EVERY.. Every.... Dreamcast game. Cool guy.
retrogametech wow never knew xanadu next was released, from what it looked like it felt like a beta version
retrogametech Congrats Man! Ive Been Contemplating Starting A Complete Gamecube Collection.
retrogametech Its redonkulous! The last legit factory sealed copy of that game sold for 400 USD last year!! And just recently I watched a resealed copy sell on UK ebay for 250 as a Buy it Now! Absurd! Its of the worst games on the console! lol I have a bit of a soft spot for NGage. Got me back into gaming and one of the reason I started modding consoles. Probably the same reasons as you with VirtualBoy :P. Games were (mostly) cheap and not too many to hunt down.  love the obscure underdog systems!
retrogametech I almost bought one of those recently. The games and consoles are pretty cheap right now.
retrogametech oh man, im sure youre aware the VB has the same problem.. the 4 most rare  expensive games on the system are all complete turds.. one is on US ebay right now for 1799 dollars!! but yea, i like the underdog systems.. dreamcasts, saturns, VBs, original xbox.. theres just somethin alluring about collecting for the lesser loved machines.
retrogametech Funny, I have millions of those thumb sticks. I ordered a pair on ebay for 2, and ended up with 50 pairs.
retrogametech What happens if you put a large rumble motor in both handles? Does it work? Ive always wondered why one is small.
retrogametech Yeah the 360s Dpad is its only weakness IMO. Hope they sort it out for the next gen :)
retrogametech Where did you get that remote? I know that they sold the limited edition Halo 4 Xbox 360s here in the US. I bought the Gears of War 3 limited edition Xbox 360 which came with the same type of remote but with different art work.
retrogametech Easy mod to do. I might have to do that for my sticks.
retrogametech Nice stuff, I didnt know the controller was transparent, quickly looking at it you dont notice. Great video as always man!
retrogametech Jiggle Physics XD LMFAO!! loved that part. really cool to see a vid in this style here Martin. Feels like being in the same room watching this go on. DOA2 is a classic on the dc for sure. haha, the tengu boss is quite difficult (literally 10 seconds later) well, that wasnt too difficult haha. you crack me up man. enjoyable video as always.
retrogametech nice vid Martin! Do you know the differences beteween the LE version of DOA2 (japan) and the regular version? I remember when it came out there were all sorts of rumors (naked Kasumi alpha) but I dont think it was ever clarified online. Ive owned the regular japan import (DC) as well as the PS2 hardcore version. I think my fave is the xbox ultimate version.
retrogametech Thanks, man. I appreciate that :)
retrogametech The original DoA on PS1 and Saturn still hold up really well too. The whole series is very good IMO.
retrogametech I know, Ive got all the versions :P. Im a DoA freak, lol
retrogametech What can you do if a gal jumps up and wraps her legs around your neck?(lose) everytime!haha..great review martin,thanks for a look at this . What resolution are you playing on? couldnt see the scan lines on the video where they bad?
retrogametech Thanks for watching :) . Alpha152 and the cheapness of the AI in DoA4 totally ruined that game for me :( . The worst part was there isnt even an easy mode in the options. DoA5 is much better though :)
retrogametech I was a little surprised myself :P . I played it again the next day and it took several attempts just to get past the second to last character. Just luck I suppose :) .
retrogametech you are driving in the town i live in. cool!
retrogametech Always great to see these driving videos. Your dash cam rig seems to work very well indeed :)
retrogametech Lol, I never knew thats where the sample was taken from! They have some great tracks. I wish theyd release a CD or something.
retrogametech Theyre pretty awesome! They have a very cool 80s synthdrum machine thing going on! :)
retrogametech Awesome video and great music man! I will definitely checkout Streets of 2043. I also love driving at night, but instead with some ambient or piano music, its just so relaxing...until you start road raging D:
retrogametech Was that Hamilton you were in by any chance? :O
retrogametech Thanks! Glad you liked it :)
retrogametech 1:46 cant you just replace the entire screen with a backlit one?
retrogametech Dot Matrix Gameboy :) Sorry for the slow response! lol
retrogametech As mentioned in the vid, its not possible to backlight a GBC.
retrogametech Hey bud. Can you tell me the voltage thats applied to this little guy? I would like to to install it into into a Turbo Express to replace its dead lamp.
retrogametech it wasnt that hard, yeah right this is impossible for me!
retrogametech Definitely worth doing if you prefer to play on the original hardware.
retrogametech Can something similar be done with a Color?
retrogametech I havent tested it but I would imagine it is between 45V
retrogametech Im assuming battery life takes a serious hit? Looks awesome though.
retrogametech There was a piece of homebrew that let you export and import your vmu files over the serial port or ethernet. Also let you reformat the VMU to use the extra 40 blocks of unused space.
retrogametech I didnt see the drop down with the Links, cheers for the heads up
retrogametech Have you improved battery life? Because my biggest complaint about the VMUs is that the battery is dead within 2 days. Id think this would have the battery drained in 2 minutes.
retrogametech Looks very clean and legit, awesome stuff!
retrogametech you can rgb mod any n64 so ive read
retrogametech i could do it, idk why you would want to but i could do it.
retrogametech you know what would be an excellent mod? something that gives the vmu some decent battery life.
retrogametech Hmmm... I wonder if this would work on an original GBA
retrogametech That was an amazing deal! Awesome find and awesome video.
retrogametech Its also worth noting you have the black NTSC game pad thats not the one that comes with the pal unit , pal ones are grey like the console the American console was black like your pad but I feel this looks much better
retrogametech always wanted one of these, i wish i had as much luck as you on ebay. love the repair vids keep them coming :)
retrogametech Just see you have a multi mega, i bought one from a car boot for 3. Couldnt hand over the money quick enough lol
retrogametech Martin, you should put ads on your videos, I feel bad watching them without giving you anything in return. Also the money generated from the ads could help let you buy more junk to repair which would in turn give us more videos :D:D:D like so he can see guys!
retrogametech Good video just wondering if you ever made a video for replacing a fuse in a nintendo ds lite with no power. thanks
retrogametech Loving these videos mate :)
retrogametech So thats what the PAL version of the TurboGrafx 16 looks like (I thought it would look like the PC Engine). Anyway great pickup RetroGameTech.
retrogametech oh that makes sense. Thanks for the reply. Folks starting out in collecting mvs should google the words gotwalls  mvs. This site has saved by butt many times.
retrogametech I have a complete Bare Knukles 3 copy (manual, coupons, posterguide, catalog and yours looks good for the most part (the artwork on the sticker looks a bit soft but Im pretty sure its just the video). Love your vids BTW, I normally find pick up vids boring but I really enjoy yours, keep em coming!
retrogametech Nicely spotted! haha. It seemed like the right thing to do :P
retrogametech That explains why people consolize MVS systems.
retrogametech RetroGameTech is my favorite
retrogametech That Warioware game looks so much fun!
retrogametech Awesome import games!
retrogametech What are the names of the tracks when you showed dead or alive?
retrogametech you are the coolest person i know
retrogametech they are not worth 50 they are worth at the max 20
retrogametech I seriously doubt it. They have tons of companies that are attempting to work on it. I doubt he would even know where to start. Besides that flash cart is 80 bucks. Not including shipping and such. Not worth it to even buy it yet.
retrogametech Yes you can flash these chips a number of times. They are the same sort of chips you get on a pc mainboard for the bios, and you can indeed flash those.
retrogametech Haha, I think thats probably where I got it. Well spotted!
retrogametech Just researching the stuff that interests me :P .Theres loads of info floating about the interwebs :)
retrogametech this works like the new Gateway 3ds flash cart
retrogametech Most excellent dude, nice work on this!
retrogametech Oh jesus I want a repro of Trip World. Very nice work man!
retrogametech Conkers Pocket Tales is a game Id very much love to get. Im a massive Rareware fan.
retrogametech I own an original game boy however the battery terminal coils are undone. How should I go about repairing the coils?
retrogametech Nice job! Love the videos! What do you use for cleaning the battery corrosion? I havent been able to find something that works well.
retrogametech Do you know how to repair a gameboy printer that doesnt print?
retrogametech Achievement unlocked: Fix a Gameboy Original
retrogametech Do you have a gameboy printer i would like to see it in video if you have one
retrogametech i realy learnt from this keepmaking them :)
retrogametech Theres no grime in the battery compartment because you switched them
retrogametech Ive recently run into my old gameboy and it seems to have the same corrosion issue this yours did. What did you use to get rid of the corrosionclean the battery port?
retrogametech Pretty much sugar and butter lmao...its a LOT better than it sounds, but I recommend not eating a whole lot of it in the one go lol
retrogametech I tried some bro and maaaan, that is some serious sugar. like eating pure sugar.
retrogametech interesting stuff man for sure. Ill try a bit of it later.
retrogametech Youre a nut Luke! (LMAO at the space invader at the end)
retrogametech This gift however is basically just a box of sugar though, Tablet is the most sickening of all here, pure tooth rot. Im guessing from your anti scottish vibe that your english, pretty sure of that, I wonder what would have been in the box had it been from an english contact? a jar of jellied eels perhaps? No one likes the English, they like the Scottish and the Irish. I personally like the Welsh but I dont think most Americans have heard of it unless they are a fan of Tom Jones
retrogametech He must work over at walmart or something, looks like the 30 layers of wrap on a dvd case
retrogametech irn bru, awesome drink :)
retrogametech MADE IT SCOTLAND FROM GIRDERS! As the old advert used to say. In fact, there is an old Irn Bru factory just up the street from me, whoever sent that to Luke is the man!
retrogametech Id love to see a reaction vid for the irn bru!!!!
retrogametech Opps, I forgot about our different locations :. Didnt notice the description. Another kick in the nuts for every adult Nintendo gamers.
retrogametech i have heard its because of german laws, nintendo of europe said they are looking into the laws more
retrogametech This move is just cementing Nintendos reputation that its consoles are baby toys.
retrogametech bit of a stupid idea of the restricting. thats what the parental controls are meant for
retrogametech lost faith in nintendo sad day
retrogametech and the children who stay up late? lol
retrogametech Exactly. Hey Nintendo  how many copies of MK1 vs MK2 did you sell on the SNES during the 16bit wars? Thought so.
retrogametech Is this some kind of a joke? Nintendo is still so backwards.
retrogametech i guess its based on whatever time that the server which the content actually resides on or is being streamed from has
retrogametech English and hes Scottish...
retrogametech THE DESCRIPTION SAID WAFFLES! I WANT WAFFLES! XD
retrogametech retrostansolo Turok......I phone keypad....lol
retrogametech Really goooooood video :) nice pick ups could you please check my channel and videos out thanks
retrogametech AGS 101 was relase in EUR, but very very limited
retrogametech a good version of turok evolution???? lol will have to get it haha(and something to play it on)
retrogametech In a previous job, I worked on the technical support line for Akklaim. Makes me realise how old Im getting when I see Turok in a retro game video!
retrogametech Some one needs to give this guy a tv show where he finds faulty gaming bargains on ebay then shows you how to fix them, i would watch that on 4OD
retrogametech Only issue with the HD graphics models are the rainbow branding thing, but the lack of TMSS makes up for that, also, a bit of little known info, the EXT port is literally a reversed controller port, the pinout is exactly the same, I suppose you could technically use it as one.
retrogametech just won an original japanese megadrive model 1 today! its great because all games will fit into the the megadrive physically. Im not just on the fence of modding this one to have the region switches ....its so pretty D what do you think?
retrogametech Whats the point in overclocking it? As far as I know it makes the games all sped up and weird.
retrogametech Oh right cool. Thanks :) Ill be sure to check out that video.
retrogametech Do you do mods for other people?
retrogametech Thats a great spot for an audio jack!
retrogametech However, there is a mod you can do to Later Model 1s and Model 2s that makes the audio quality even better than an original Model 1. So then you get the best of both worlds. I forgot exactly what it was called though...I think there was a diagram on how to do it on a forum somewhere. I think if you search Crystal Clear Genesis Mod, it should come up.
retrogametech I want my md2 overclocked, av mod, 5060 switch and language mod, but im useless at diy etc lol. Do you know anywhere that will do it cheaply  reliable? Interesting vid as usual mate.
retrogametech Finally! Someone who believes in Sega Aesthetics as much as i Do!
retrogametech Took me a second but lol.
retrogametech Any progress is good progress! Kenn6275 might be able to help you, he made my CMVS and its great!
retrogametech Cant wait to see how it turns out :D
retrogametech Im very excited for this. Have you done any more work?
retrogametech glad to see youre still working on it, thought you had abandoned it! should be pretty cool
retrogametech Why take the metal sheath off the controller ports? Id rather leave it on, to guide and protect the pins, and hide the sheath behind that piece of plastic.
retrogametech I think 12V is mostly only used by the sound circuitry on MVS boards. Ill be slightly modding this one to only require a 5V 2A adapter. There are so many types of arcade board with different hardware configurations and power requirements, a SuperGun needs to be super compatible. Using a powerful PC PSU with its full range of outout voltages is a good way of covering all your bases.
retrogametech Haha, dont jinx it! Thanks dude!
retrogametech Bit late for this project, but you can get minidin connectors that match the Megadrive model 2 sockets. Then you can use premade megadrive scart cables on future projects that dont have room for the full scart socket in the casing.
retrogametech hello, which japanese systems come with the special fan? is it all of them ? D
retrogametech Nicely done Martin! :)
retrogametech Thanks for that most usefull, just changed the gd rom drive on my dreamcast with
retrogametech Thanks. I appreciate the feedback. I might do a few more of these videos as I work on different console in future :)
retrogametech If theres any music that gets me pumped for tearing down electronics (or for anything, really), its After Burner music. Probably some of the greatest compositions of all time.
retrogametech yes orange for japanese and more red for north america
retrogametech What about cleaning the dreamcast? Is it possible to get it back to new, even if its faded like the Pal one you showed us?
retrogametech I did too! We have an ice maker, so I didnt have any ice trays.
retrogametech that sega rally game last one to sell on ebay went for 455USD
retrogametech Theyre pretty good. The Dpad is much looser though.
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech Its very annoying whatever the reason, especially frustrating as now I have 60Mb connection at VirginMedia. So I can easily steam HD content (720p at 2800kbps) on the BBC iPlayer, but at the same time Youtube will struggle with 360p : The problem seems pretty intermittent, I was trying to watch something there about 6.30pm and it was struggling. Pausing then flipping between quality settings sometimes gets the buffer bar moving, but the download speed is still very, very slow.
retrogametech Golden Axe on PS2 Sega Classic Collection ..... awful and a desecration to the coin op original imo
retrogametech I think it would be nice if you did a few more random waffels. Yes! Another tumor attached to the Mega Drive:) I have been really lucky with SEGA wireless controllers. Ha, I just bought that PS2 SEGA collection the other day too. I had to see Fantasy Zone on the PS2. Congratulations on completing your collection.
retrogametech Awesome stuff! Ill be doing another room tour soon! Ill leave it as a video responce to that video
retrogametech Thats funny, I was considering doing almost the exact same thing! I have two small bars of lead sitting in my parts box and I was wondering if theyd fit inside one of my controllers. Good Idea to use the coins!
retrogametech I Need help repairing mine Can you help me with mine cause i dont have those gameslot things
retrogametech Thank you for this tutorial. Also got had a broken socket on my 3ds and i just desoldered it. Id just like to warn people to take a lot of care removing the metal part since it has a lot of solder and it can get on contacts of the board. Almost killed my 3ds but luckily saved it :P
retrogametech Just picked up one of these with this exact problem for 56, good guide, thanks, I hope it helps when I get mine in the post.
retrogametech Thanks. Just search for faulty and whatever it is your looking for. Thats how I do it. :)
retrogametech love this type of vids , do somemore plz :)
retrogametech you know there is a easier way to solder the contacts. just run the solder over the pins and done in a sec. solder will not bridge pins and stick the to contact points only. find a video and link.
retrogametech Nice stuff! Interesting to see the 3DS being fixed in real time :)
retrogametech Is there anyway you van do a tutorial on replacing blown fuses in a DS? Thanks and great videos!
retrogametech Hey, please answer. What soldering iron do you use? I really need a new one.
retrogametech loads of great stuff there m8:)
retrogametech Loving the new set up as always! Awesome to see what consoles you have running in the console corner of the room.
retrogametech Do you plan on setting up any console with RGB? Its really worth the upgrade!
retrogametech Alright! Back again, Luke here. This whole time I thought you were saying Alright! Bakugan Luke here. ...sorry
retrogametech Im always curious to what the metal box (with the air holes in the side) to the left of the lcd tv is. Is it a Namco System 246?
retrogametech The 360s delta fan whine is haunting me :D I cant stand those deltas! I love how nidecs sound and the slim model fans. Really queit.
retrogametech Thanks! Ill check it out soon :)
retrogametech Cools martin ill tweet you a pic because i dont have time to do a vid but just wanted to thank you. You,gamestar 81, and the captain 8bit guys all inspired me to start collecting but a special thanks to u !! AWSOME VIDS KEEP EM COMIN PLEASE
retrogametech Whats a console if its not modified?
retrogametech Besides I might loose power, I only have a SNES now, on the floor, and a CMVS, also on the floor in a box. I show both individually anyway. I dont want to do that again until I fix this mess, that is unless in the next few days a car doesnt fly through the roof destroying anything. But its on my todo list )
retrogametech I use all these consoles regularly so theres no point hiding them away in storage. If anything wears out or breaks then Ill just fix or repair it. The ones in storage wouldnt be used very ofteneven so theres no point in having them out on display etc.
retrogametech I know you dont spend much on these consoles but a lot of work has been put in. Im useless with an iron tbh. The 60hz mods are out of my league. If I wanted a set up like this, Id have to throw enough cash down just to buy it outright from someone who was clever enough to do all the work for me haha I know what you mean about the early 3D games looking poor compared to clean sprites. Although I liked the PS1N64 era, I definitely felt that way about the early 3D games on the Mega Drive  SNES
retrogametech I pressed like before the video loaded.
retrogametech It still takes me 10 minutes to pull out a console, get the cables and connect them all up, so there is setup time. So a lot of the time I dont bother.
retrogametech Or a shitty car like a Hyundai!
retrogametech I Bought Two R4 Clones, They Have The Raised Bit Of I Recall. I Couldnt Find The Right Firmware For The Damn Things.
retrogametech Ah yes, but these are faulty memory cards, lol. You can find pretty much anything on ebay if you know what to search for. :P
retrogametech 2 videos in a day??? life  complete :D
retrogametech How much would you sell one of these for?
retrogametech do you answer to pms?
retrogametech A lot of people here have suggested the Wood firmware as a generic one that works on most. Maybe thatll work?
retrogametech The originals have black labels :)
retrogametech I never knew about this. Hopefully you can do something with them!
retrogametech When I was around 5 or 6 I went to Turkey and found a pirated Gameboy advance cart with this game on it, needless to say, I never played this one very much.
retrogametech Im glad you warned me about the sound, because I am wearing headphones. I just wish I had heeded your warning:( It actually looks decent, but that sound......
retrogametech My ears will be ringing for the rest of the day and I didnt even use headphones. The notes are correct, but somehow they made it really painful to listen.
retrogametech No, that music is AWESOME!
retrogametech dude run y r u walking your supposed 2 make sonic run
retrogametech I was genuinely scared when you said to take off the headphones.
retrogametech Damn this is terrible. I have three multi game pirate cart with no Sonic game. Guy must be on drugs or something when composed that music. I have 55in1 24 different games, 11in1 all different games and 70in1 60 different games and they are not bad and i like those carts. In those cart are a lot of puzzle and Japanese games.
retrogametech this game is horrible
retrogametech Very impressive for what is essentially a homebrew Sonic game for another console.
retrogametech Lol my old ds that completely broke before it snapped in half from one of my friends stepping on it the touch screen had a huge ring sratched into it about 1 millimeter deep from playing pokemon rangers
retrogametech Im only replacing the cart slot so no need to remove any of the screens :) . If I get time Ill try and record some of the process. Its not too complicated, though. Just snipdesolder the old one off and solder in the new one. Job done! :P
retrogametech Why is it when someone ahows awesome colours of GBA and DS I get really jealous! I do like my blue SP though. I got a 3DS XL never seen the normal one is it the same size as a DSlite?
retrogametech How much do you sell your NES for? Also I have a black DS with a broken hinge. It still works, are they easy to repair?
retrogametech Cheers, dude! Got most of it up and running, just waiting on a few parts. Will def need to get a game of Mario Kart when I find myself a copy! :)
retrogametech Whats the website that you use to order spare parts and offbrand replacement cases. I know youve mentioned it in previous videos but I cant seem to remember the website. Its based in China and starts with a D I believe. I would really appreciate a response. Excellent work on the videos and console repairs man. Keep it up.
retrogametech Ah ok cheers, I thought it might had to involve taking everything apart for some reason lol. Looking forward to the update :D.
retrogametech Hi Martin please please let me know when you sell the nes as I just broke mine. Whats your eBay name so I can find you and bid if you prefer thank you
retrogametech Haha, thats kinda cool. Have fun! :)
retrogametech Thats fricken cool bro.
retrogametech martian are the wires just splice together or is there any fuse issues ? was think of try the same for nintendos
retrogametech Thats genius! Well done.
retrogametech Can this 220V adapter run both NTSC MD and MegaCD at the same time?
retrogametech That whould be a Xecuter LCD screen. I want one myself.
retrogametech Thanks. The thing in the Master System card slot is the 3D adapter for the 3D glasses. Its basically a 3.5mm socket where you connect up your 3D LCD shutter glasses. I did a demo on it a few vids back if youre interested to see the Master System 3D in action :) .
retrogametech Werent some of those meant to take 10v instead?
retrogametech id you over use that adapter could blow with all 3 systems hooked to it
retrogametech My experteise of installing 12 volt components on nonmotorized vehicles such as headlights and car radios is what helped me understand how functional 12 volt systems can be even outside of vehicles. You should also check out my videos of how my bicycles use their 12 volt systems. I even went as far as putting cigarette lighter receptacles on my bikes since my frequent riding may want to involve recharging of cell phones, or use of electric car tire pumps in case air pressure goes low.
retrogametech Great stuff man, I glad to see you finally have a working one now. A mini cab would be neat, you can pick up some joysticks and buttons on eBay etc. Making a small version for the mvs exclusively would be cool or a 13 scale for any future jamma boards would rock as well
retrogametech Im interested in seeing what the new screensaver addition looks like for the jukebox player on the bios update. Would be cool to see when you have the time.
retrogametech Great stuff! Always look forward to updates! Keep up the hard work!
retrogametech Lol, this is the last board Im picking up for a while! :P
retrogametech How did this turn out in the end Martin? Looks great, I have just bought myself a MV1B today and would really appreciate if you could point me in the right direction of choosing a suitable PSU, supergunharness etc. (Already have Neo Geo stick and will be using CRT) Thanks man, Max
retrogametech most of your videos begin with So I Thought
retrogametech The MV1B can be modified to run on just 5v so you wouldnt need to build out the back of the system. After a minor mod, youd just need to install a power jack and get a 5v power adapter that supports 3A or so. There is a guide for the mod on the Jamma Nation X website. The only thing that requires 12v is the audio amplifier, which generally isnt needed on a consolized system.
retrogametech why the hell would anyone want to pirate that game in the first place...looks absolutely terrible lol
retrogametech I have a few pokemon hacks on GBA carts. Actually really fun and well made hacks and Im glad I got them.
retrogametech Haha, its just one of the reasons Ive never made it past the first level! And after making this vid it was stuck in my damn head all day!!!
retrogametech Check Ebay For Pokemon Chaos Black, A Bunch Of Other Bootlegs Will Probably Show Up In The Search As Well.
retrogametech What are they called? I love pirate games have you played super mario 4 on gbc?
retrogametech nice find man! how are you? :)
retrogametech There isnt even 4 or 5 lmao
retrogametech Its crazy! I have two pirated GBA games. Metroid Zero and Jackie Chan. Both dump no problem as do all my original games. Bootleggers bring out their own unique unlicensed games and they manage to secure their code better than Nintendo!! Amazing! XD
retrogametech my decoder box is faulty
retrogametech got to give it to ya mate you have some skill and patience for some footery stuff... wish i had that lol id grab a set of these n fix them but mines would end up out the winda
retrogametech hello all good dude could you solve a problem and his microphone screeching when I do a voice recording my version and the American and connect it to my pc with the usb cable that comes out of the decoder would help?
retrogametech Check the vid I uploaded just before this one :) . Got another faulty board to mess around with.
retrogametech Im going eBay hunting now, been after these for a while, i just havent got the the 150euro to spend, Sound video! :P
retrogametech I Got A Pair Of Rocketfish Off Ebay, Used 25 Shipped I Think. They Hurt My Ears After An Hour Or Two But They Do An Amazing Job Of Cancelling Out Noise And Theyre Wireless. Worth Every Dollar.
retrogametech Very nice video. Wish you luck in getting the board to work. Looks hard tinckering around, lol.
retrogametech The language looks like some form of Klingon hehe :D Good stuff Martin, looks like youre definitely getting it sorted out :) Seems like its resetting itself over and over...I read something about that a week or 2 ago but cant remember what it was about. Luke will probably know.
retrogametech Doesnt the game cartridge also have a battery? I remember capcoms Jamma B board (game cartridge) had a suicide battery and the rom would need to be reflashed when it dies. Just like old Nintendo games. Just sayen there might still be an issue with the game board.
retrogametech Lol, at first I was thinking it was another language (possibly Klingon :P) but after looking through the MVS manual it appears to be the regular English menu just with screwed up text. This mobo is pretty corroded so Im guessing theres a bad solder joint somewhere (probably a few!). My original board is in much nicer condition so I really wish I could get some signs of life from that. Plenty of spare parts now though I suppose! :)
retrogametech Its much cheaper and I enjoy the process of DIY. You can get some pcs front light panels for game boys in aliexpress I got some pcs,a 4LED front panel. White LED and I put in front of the game boy LCD. it works perfect. Probably,next time I would get some colorful front lights,like RGB? It should be much cool,isnt it? You can see my DIY Game boys below. Also, youll find more tips about the DIY process here.: aliexpress(dot)comstore406029
retrogametech Another good video. Also when with the update video on the neo geo mvs be coming?
retrogametech yea...probably right there, Ive replaced all my Pokemon games batteries with Duracell ones and the problem there is i have to tape them in place which is unreliable connection...
retrogametech You can use a similar mod for GBA. I have a copy of Pokmon Ruby that now has a flat battery and you can change them to get all the time of day events again.
retrogametech or put it in your gameboy and replace it in your gameboy if your on a pokemon game
retrogametech Nice tip dude! Awesome.
retrogametech You always think of something!
retrogametech hey can you do a video on how to do this? i have a few games that i want to try this mod on.
retrogametech while the gameboy is turned on?
retrogametech i have a see through case like that
retrogametech evrything is possible even in canada ,,,am in quebec city i do mod xbox since the beginin
retrogametech mine did that sometimes. found a way to kinda fix it is to hold it when it goes back in. the gear inside is just a little off and can be adjusted easy.
retrogametech Hey Martin, that protect switch is for so you wont accidently flash your X3 chip. Great find dude. Im suprised how it end up on ebay due to ebay rulez with anything with modding. Ebay is very strict
retrogametech WoW what a great deal! good work
retrogametech Heya, I have the same model but its the original black box all in perfect working order. I am moving house and need to sell it so would you be interested or know someone who is? Thanks Jon
retrogametech sweet, so you could use a usb snes or nes controller with emulators? has anyone tried that?
retrogametech what are the usbs under the lcd screen for?
retrogametech Yeah, loads :P . I think theres a few vids on my channel where I havent been able to get things working again. A PS3 springs to mind...
retrogametech Doesnt the power supply need a load on it to turn on?
retrogametech So, even if you have bad ram chips you should get a warning on the system telling you this. I told Thomas the same thing, Ill make a quick vid for you guys showing you what I mean as I have one suffering from the same problems. The original bios wont allow you to change jack and it will not tell you whats going wrong except the cross hatch screen color pallet
retrogametech I also noticed youve got a socket there with no chip in it  presumably a missing BIOS?
retrogametech o nevermind lol.. i guess i shoudlve waited ten seconds
retrogametech Thankfully I think the MVS boards are just a single layer with traces on either side. Its still challenging enough though! :P
retrogametech I have one of the mini genesis version which is with its jap book called 16bit review its 2 carts one is virtua figher and other is comix zone.
retrogametech Haha, or a little red plastic cover :P
retrogametech It would be so cool if it worked!
retrogametech Thes are really cool collection of mini sega genesis, i know thes are rare tho, good find.
retrogametech And now to connect it to a tiny TV.
retrogametech So what games does it play?
retrogametech I nerdgasmed when I saw this :)
retrogametech What are you talking about? I was happy to see them fitted together, and Im not even on the same continent.
retrogametech Thats just awesome. So hows the faulty MVS going?
retrogametech Just solder a wire from the start pad to the end of the track, in case the connection is no longer made on the board.
retrogametech I hope it goes well! Im going to pick up my first MVS today after work, hoping to be able to fix it to :)!
retrogametech this is so rad! i cant wait to see the finished product! heres hoping there arent any more hiccups... and if they do happen to show up, you learn tons from straightening it out.
retrogametech No worries dude! Ive already wired in an extra ground for it so will probably just throw a switch on there anyway. At least that way for future projects Ill not need to worry about it. All my power wiring is now done so Im going to attempt the Scart connections tonight. Thanks again for all the help so far!
retrogametech OH WOW!!! :D Dude, I havent seen these things in YEARS!!! I got those when I was a kid...and I LOVED them! By todays standards, the 3D is a bit dated...but back in the day, they were ABSOLUTELY amazing! My favorites were OutRun 3D, Blade Eagle 3D  my ULTIMATE FAVORITE : Yep...MISSILE DEFENSE 3D!! ) That game was SO DAMN COOL...and sometimes Ill be driving home late at night  Ill get that freakin theme song stuck in my head! Haha! ) True Story!
retrogametech sweet ill have to try this!
retrogametech The Japanese Master System is awesome! Built in 3D output, FM sound and fancy BIOS screen! WANT! :P
retrogametech Very good review to get a replacementWhy people give dislikes on a helpful video???
retrogametech So this works on all versions of the Sega Master System? Because Ive never seen a card input port on SMS2 and SMS3 models.
retrogametech Lol, Eddie Izzard is awesome!
retrogametech just an idea but how about printing the ngage cover of tombraider on projection paper ive printrd color presentations on that stuff and it looks cool really colorful stuff and hardly any detail is lost
retrogametech If you have some chicken wire you can probably feed it through the holes in the back plate and use that to secure the lamps.
retrogametech nice job. pic frame would have been cool tho
retrogametech Haha put a raspberry pi in it P
retrogametech What brand of micro sd to mini sd adapter did you in the video? I hear some adapter are flaky.
retrogametech Where did you get it from?
retrogametech does it work in the gameboy player for gameube
retrogametech Im guessing that you can get the ROMs off website like CoolROMs?
retrogametech any one have a source to buy these for gb
retrogametech I had an old Flashcart once. To put games on it you had to put the cart into a huge converter, plug it into the PC and use FTP to transfer games xD!
retrogametech Also, there are many emulators for the card.
GameSack Cant wait to meet you guys!
GameSack Id go if you release a DVD lol oh and if I didnt live in Canada.
GameSack Its a bummer I wont be there..... You considering Portland next year?
GameSack You guys are great I hope you have a big time
GameSack I hope to go and see you guys since I have family in Dallas If schoolwork permit!
GameSack I wish I could meet you guys, but I live in Europe, so thats not going to happen :(
GameSack Theres a retrocon in Texas!? Count me in. Colorado retro gamers, lets do this instead of stupid NDK.
GameSack Awesome! Cant wait to see you guys there.
GameSack Great episode guys, bit of cheat using the CDZ as for a long time that wasnt the authentic Neo CD experience, and no Neo CD episode should be complete without the juggling monkey )
GameSack Fantastic episode as always, guys. I used to have the first top loader, but it kept resetting and going back to the CD player screen at random times. Was lucky enough to find an AES with a multi cart a few years ago, and never looked back. Does the CDZ have less of a failure rate?
GameSack No no thank you for another great episode
GameSack Great episode and great console. I also suggest Shinsetsu Samurai Supirittsu: Bushid Retsuden, or also know has Samurai Shodown RPG. Really good RPG overall, but with a lot of loading time.
GameSack stilllll wont be buying one. but, its nice to see it in action.
GameSack The neo geo cd has a reset just hold the four buttons and select.
GameSack That slap at the end sounded like it hurt
GameSack they should have picked another name than game sack :P
GameSack Golden axe shirt rocks. Arent you a Nintendo fan or did you have a change of heart in an episode I havent seen yet ?
GameSack Even though the cd is cheaper, is funny that the music is better in some games.
GameSack Broadcast quality show here!
GameSack Great episode as always.
GameSack Why would you rip video game music? I cant see the point. Seems a waste of time.
GameSack dude...the guy on the left is like a weird hybrid of ron perlman and jim gaffigan loloh you...you irishbad ass video nonetheless, dat golden axe shirt!
GameSack Japan is so damn weird. I love it though.
GameSack Magical Popn and Tempo 2 looked so awesome
GameSack Japan is so weird... I love it
GameSack I recently started rebuilding my game collection, do you have any recommendations where I can find games? I have bought a couple on eBay but I pay premium prices for what Im looking for.
GameSack Great episode as always, I have played all of these games. JK ), I have played about 5 of them total I think. Magical Popn is definitely my favorite from this list, epic game.
GameSack Magical Taruruutokun (Mega Drive) :), Thanks for all the vids
GameSack Yes make another left in japan series. You guys rock! I appreciate your style of reviews but I wonder if you curse in real life lol
GameSack Can anyone tell me what kind of TV they have? I know its a Toshiba but thats about it.
GameSack I think it would be interesting if you did an episode on how you set up your consoles for the best video quality. You could include modifications youve made to them along with tips and tricks as you guys seem to know a lot on the hardware side of things.
GameSack crafting was confirmed NOT to be in the game. The GDC presentation confirmed this and Deej only talks about the level customization based on the variety of gear THEY developed
GameSack Meant his 2nd possession with the ball!
GameSack Make more nba2k14 myteam plaese
GameSack Mut  MyTeam are full of quitters and btches man like does anyone play a game through does anyone not try and cheese the whole game
GameSack The silly as fuck sound effects are the icing on the cake.
GameSack Joe your sexual fantasies with consoles are creative and scary at the same time,... by the way you missed the part when the snes got rape to dead by the ps1, and the same thing with the nintendo 64 and game cube by the ps1 and ps2..., damn nintendo got gang raped too bad by sony... thats got to hurt
GameSack What the Frak did I just Waist 1:21 mins of my life on : Funny but still :
GameSack mat2000100 The Playstation was originally going to be a SNES add on. So it kinda makes sense (like putting the Genesis and the Sega CD making out )
GameSack THANKS,me and my PS2 were looking for some console on console soft action! could you do a hardcore one? or even maybe human on console? thnx
GameSack You guys are dorks. I love it.
GameSack Never though I would see an SNES and PS1 doing the nasty LOL!
GameSack I have the strangest boner...
GameSack Dat ending, some hot action going on
GameSack if the ps1 is not working right, You dont have to turn the ps1 upside down because thats not necessary you can turn it around on either the left side or right side also have something to hold your ps1 so it wont fall and it works perfectly on my fat ps1 just to make it easier and wont have a hard time changing the disc.
GameSack Oh my god! The credits! Its the manta tech demo from the Demo One disc that came with the console! Ah, the memories...
GameSack The hell did I just watch at the end? lol. Great video and Im definitely subscribing.
GameSack i did not know that ghost in the shell had a game for the ps1!! WTF I LOVE THAT SHOW
GameSack Great video, the ...dumbasses was brilliant.
GameSack Threads of fate, parasite eve, legend of legaia, jade cocoon were some of best games at the time
GameSack Jade cacoons a hidden gem!
GameSack have you done a Turbo Graphics 16?
GameSack Goldschwert  holzschwertGoldausrstung  lederausrstung
GameSack I loved Chibi Robo and its sequels and cant think you got very far. Did you spend all of your cleaning? Thats like going into Zelda and spending all of your time cutting grass. Besides if Skip Ltd. has a mascot at all, its Chibi Robo. Heres hoping Chibi Robo 3 gets localized. It wont happen, but I can dream.
GameSack WHY wasnt ristar here
GameSack Aero the Acrobat is one failed mascot you missed that comes to mind, but there are just so many of them that it would probably take you guys at least 4 videos to cover them all.
GameSack Chibi robo was more than just a cleaning sim cleaning was just an incentive to get money, the 4inch tall robot helped a marriage from falling apart, help a little girl cope with fighting dysfunctional parents,reunited friends, enkindled interesting romances, contacted aliens, discovered a unique source of power, traveled through time not to mention it had the quirkiness of story straight out of the Mother series. Them the music: the background music blended in with fact that all the actions chibi did had unique musical sound effects from moving from the different surfaces to the different tools chibi used.... all that and you seriously called it boring ?!?
GameSack vectorman was awesome
GameSack The only one I was actually expecting to see in this wasnt here which was surprising... Spyro the Dragon lol
GameSack And yet we still have people saying which games they forgot.
GameSack Cant believe Ive never heard of Socket. I want.
GameSack more more more more :)
GameSack Lmao! Awesome episode and congrats on your 100th!! Ive been a long time subscriber and its amazing you guys have done all this work. As an old school gamer at heart, I really appreciate all the thought put into each episodes. You guys are up there with the likes of AVGN!! Dont stop, keep making episodes till cellphones and tablets take over console and handheld gaming! Lol, thatll never happen. Having your hands n fingers all up on the screen is just stupid...
GameSack Milestone episode! Congrats on 100 episodes guys. Considering the amount of content per episode, that is monumental. Really enjoyed the unique choices. Heres to many more episodes of Game Sack!
GameSack Riley  Appearing in Revenge of Shinobi several years before his appearance in Call of Duty: Ghosts.
GameSack sometime i feel like u use my itunes for the music LOL
GameSack A lot of games that would have been in my list. I would have had Sonic 2 in the list mainly because it was the first game i ever played on my first console and Zelda: Link to the past would have been lower for myself as i have amazing memories playing that with family. Other than those personal details, great video and loved all the games you showed.
GameSack Hey guys, just wanted to say I really enjoy the show. Look forward to every episode. You guys are so underrated in my opinion. Love the length of the show too. It feel authentic enough to actually call a show. Loved the intro music, who does yall tunes? Do you guys make it yourselves?
GameSack Altered Beast guy! hahaha
GameSack No russian subtitles? Motherfuckers!
GameSack Like it guys,keep up the good work
GameSack I have a link to the past and mario world and super metroid on the WiiU VC
GameSack You can go into the options of Ranma 12 and set up for jump, but it should have been jump to begin with after all.
GameSack Hahahahahaha not musha ha!
GameSack You can dash on Dragon Ball Butoden with the trigger buttons. It was nice to see all these good old fighting games. Also you should try Yuyu Akusho on Genesis
GameSack I played so much World Heroes 2 on SNES. Its like Street Fighter II Champion, but with Mudman and a mode with obstacles and a seesaw life bar.
GameSack How about MMPR: Fighting Edition for the SNES, or MMPR for the Genesis?
GameSack Ive had Ive got musha, gonna play me some musha stuck in my head all day. Goddamnit dave!
GameSack I really like Budokai 2... haha. and you can dash with L and R.
GameSack You guys missed some hidden gems as King of the Monsters and Kidou Butodan G Gundam.
GameSack OH, and what those pseudowrestling arcade games?King of MonstersSaturday Night Slam MastersThem WWF jointsI know theyre not fighters per say, but maybe you can cover those types in an upcoming episode.
GameSack Best commentary of football that you have ever done lol
GameSack B Rap Boys... would have been nice to be able to bring home an 8 foot blonde dominatrix and her whip (dont judge me on that) home systems of the time couldnt have done the rap soundtrack (unless they were CD based, maybe)Battletoads looks exactly like an Amiga game on steroids, is it running on Amiga hardware? (Arcadia System)I actually remember Blood Bros, been looking for it for ages but could never remember the name, took up a lot of 10p pieces at the time!Boogie Wings looks like it would suit the PC Engine, though the PCE probably wouldnt be able to handle it.
GameSack 14:30  ok, but before I convince data east, I need to convince SEGA not to do a surprise US Saturn launch alienating developerspublishersretailers so data east will actually WANT to bring it to the Saturn for a stateside release.
GameSack Please review PROP CYCLE as it was AWESOME and was LEFT IN THE ARCADE!
GameSack Where do you get your arcade ROMs? I downloaded Osman, Wonder Momo, PsychoNics Oscar, and Willow, but when I tried to play them on MAME, it said that the games were missing one or more required ROM or CHD images.
GameSack Youve got that right... i was looking at Mystic Warriors and lusting for it...
GameSack For B.Rap Boys, you can press Tab in MAME and go to the DIP switch menu to set it to easy.
GameSack Nice job, guys. And would that be The 1up green screened behind you? Love that place!
GameSack What about segasonic the hedgehog
GameSack That Battle toads looks amazing! Thanks for putting that on my radar.
GameSack Part 10 of Cook, Serve, Delicious!
GameSack Thanks for showcasing them! some great gametypes were added!
GameSack I understand your 2v2 series get me in there. BTW HuskyRaidforlife
GameSack 2V2? can you pleeease kick some butt here? :D http:halocustoms.comthreads2v2tournamentsignups.14950
GameSack I cant belive the last comment of this video is mine! amaizing!  its from a very popular internet series :D
GameSack SharpX68000 master race
GameSack 16.02  16.58 : You are just being hilariously sarcastic in terms of gameplay and the use of double entendre, right?
GameSack Dont get me wrong, I enjoyed it I just going to sit down that long. Thanks for all you do!
GameSack I learned more on this channel than in school. I know you guys mostly do retro game reviews, but I was wondering what your opinions are on the next generation systems that recently released.
GameSack Sorry, sorry. Ive been watching all videos and i felt like the bald dude was VERY familliar. Isnt he HANDSOME TOM? Or very similar to him.
GameSack You stole his copy of snatcher?!?! For shame Dave!
GameSack MORE... MORE... MOOOOOREEE...
GameSack LOL at the end skit. Another great video fellas!
GameSack That Jim Power game is giving me motion sickness
GameSack 2:43 inspired meatwad? lol
GameSack Woah, instant 3D with one eye shaded...
GameSack LMAO  nuts on your chin
GameSack Mr gimmick for the nes?
GameSack Dont know if its been mentioned  but the Mr.Nutz prototype on the Megadrive was actually a port of the original Amiga version that came out previously.The released SNES and Megadrive versions that managed to get into the shops were vastly different!
GameSack Starcon aka star control 4 part 2 was epic 3 was a disaster and I have no idea why they cancelled 4 maybe it was another disaster
GameSack Fugazi shirt????? SICK
GameSack Mr. Bloopy? Booooooooooo!
GameSack Had Dreamcast made Toe Jam  Earl and Half Life Sega would probably still be around today.
GameSack Mmmmmm new comment on old video I like
GameSack Friend me on xbox gamer tag MadePuppy1
GameSack Yay im only 3 levels behind Sohinki
GameSack What gta are you playing 4 or 5?
GameSack I want you to play freeroam on multiplayer not this it sucks

GameSack yaaayyy lasercorns back on gts!!! :P
GameSack Did u guys find the imponte Phoenix?
GameSack Why do people make such a big deal about Sonic 3  Knuckles?!
GameSack Well... at least the SNES now is capable of BLAST PROCESSING :
GameSack Laughed so hard when I saw the tower of power! hahaha
GameSack I watched so many RDP reviews during the past few weeks but Game Sacks review is the definite one to go for, for anyways whos really interested in purchasing the system andor a good laugh.
GameSack The NES games have the most issues because Nintendo didnt tell the developers what each pin is for, so sometimes games were developed slightly different (e.g. a different pin for the start button).Also, do you guys plan on reviewing the RetroN 5 later this month? It is suppose to fix the problem with playing on HD tvs.
GameSack and youre absolutely right, Dave! For some strange reason these retro duo  retroGen handhelds CANT DO MOVES ON STREET FIGHTER!!! Trust me Dave isnt being a fool. The moves just dont register! Yet Sub Zeros freeze works fine!. Dont buy this crap! .... sorry. I just really hate these products, lol
GameSack So are they ever going to make better portables like this and mass produce them like so? I would love to make one for myself but i need more funds and what not
GameSack To be honest, if you have a PSP, you can emulate all these games on that
GameSack Pretty amazing handheld! But the only reason to have a GBA adapter is to play GBA on your SNES... The Game Boy Player is still a better option though...
GameSack joes awsome hes not a looser
GameSack Fun fact. I recently found out, if you run the Titan Overdrive demo on an emulator, it says Your Emulator Sucks
GameSack Huh, that Timmy game looks a lot like some of the stuff from I wanna be the guy
GameSack sadly touhou was not created that time
GameSack Anyone else notice that the robot voice in Insanity sounds exactly like CATS from those old All Your Base vids?
GameSack so cool guys you should definitely make more of these episodes I recommend the dreamcast for homebrew as it has a thriving community and plenty of awesome games made by that community.
GameSack I didnt expect to see touhou ( I may be spelling that wrong)
GameSack The Everdrives say For Chriminal Use Only!
GameSack Darn! Ive missed Beggar Prince and Brave Battle Saga for the Genesis. Still again a fabulous Gamesack episode, guys!!
GameSack Mario Odissey has Jarres music in the title...sweet.
GameSack lol u should play eye pets and friends o.o xD its to cuteunless u cant handle it that is
GameSack game for kids but still graphic is awsome in all playstation exclusive games
GameSack You should play more PS4 games. :)
GameSack smosh games nice joke guys
GameSack That is some next gen shit!
GameSack whats the lucas thing from?
GameSack Damn, that looks like Santa Claus was dismembered and squashed into a leather bag. I LOVE IT, lol.
GameSack D I wanted a christmas tree totem effect
GameSack nop, 21:27 is futbol for everybody except USA, remember america is a continent no a country.
GameSack Bill Lambiers Combat Basketball is a game I used to find fun, once you get past slightly stiff controls and a little learning curve.NBA Street and NHL Hitz (I have mine on GC) are another two sports series that deffo do not take themselves seriously.
GameSack Dammit Gamesack! Im trying to study for finals! Last one, I swear!
GameSack Hey guys, you forgot Sony Move Sports Champions Bowling, or any other bowler! Bowling is a sport, right? And volleyball, how about RealSports Volleyball on Atari VCS?
GameSack Really liked this video. As an european my only complaint is the lack of footballsoccer games.
GameSack Gotta love coming across someone at a flea market selling sports titles for just as much as the good titles. Its Rare!. No kidding, then Goodwill must have a treasure trove of rare titles on their store shelves.
GameSack did you have to pay the WR to recieve your love?
GameSack You oughta try the version of Tecmo Super Bowl on the NES. Its that same charm of the original that you like, with a slightly (and I do stress slightly) upgraded feel to it. Case in point, theres a reason people are still updating the rosters on that game to this day!
GameSack Have you guys had any bogus copyright claims on a bunch of your videos yet? Apparently its Youtubes big F U to all content creators just in time for the holidays.
GameSack The best sports game is NBA 2k14
GameSack YES YOU WENT WITH IMPERIALS :)
GameSack Least itll show skill rather than people who have Dragon Rulers and win.
GameSack Implying yugioh requires skill.
GameSack And us in Europe are like should we care. Then we realize that we are all net deckers of you Americans so cry.
GameSack I think its a bad idea they should just make the draft a side event.
GameSack Your description of Draft Format is incorrect.
GameSack So YCS is now luck based...
GameSack konami is so asian. this was an asian thing to do
GameSack Chazz Princeton approves of this
GameSack I laught at people complaining about the fact they spend a lot of money on their decks and dont even play with them. They dont even notice that the entire day 1 and half of day 2 they are going to play with their deck. But the most ridicolus fact is that the people complaining are avarage players who will never go in top 16.
GameSack You got in touch with a game dev? Interesting. Anyway, there are plenty of games that are better than the original at least in comparison to the ratio in order media. Take for example Harvest Moon to Harvest Moon 64: Great game to best game in the series.
GameSack Devil May Cry 3, We Love Katamari, and Streets of Rage 2 should have been on here.
GameSack I think Link to the Past did a marginally better job than Zelda 2....
GameSack i just noticed how many videos you have. and god damn you guys are awesome.
GameSack also my favorite pinball video game is pinbot.
GameSack Legendary axe (1) seems very similar to Astyanax from a lookandfeel and mechanic perspective.
GameSack Punchout was a great game, but I think super punchout for snes was a much better sequel.
GameSack I felt Grandia II was better than Grandia 1.
GameSack hey the miamoto in that picture was wearing a sega saturn shirt
GameSack Joe Redifers famous fisheye lens.
GameSack I thought I had seen this video before... On your oldpersonal channel linked from your site :)Very nicely put together.Little known fact... The Neo Geo can also play PS5 and Dreamcast 2 games :D
GameSack The console has kinda dumb hardware, why do you gotta use sprites for backgrounds?
GameSack I always wanted a Neo Geo. But it was (well, it still is) expensive as hell, and i had to play these games in the arcades. Oh, memories... How much would cost now, to buy a Neo Geo with KoF98, The Last Blade 2 and Real Bout 2? Probably more than a thousand bucks, right?
GameSack the flow of editing with the music was great and i loved the little sound effects that were used great little video!
GameSack Can you play turbo grafx 16 games on the Neo Geo?! Please reply to me with a confirmation, lols
GameSack diddnt really care for magician lord. My personal favorite was Sengoku. The most ate up trippy video game ever made.
GameSack god damn.... those carts were fuckin huge
GameSack All of the Rocket Knight Adventures sequels were just heartbreaking honestly.
GameSack Well, if you count gameboy Zelda games as their own thing, Id say Oracle of Seasons, but thats just me.
GameSack I loved the extreme games, I remember one you could put in a cheatcode and race as an alien on rollerblades
GameSack I never understood the negativity directed at Zelda II. In retrospect, its easy to say its the black swan of the series, but the developers did try out new things in the sequel which is rare these days. The game was much more difficult which is good and bad, and I thought the RPG elements worked wonderfully. I think the music is the best of the series as well. You make good points though and I think it will undoubtedly remain a polarizing title for Zelda fans.
GameSack Great fob, as always, but Ill disagree with you guys for the first time, about Sparkster. I like it better than the original. :)
GameSack How was Panic on Funkotron anywhere near disappointing? The first game was legitimately terrible, while the second one is at least of acceptable quality. Not sure how a step up is a bad thing.Being different shouldnt equate to being disappointing.
GameSack Paper Mario  Paper Mario TTYD  Super Paper Mario
GameSack Rayman raving rabbids
GameSack Rally Cross for the PSX was an awesome racer. One of my alltime favorites for the system. Then came Rally Cross 2. Not horrible but weak, very weak mainly due to the simplified suspension physics.

GameSack You missed also Prince of Persia
GameSack Controls in flash back were much better on the Amiga, I use to criticize the controls on most of the games on that machine because one button for everyting is what I consider to be a big fail, but in the case of games like Another World or Flashback, it is an advantage (in Flashback on the Amiga you press the spacebar key to use the gun).
GameSack Resident Evil on the Gamecube!
GameSack I love the Fugazi reference from the map on graph paper scene.  Thanks for playing Persona 4 Arena music!  Joe! If Dave took my copy of Dragon Force, I would have hadoken him through the wall!
GameSack River city random on GAMEBOY
GameSack tmnt reshelled was garbage
GameSack After seeing videos of the Dracula X remake, I knew I would be avoiding this game. Then I found out about the translated original game and SOTN included, and I was sold.Metroid Zero Mission was awesome, I agree there.For the next Remakes, there are all those versions of early Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games out there.Keep doing lookback videos like this, theyre educational.
GameSack For some reason, I never liked Super Mario AllStars. I dunno why, I think it might be the graphics on the SNES version, they just look kinda cheesy and I always preferred the NES sprites on those games.
GameSack EARTH WORM JIM XLA  PSN REALLY SUCKs BUT GENESIS SNES  SEGA CD ARE VERY GOOD
GameSack eine ansage wird nie gemacht, du nase )
GameSack Genau, die Aufnahme kam direkt danach. Sind aber zum Glck nur zwei Folgen ) Aber so etwas muss man als Chance begreifen... Vielleicht kann daraus ja etwas lustiges entstehen )
GameSack Hey, Dave  Joe, I ran a good search to see which version of D is best(because Im thinking of trying it out), and I read a comment from someone who said that D is an awful game, but that D2(yes, there is yet another game in the series) is actually a good game, so you might want to try that one out. It was released exclusively for the Dreamcast.
GameSack yes do EO cuz shes a hot blonde :)
GameSack for the next Halloween themed episode, play bioshock. I know daves not into first person shooters, but this one is great.
GameSack Love the episode, no shocker there. Who has the wicked sweet lake house complete with interior from 1978?
GameSack Uuuuhhh... isnt there a true sequel to D, called D2, on the Dreamcast? Also lold at the ending skit.
GameSack Must be a damn good lay, that could explain a certain other character whos known for being kidnapped ....
GameSack Sonic Doom Sonic Doom Sonic Doom Blood lust keeps him running faster Sonic Doom Sonic Doom Sonic Doom Killing Dave ends Game Sack  a disaster Sonic Doom Sonic Doom Sonic Doom Dont do that, you little bastar Sonic Doom Sonic Doom Sonic Doooooooooom
GameSack This Halloween Im definitely doing a games night. Ive got Splatterhouse for PS3 so thats definitely getting played but theres got to be a few more I can add in there.
GameSack Thats right, my bad, the Marty even though it looked like a game console it was more of a computer system, it even had a floppy drive and was backwardcompatible with FM Towns.
GameSack You guys should do a video with cinemassacre( angry video game nerd ). Like Pat The NES Punk did!
GameSack That was awesome! Keep up the good work.
GameSack Great use of stop motion animation guy!
GameSack Jill! I mean...Joe! Dont  open...that door!
GameSack Haha. Cool. I hope you guys are planning on a gamesack Halloween episode. I really look forward to those.
GameSack I love your videos, and I appreciate all of the hard work you put into them. Thank you for the hours of entertainment you have provided all of us. I am always pumped when I see you dudes put out a new video.
GameSack The show is seriously well done. I look forward to every new episode  keep up the great work!
GameSack Lol! You guys are awesome.
GameSack Id like to do Blurays but there are no Bluray authoring programs out there that can do the job I need to do (exporting in BDCMF or Sony CMF formats) that dont cost over 10,000. Adobe Encore is useless. DVDs would be tough because thered need to be so many discs. 4 episodes per disc MAX. We refuse to increase compression and the lower quality. I dont think its economically feasible.
GameSack you talk about mortal kombat like is any other crappy one off game for the system and like its any other fighter, when in reality it is one of the most successful and well known fighters, and one of the first games to use digitized sprites.I guess to me, when you say that you didnt really think mortal kombat was anything special, its would be like saying that Super Mario Bros. wasnt anything special.
GameSack lol  the Fifa comments. Its still that way today
GameSack I love your show! Thanks for making such great videos!
GameSack That warrior thing was on the3DO too
GameSack Nothing makes the virtual boy look good except some excedrin and the off switch.
GameSack Knuckles Chaotix and Tempo make this system worth it for me. Will be buying as soon as possible.
GameSack This is the 32xs 20th anniversary.
GameSack Try CDi version of Supreme Warrior!
GameSack Is the sega fanboy related to budo jake?
GameSack OMG! Cry Engine downloads slow!
GameSack It would be great if you could put a timecode in the discription so we can zapp through if we dont want to see a certain game. Great videos!GreetzEDIT:OMG! Unirally was fucking awesome in multiplayer :D
GameSack CTR! One of my favorite childhood games.March 17, 2014 9:52 pm
GameSack I wouldve liked Chakan to do something like that. It couldve been cool, like a competitor to Castlevania. Pulseman should also do that. Pulseman is amazing.
GameSack Ristar used to be segas mascot but when sonic got more popular he got replaced
GameSack Hey bro, the colors of the track in Uniracers let you know what is coming up next, be it a jump, hazard, open track, etc. That game is awesome and you are lazy.
GameSack 1:29 ....is that a penis ship?
GameSack I saw Ristar and I came running. Its probably my favorite Sega game period.
GameSack Uniracers combated the inability to look far ahead with the colour of the track.If the track was red and blue, it meant you shouldnt jump.green and blue go nuts, jump as much as possible.red and yellow  jump to go over obstacle or to land on another track.
GameSack CTR! D Greatest cart game Ive ever played.
GameSack Haha, I was just messing around. We have a joke at my store where we sometimes refer to link as The Green Zelda, and that this is like Mario only because its primarily a sidescrolling style action game. Just a bit of dumb humor. :)
GameSack Ahaha...yall a fool fa this
GameSack Thanks man true cant wait for the Monday night agains the bucs
GameSack Hey lewis whats your email....im your most favorite fan in the world.Oh yeah im getting the xbox one after christmas you shaould get one too so we can play online together thanks your awesome!P.S. im a guy
GameSack lewis add me on xbox live its Tyleruis Lamb i am a fan of u
GameSack cant stand by your own manager for half a season... pathetic
GameSack Gordan Strachan put it spot on , Theyve seen 20 plus years of glory the fans cant quit after a bad season but honestly Moyes isnt In Charge so to speak because he is a pushover , MUFC deserve a manager like Ancelotti or even Rogers who dont stand for disobedience and wont except a run of poor results from Shambollic players
GameSack As if people are saying to sack David Moyes already? Give him 2 seasons. This season to evaluate the squad and see what needs strengthening, then the next season is when we should be judging him, when he has his own team. Also noticed a lot of people saying about how teams like Chelsea, Man City, Real Madrid etc. are all doing well even though they changed their managers, they change their manager near enough every fucking season, so this season for them teams should be no different for them. We had the same manager for 26 years. Of course its going to take time for Moyes to settle in and build his own team, all about patience..
GameSack Sign this player sign that player. Any signing we make wont work with moyes get it to valencia to kick it at first defenders legs. Moyes change your philosphy.
GameSack If you want Moyes to go, go support Chelsea or City, you cant want him gone when hes only been here about 6 months. Hes playing the same players that won the league last season, so why is Moyes to blame for the players not playing to their best? It took fergie 6 years to win a trophy. Give Moyes time!!
GameSack They wont sack him this year im afraid.
GameSack Hes basically ripped the shreds and confidence out of Kagawa and Hernandez who are quality players. The kunt moyes keeps benching Januzaj, Hernandez, Kagawa, Giggs and Valencia and goes with carrick, cleverly, welbeck and young as much as he can. YOUNG IS A DISASTER Carrick is Mr Back Pass, Welbeck is nowhere as good as Hernandez as a finisher and Cleverly should be a rotation player at best.Fuck off Moyes just fuck off.
GameSack FFS we won the BPL less than 12 months ago and have been arguably the most successful team in world football for the last 1015 years. Every team has these phases and we r no different. Ours has just come after years and years of incredible success. SAF is one of the best managers to walk the earth and Moyes should have no pressure to b the next Alex Ferguson. We have been spoiled for a long time and need to stick by and support moyes as well as the entire team. Anyone who wants moyes sacked can go and support Cardiff
GameSack All you people saying sack him are plastics. Stay loyal and give him time.
GameSack 4 sacks in a row, loudest rammer jammer, and an overjoyed Nick Saban all in one video rolltide
GameSack I didnt realize an offensive line could be this...offensive... damn
GameSack He looks like a wounded animal.
GameSack As an Alabama student, our sack chantsong, the one you hear in the background is by far my favorite thing we do. More than Sweet Home Alabama and Dixieland Delight. I get chills hearing the entire stadium screaming YOU! after that short bit of music.
GameSack Shame on Les Miles for running a play on 4th and 28. Roll Tide!
GameSack This is pretty much what I imagine every Manziel scramble looking like once he gets to the NFL.
GameSack As much as I loved the win.. it was a great win.. but still work to do .. Take them one at a time . Auburn can have one of the Best seasons on the plains even better than 2010. If they stay focused and handle there business. 1 a time... WDE,,,
GameSack Appreciate your interest and dedication. I worked long and hard on this name. I hope to get much fame from the hard work I took into making up this completely great name. You think theyll name something after me?
GameSack Copy cat staff, they dont have a single creative idea and blindly copy all her ideas. This company obviously lack of talent and the boss sucks like hell
GameSack hahahahaha ini filmnya Juaraaaaaaaaaaaa... hahahahahahahahahah
