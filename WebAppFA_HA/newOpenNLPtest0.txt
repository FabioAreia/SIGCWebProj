TopGear it proble cost 345,0000 who would by it
TopGear i cant even afford an old murcielago...how i want to dream to get this one...huh...such a perfect daydream...
TopGear Cool, but 99,9 of people here wont even get close to dat car, so why bother. No point in arguing who prefers what car. It only makes you more frustrated.
TopGear Surprised nobody tried a fan boat style rig!
TopGear Doesnt feel like it but damn this episode is old o: look at Jeremys hair!!!! Its not completely grey!!!!!
TopGear bloody brilliant! Happy Birthday Jezza!
TopGear 5:49 come on you bitch lol
TopGear Toyota carboat.With Honda motor.
TopGear Im leaking.... too funny
TopGear Anybody know the composition that plays at 00:35?
TopGear Now the world is in trouble. Iran has learned Western naval secrets and has stolen the technology.
TopGear the sound of the old air cooled engines was mad
TopGear Its beautiful and its the perfect hard core car enthusiast kind of car but its way to expensive I think Id rather have a new GT3 and a pocket full of cash.
TopGear i have a porsche, its a 911 turbo
TopGear Why change a good thing?
TopGear but this car has a PDK gearbox, not a 7 speed manual...
TopGear Very nice !One thing though, if the dress is 50K for 2000 hours of work and the Singer 280K for 4000 hours, the dress is better value for money. So i guess James May has to go for the dress than xD
TopGear Did Captain Slow drifted...? :)
TopGear Since when did Captain Slow test fast cars?
TopGear Absolutely amazing! The Singer 911 is simply a work of art. One of the best things that could happen to a 911 is being done as a Singer. Great work Top Gear for uploading this video! Now please the Lamborghini Aventador Sesto Elemento next! Please! And keep the original music for gods sake.
TopGear that looks just like a holden
TopGear I like it better when its a Holden Monaro :)
TopGear That laugh at 3:33 ....
TopGear tanoshii  that sums it up nicely
TopGear The Vauxhall Monaro is simply a re badged Holden Monaro
TopGear hmmm looks like a Pontiac GTO
TopGear Did you see his face when he started drifting it? Pure concentration.
TopGear Pffft, i can do that!
TopGear Anche meglio grazie mille! Continua cos
TopGear so essentially its a grass cutting quad bike
TopGear Damn I was hoping for a crash
TopGear Dad: Dearest! Im gonna go mow the lauwn now. Be back in a few, okay?!Mum: Your doing what?!
TopGear use slick tires..might go faster
TopGear out of my way fools...gotta get to other end of my yard in under 1 sec D
TopGear what is the name of the driver?
TopGear If only it could be like a Chaparral 2J or those Gran Turismo Red Bull machines where the mowing blade is modified for fan suction (probably wouldnt cut grass or hold a bag for clippings).
TopGear any idea what was the time lap?
TopGear Chris cracks me uphes going fast as fuark in one of the most badass supercars of all time, and hes just talking to you like normal, even using his other hand for emphasis as hes explaining stuff like no big deal haha. Just in the passenger seat Id be scaredthrilled speechless!
TopGear That wouldve been fun! How did you guys hook this up? P1  So rare
TopGear It sounds like a nascar
TopGear I knew it! You were on the Top Gear track!
TopGear This is a track on Forza 4

TopGear Why isnt he listening hes so stupid !!!!! LOL
TopGear Just a normal day at the office...
TopGear Theyre getting better!
TopGear The Saab 95 Aero is an allround supercar for a bargain! It has all you want from a car and can last a lifetime! Try it out! I own one! Saab made sensational cars and develloped the turbo 4cylinder to the limit! R.I.P. SAAB!
TopGear Its the best car Ive ever driven...I wonder which one Jeremy would pick if you lined up all the cars he says that about.
TopGear Pretty slow compared to other super cars honestly.
TopGear Thanks for wasting my time
TopGear Under the hood never pops the hood. 3.1410
TopGear The last one! Gold gtr!
TopGear a video of an LFA with no sound of the actual car is a travesty
TopGear There is no way that thing goes 202mph. It only has what 500hp?
TopGear Lexus LFA  Under the HoodMany things are wrong with it, but its still the best car Ive ever driven... Jeremy Clarkson on the Lexus LFA. The V10 engine in a Lexus LFA revs from idle to the red line in just 0.6 of a second.Thats so fast, the engineers had to fit a digital revcounter because a conventional needle couldnt keep up.
TopGear 2:34 Thats the song JP was listening to in his office in Grandmas Boy haha.
TopGear I love Lamborghinis because it is soooo beautiful and I am Italian but mostly because it is beautiful.
TopGear This was easily one of the best tests they have ever done
TopGear this channel is like DAVE.
TopGear activate this channel moreupload more vids
TopGear I wonder when they are going to get their hands on a c7
TopGear ..So here I am!I died.

TopGear What is teenage stig doing in toilet and with doors closed??? And with a tablet! Is he racing something else? Some say...
TopGear Probably Daniil Kyvat
TopGear M JUST WANNA CAN DRVE LKE STG
TopGear All we know is, hes called the STIG! :P
TopGear The Stigs teenage cousin  Pig.
TopGear stig has swag ? the stig created swag.
TopGear La differenza tra noi e gli inglesi  tutta in questa puntata. Amen
TopGear lol so much post production in there that it ends up looking like an animation
TopGear without oil the earth can only support 2.5 billion people, fun fact.
TopGear You must be soft in the head for wanting to buy the faster car? I thought this was Top Gear?!
TopGear First ever electric super car was Rimac ConceptOne with 1000hp. Just so you know.
TopGear I like the sound of an engine... electric seems dont know.. boring...
TopGear Why not charging it while it goes? There are dynamocharged electric things, so why not making something like that? Wheels are constantly spinning, so here is the energy :)
TopGear Electric super car? Mercedes is mad
TopGear This thing shall gone dark when jit by EMP
TopGear surely mercedes made the petrol version slower on purpose. mercedes must be big on propaganda hype for the electric now. the fastest cars arent electric. as much of our electricity comes from burning fossil fuels and the fuel is transported using tanks running with petrol etc its not exactly any better. they really need to get those super charging batteries (few mins) ready soon.
TopGear Per caso riusciresti a caricare anche quelli delle stagioni precedenti alla 19?
TopGear la sesto elemento ragazzi  qualcosa che fa spruzzare da tutte le parti 3
TopGear Come se le inventano?? Sono dei grandi
TopGear This Aston Martin is damn sexy...like every Aston Martin xD
TopGear Wait a minute.... Didnt Aston also use a 6.0Litre V12 for the DB9 and the DBS and the Virage and the V12 Vantage and the old Vanquish? Dont tell me that the engine in the new Vanquish is the same basic one you got in the old Vanquish....
TopGear TOYOTA CELICA FULL BODYKIT MODDED SOUNDS AWESOME
TopGear This car does not have 517bhp... It has 565. Cmon Top Gear youre meant to know these things.
TopGear i had to watch a 30 second ad to watch a 41 second video... this is my life.
TopGear love this car so much :)
TopGear Minchia ma la spagna  messa peggio di noi!!
TopGear Also I like how the Lotus is a triumph of British engineering even though it has a Toyota engine.
TopGear What bugs me with top gear is that when it comes to American cars (particularly the mustang) they always seem to make it slightly unfair, for example using a older, lower powered, heavier mustang against a small lotus in a track race. If theyre using one of the best cars lotus has then they should have one of the best mustangs, the shelby
TopGear The Mustang is a heap, looks and drives like an old man. one of many embarrassments to the human race
TopGear so many butthurt Americans crying in the comments section.
TopGear what are u trying to prove when you race a lotus like this against a mustang?? what is the challenge?
TopGear They should have tested it against the Leguna Seca edition of the mustang.The Mustang is in a completley different category as the Lotus is, Mustang isnt designed for corners stock from the factory, the lotus however is. The Leguna Seca edition IS however...
TopGear 1:20 is that a concorde or something
TopGear The Mustang looks better , sounds better , its more luxury , its bigger , its just a better car. Get that stupid Lotus out of the track and when you find the first bump on the road youll destroy it , and youll pay twice the price of the car to repair it. Thats the truth , that little white thing is useless , and the only people that got Lotus cars are just fat british reach people that know that they are stupid cars ,but they want to say i have a british car ,and o love it!
TopGear the guys were in the highly secretive topgear planning facility thinking of ways to shit on american cars. then jeremy thought oh gee why dont we put up a very quick, extremely impractical, overpriced lotus up against a mustang GT! sounds totally fair right?
TopGear Subaru and Top Gear :p
TopGear Ahahaha,il baricentro di un bruco!
TopGear Add a message to your video
TopGear iscriviti al mio canale io mi iscrivo adesso sei troppo forte metti altri video
TopGear id rather have the jaguar

TopGear Funny how they discuss things and ended with...Ferrari..love it.
TopGear The big crash hit Spain Hard ! Those modern ghost cities are a Trip !! I want to move their ! I would never clean ! I would just move into a new house every week )
TopGear You guys need to announce when its the last episode of the series. Instead of my hopes being up the following Sunday.
TopGear So tomorrows episode will be the 2nd part of the special, and then therell be one more studio episode?
TopGear IS there anywhere where I can watch all of top gear? I miss every episode because I dont watch tv, I just wait until it gets on to netflix.
TopGear Did you have any side affects when you went into chrenobyl? What did it feel like?
TopGear How would Hammond know he wasnt in Chernobyl
TopGear Chemistry. This is why this top gear is amazing. The hosts have chemistry
TopGear When will you put more series on Netflix?
TopGear Oh serious just seven im in nz and we have only got to episode 4 or 5 stink
TopGear WHY MUST THIS SEASON END SO SOOON!!!!???

TopGear That looks like my gta 5 garage
TopGear She is amazing.I want her in my house :)
TopGear She doesnt own them but how in the hell did they possibly get a f40 they only made 200 of those. Most extensive car in the room 15 mill
TopGear Good Vid from a Top Gear Fan
TopGear subtitles in english anyone?
TopGear Quando la carichi la seconda parte??
TopGear yeah bitch!!! speed.. !
TopGear Casey Chamblin Yes we do pronounce the e in Porsche.
TopGear Good stuff. Go Aaron Paul. It is funny, that the producer is speaking in future tense, when ever these videos are published, after the show is broadcast. Lol.
TopGear Jesse get back to work!!!
TopGear Poor Stig. his life just became over, just like that. how awful.
TopGear Its Braking Badly...Bitch!
TopGear I did pretty well around the track guys...
TopGear Gray Ahem British TV show, British spelling please.
TopGear He can only move one direction. Lol
TopGear Whats up with the sportscars and spiders?
TopGear Looks fun to be 1 of them
TopGear Oh yeah mclaren WOOO :D
TopGear can you open it for me? James: NEIN  LOL
TopGear Noooo!!! The video ends before we can see Jeremys smug face
TopGear before I die I wanna an airport to my own and a supercar of my choice to have fun with, which is NEVER gonna happen. :(
TopGear Imagine if tilton were on slicks. For those that dont know they were on street legal tyres.
TopGear Top Gear 19x04 ITA HD Prima Parte
TopGear 9000x better than Subway Surfers
TopGear Some say.. He live only to speeding the track, all we know he is THE STIG!!LOVED STIG... 3
TopGear Still better than subway surfers
TopGear Oh boy, just what we needed, another temple run clone
TopGear The itself is awesome but way too many ads, I know its free but you dont have to have an ad every time you play
TopGear That is so cute. :D Teenage Stig with headphones. 3
TopGear I have the new Face lifted Hyundai Tucson CRDi 2014. and im so satisfied. just sharing nice job Hyundai.
TopGear Work harder. Get a car.
TopGear need for speed.....I hope the hell not
TopGear FLDQoftheD I think its either gonna be redinky dinkulously fun... or terrible. Either way Im looking forward to it :P I think they (the hollywood powers that be) will try and make it into a FF franchise (cash in on his new found stardom  also the whole racing game following) however because FF had a smaller budget originally and was sorta a cult film out of the blue (the first one of course) it had the right attitude (story possibilities  cast) to grow into a franchise. Obviously now its got massively more redinky dink than it already was. It depends whether Need for Speed allows enough storycharacter for a franchise, he cant keep getting out of prison and exacting revenge for 7 films...
TopGear Theres gonna be the New SuperVeyron in the near future. There is still another chance to get up in over 270 mph Commenter of the week.
TopGear it seems your doing a hard job to make this show, but whats your earning from this ?
TopGear Fast  Furious will NEVER, I repeat NEVER be replaced!
TopGear i hate when people compare the veyron to the stupid venom and the agerathe veyron is LUXURY and speedthe agera is as noisy as a tight blonde pornstar (good looking) but noisythe veyron is in a different league. you have to respect good engineering from all companies
TopGear The one:1 is one of the best engineered cars ever. How can you discredit that car?. 2.8 million is a lot. But that much has been put into it. The venom GT on comparison is just looks and feels tuner car. Even the door on a koenigsegg is more complicated than the entire venom GT. And i personally think its a good looking car.
TopGear Venom GT smells ollon.
TopGear Great episode, no bs, no bias, just the straight facts, why cant more car shows be like FLD? Great job guys, ohh and you did pretty good too Derek D...BITCH!
TopGear well... Clarkson said it as if he was proud. ahahahaha
TopGear So much lip smacking.
TopGear how many people were narrating the lap as the stig drove?
TopGear For the guys out here who dont know, the old stig used to be schumacher but now he is in a comma, so they got a little teenager as the stig.
TopGear more raw track footage please!
TopGear They should do a review of one of the latest Donkervoort Cars...theyre always complaining about the looks of an Caterham...Donki  Caterham gets beautiful...
TopGear did anyone els say AND ACROSS THE LINE to themselves lol..
TopGear Such a nice soundtrack
TopGear Love the sound of that little blue car.
TopGear I loved James film about the Caterhams.
TopGear They didnt put the S3 in S mode... Waiting for the new RS3 to be out!
TopGear I have a feeling Gav and Dan were involved.
TopGear this need music from deadmau5
TopGear 50 Evo fans disliked the video.
TopGear Im confused as to why there is a Subaru doing donuts while on fire..
TopGear What im wondering is, what colour is that subaruss front, i mean at start its blue and in the end its white
TopGear Top Gear live is worse than top gear us, because it directly removes the hosts from making top gear films :(
TopGear If only they toured in the US. I need to see this
TopGear These guys are super antielectric.
TopGear the lambo jumper scene looks nice, but i guess he just jumps infront of the lambo and not above
TopGear Stig be like go home your drunk
TopGear Richard hammond makes me feel wet and wild tbh
TopGear Is the stig wearing an antifog shield in his helmet?
TopGear terrible conditions for the tyres
TopGear Why cant all these countries just let it be in english, in the Netherlands we pretty much always let the audio stay its original language.
TopGear I think German and the normal UK Voice are the best ones
TopGear I usually dont like the dubbings here in Italy but when we talk about Top Gear...I LOVE IT. I cant decide if I love more the english (traditional) version or the italian one (specially when Jeremy talks!!)Love you guysCiao ciao :D
TopGear Great Britains version is the best! Every American knows that US version was a joke.
TopGear Respect From PAKISTAN
TopGear I am eternally thankful that they never tried to dub this in Hindi. shudder
TopGear Subtitles are the best option. I get to hear what they really say and no translation can beat that... :D
TopGear I think its important to underline factual :D im really glad german TV broadcaster stopped synchronise TG, and bringing the show with subtitles. Its actual much better in English.
TopGear ive seen this car at nordschleife,
TopGear Imagine a stretch limousine version of this car.
TopGear they should have a racing series for these.
TopGear 1:38 I laughed so hard !!
TopGear Lol I love Jeremys face haha
TopGear I.want.one., its so.beautiful! And the gtr my dream car!
TopGear you forgot russian translation :(
TopGear This with an keoneggseg engine
TopGear i had a honda commercial before this video.
TopGear i always watch Top Gear in english, at 1:06 i tought that language sounds so stupid...than i realised it was german, no wonder other countries make jokes bout our language.
TopGear I love the Spanish and Italian, just for sheer comedy. I also remember seeing Top Gear in German whilst on a school trip in Germany (and I only, vaguely speak French). That was interesting.
TopGear Hammond kind of sounds right in spanish. Jeremy sounds right in German and May in propah pucca English. Dont know if everyone will get what I mean
TopGear 1:20 Literally got left in the dust...Wow.
TopGear american voice sucks ,  it s like to hear a duck speaking ... the english voice is more soft but not better than a latin voice really soft . i prefer to watch top gear in french than the american voice of top gear .  the english brit top gear voice is better but not so good than you say it .
TopGear nothing better than english and omg spanish hahahhaa
TopGear English top gear and english accent language beats all!
TopGear Sound like Spain peoples no Mexicans
TopGear Worlds most watched factual show... ahem... factual... Top Gear is my favourite TV show of all time and its definitely the most entertaining, but I wouldnt call it factual LMAO.
TopGear Top Gear fans in Indonesia is very much, but why Top Gear dont have languange Indonesia?
TopGear AHAHAHA Hammond sounds so weird speaking in Spanish !
TopGear Jeremy has a certain way of describing things that is unlike any other host.
TopGear Anyone know what Season and Series this is from?
TopGear 6:12 well Im watching this on an iPad...
TopGear Id like to see him actually drive it on the public road XD
TopGear Its an F1 car that have the wheel arches
TopGear top gear in 4k anyone?
TopGear My god... I found my dream track car! So beautiful.

TopGear Christ a Brit will never pass up the opportunity to take a stab at the US just wedge an insult in there however they can..
TopGear well thes be on tv in aus ?
TopGear His name is Oisin Tymon! How does the channel mess up its own producers name!
TopGear Jeez, he knows, you know

TopGear Thor VS Loki please!!
TopGear search for Tom Hiddleston as Thor casting video
TopGear When I have to go to the UK, it takes me a week to get used to driving on the right side. And I seems to piss off everyone when I have to use any roundabouts.
TopGear In the description, they spelt his name Ton HiddlestonE. With an E. Theres no E
TopGear HAHAHAHA The Umbrella. Thats the summary of my humor. xD
TopGear what car is he driving?
TopGear He has such nice teeth.....  sigh
TopGear Yall should allow Top Gear world wide not only on stupid BBC which is watchable in the UK.
TopGear He didnt really fly around that track as well as he said he did. Its Loki... come on! He tricked us yet again.
TopGear I could have sworn It was blue 5:31.
TopGear To much BS in this one.
TopGear 90 mile beach is called 90 mile beach because its exactly 55 miles Im from New Zealand and I dont even know why its called 90 mile beach when its not even 90 miles long! xD
TopGear culdnt stop laughing when i saw james,s face when he saw the red car instead of blue one
TopGear where has that Serbian guy gone that called NZ boringI want to have more fun with Him

TopGear Wheres the road? Oh that will do. I was rolling when he said that.
TopGear Ma su discovery channel c la serie 20??
TopGear Is the Stig in there? Wouldnt be surprised, THE STIG IS IMMORTAL.
TopGear Epic. Insanely epic. Slightly useless, but still epic.
TopGear The best kind of 911, one on fire :)
TopGear I was at Top Gear Live in Amsterdam, but those Porsches werent really on fire. You could see some special parts placed on the roof and front, which caught fire, but didnt let them burn down so calm down Porsche fans...
TopGear ugh... the slow motion ruins everything about this illusion.
TopGear I think people need to get over their feelings over inanimate objects. : Dont get me wrong I love cars too, but I wouldnt get too caught up in emotions over a flaming car.
TopGear do the lights flash at that speed in slow motion?
TopGear neat watching the big TVs in the BG and noticing that they are stuttering from the lower frame rates compared to the slow mo camera!
TopGear And they are still exploding
TopGear Its like being into one of Jeremy clarksons dreams :p
TopGear Is this what heaven looks like?
TopGear Coming down the the first corner ..... BIG CAR SMASHES ....
TopGear To all the Dutch people that are going crazy about this: I like you Dutch guys but chill out about the cycling.
TopGear So it seems theyre the same all over the world.
TopGear More bad drivers than bad cyclists.
TopGear Any auto advert about the difference between 50cm and 1,5m?...
TopGear Had that happen to me yesterday, a cyclist who just drove out into the road, I had to slam on the breaks, and she had the nerve to say watch out, guess what... she had a red light.
TopGear Be safe. Take risks. In that order.
TopGear hahahaha nice one i stop when its red .. but not when the road is clear
TopGear Cyclist are really fucking stupid, they ride in the middle of the road thinking all cars will yield to them and they dont stop for traffic light. Fucking idiots
TopGear this is one of the greatest cameos ever 8D
TopGear Them pronouncing Heniz last name lol
TopGear Doofen....Disch.....Koenigseggsegegseeessgsgggsggs?
TopGear Yes, another reason to hate Lee Macks guts!
TopGear Auer dem Namen haben die beiden Sendungen mMn eigentlich nicht viele Parallelen. TG UK hat fr mich(!) unglaublich viel Charme. Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond und James May sind drei Charaktertypen, mit denen sich jeder irgendwie auch identifizieren kann. Ich finde es unglaublich unterhaltsam, wie die Drei mit smtlichen verfgbaren Klischees und Vorurteilen spielen. Egal ob sie sich dabei nun auf Personengruppen, Lnder oder Automarken beziehen. Klar, es geht der ein oder andere Witz etwas unter die Grtellinie, aber nach so etwas gieren die Zuschauer. Es bringt schlicht etwas Abwechslung in das sonst sehr weichgewaschene und sozial korrekte Fernsehprogram. Die deutsche Synchro ist allerdings Mist :)TG USA hingegen ist fr mich nur ein schlechter Abklatsch vom Original. Die Protagonisten sind schlicht langweilig und die Sendung dreht sich letztendlich nur um das Hochhalten der amerikanschen Flagge. Es gabgibt brigens noch TG Russia, South Korea und Australia. Sehr erfolgreich scheinen diese allerdings nicht (gewesen zu) sein.Auch in Deutschland hat man sich in der Vergangenheit um hnliche Formate bemht. Die meiner Meinung nach beste Umsetzung gab es mit DMotor. Leider wurde diese Sendung mittlerweile abgesetzt. Die drei Protagonisten hatten aber immerhin einen Gastauftritt bei TG UK in einer Sondersendung.
TopGear O que meu vdeo est fazendo ai sem as devidas fontes?
TopGear LOL! This is so hilarious!
TopGear Haha! Seems you thought as much of it as I did! Like I said in my letter there were only around 5 watches in the whole thing that I would actually wear. Its publications like these that make people think that a shit watch is actually a good watch. Guess Top Gear did ok out of the advertisement revenue though so dont really care!
TopGear From what Ive seen on the show Omega is a big sponsor,Ive the guys wear Bond SMP 300s,Railmaster XXL, Planet Ocean and Speedmaster in professional and Dark Side flavor, also Submariner.
TopGear I like top gear but that watch magazine was a joke...almost seems like TG needs some extra money to keep going because they obviously sold out to who ever would pay for ad space.
TopGear Was watching top gear right before this. While they know cars they have no fucking idea about watches.
TopGear Horrible watches in that magazine Arch, just horrible POS.
TopGear brilliant :) am gonna make a fresh coffee and zoot for this one :) top man craig !! see you at triplicity ? your on the guestlist )
GameSack cooles video , lade aber besser an einem Tag ein ganzes Spiel hoch wrde ich besser finden mfg Tyronix

TopGear Its because the copyright
TopGear Every top gear us they have the voices changed in not great
TopGear The funny thing about Richard Hammond rocking that ring beard is that he looks like Steve Pizzati, one of the Top Gear Australia Presenters
TopGear OMG, My sides hurt from laughing so hard. How can a grown man not know how to ride a Horse?....on a most basic level? Perhaps this is the definition of Metrosexual?....Human males so far removed from their past as to be so inept? Glue? Horses were moving man  materials thousands of years before the internal combustion engine was even invented!
TopGear now the stig will Tesco around our track,, some say ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TopGear Hello horse, I will call you Tesco
TopGear I couldnt stop laughing XD Hahahahahahhaha
TopGear Good thing theres only one horse power so the ride wont be bumpy.
TopGear May I use your restroom, my scrotum is on fire The woman probably thought he was asking to go in there and rub one out lmao
TopGear What episode is this?
TopGear i love when they still have tags on clothes
TopGear The boys REALLY need to invest in some serious protection for their gentleman sausages. They always seem to complain about their packages. I hate to see poor Richard loose his chance of having a son.
TopGear This was funnier when they were making the advert for the Scirocco.
TopGear They wanna make it safe?Like we have in HollandCyclepaths! SOLVED!!!
TopGear Act your age get a porsche
TopGear make cycling saver by driving a car instead lololol
TopGear So far...A second comment I have made :D
TopGear This has to be the funniest segment theyve done in a while. I so love this show!
TopGear that is so weird! i just saw for the first time the old movie bridge on river the kwai like last week
TopGear What happens?Do they fail... Or...
TopGear So Richard only hurt his wrist yes, nothing else?!?!?!?
TopGear Best show in the states

TopGear Stig has proved that the paddleshift buttons on an automatic vehicle are totally useless.
TopGear This guy almost burst my eardrums today when he set the track record. An Aussie hero!
TopGear Koenigsegg one:1 review please :)
TopGear episodes 6 and 7 are in Burma hence not a studio show
TopGear This car does NOT get 70mpg. It gets 30mpg after the battery is empty (any trip longer than 20 miles). Youd be betteroff buying a Prius or CRZ that get around 50mpg no matter how far you drive.
TopGear Why did you edit out the part where they went into chernobyl and jeremy ran out of petrol near the amusment park?
TopGear Ok, is it just me or didnt Richard, James,  Jeremy go through Syria just before there civil war? Now Ukraine and Russia takes Crimea? I think Putin may be a producer on TopGearconspiracytheory
TopGear Am I the only one that wants to listen to Jamess lectures?
TopGear Captain slow had the right idea.... get the computer to switch into limp home mode... all injectors start injecting fuel all the time, no switching... very clever
TopGear F1JunGT they arent trying to save gas theyre trying to use it all. Did you even watch?
TopGear LIES. Its all setup and scripted. I would love to see what would happen to three regular guys on this kind of road trip, instead I have to watch something which has been scripted back in an office in London then badly acted and trying to pass it off as real and spontaneous but its such obvious lieing BS.
TopGear That radiation detector was WAY to sensitive....

TopGear All I can say is holy shit... Holy shit
TopGear I dont understand the attraction to those hideous drag cars, and I am American.
TopGear That car is 4x6 so only rear axles are driving
TopGear Why no V8 turbo diesel? Range helps when youre offroad.
TopGear Me vejo pilotando essa mquina!
TopGear That drift out of Hammerhead....0o0
TopGear Le Stig test la mchante 620Rrrrrrrr caterham 620r
TopGear JACK WHITEHALL Behind the Scenes On TOP GEAR  Leaning to Drive!
TopGear fortunate sons HAHAHAHAHAHA
TopGear What was the song in the background
TopGear Looks like theyve learned nothing from their previous truck challenge. Looks like funny fails are imminent already.
TopGear best special ever so far in my opinion LOVED THE FIRST PART
TopGear I wonder how top gear makes episode in burma while in this country they are killing humanes because they are muslim this is country based on rasism search for burma and happen to muslims there
TopGear just watched the video of the hennessy venom break the world speed record not bad from the americans huWorlds Fastest: 270.49 mph Hennessey Venom GT I post the video because they have been in talks with top gear to bring it to the legendary test track and have the stig put it through the turns to see what it can do. check it out it brought a tear to my eye I think it will do the same for you.
TopGear REALLY liked the view from the inside! Work it Stigy!
TopGear what a crappy car, it sucks on corners because its traction control sucks so much its like it doesnt work.
TopGear To much power for a shit setup and Chassis, no grip even in the dry cant put the power down. Might as well restrict it to 200bhp
TopGear Looks killer, but performs poorly.
TopGear Its a shame a BMW M5 is faster than this in the wet.
TopGear you can hear dat turbo:)
TopGear he slows down on purpose!
TopGear Mass Effect 3! Awww! hahaha
TopGear hehe awesome use of music! also. Nice profile pic. actually hit my screen trying to get what i thought was a spider off it :P
TopGear THIS IS COMMANDER SHEPARD AND THIS IS MY FAVOURITE SHOW IN THE GALAXY :D
TopGear NO YOU BUFFOONS, THAT MUSIC IS FOR MASS EFFECT ONLY!
TopGear He should be grateful for actually getting pulled over by a lamborghini. I wouldnt mind. :)
TopGear 0:14 is that an Indian Bajaj Pulsar Dtsi that crosses in the frame ?
TopGear We need cop cars like that in the US!!!!!! no more crown Vics
TopGear Hammonds reacton to those rozzers are EPIC!
TopGear James what are you doing?
TopGear Dammit, I wanna see the rest!
TopGear haha, stupid smoke face!!
TopGear Bond theme song just makes me smile.
TopGear And another good new...Alfa is preparing a hotter version with 2.0 liters engine and about 320 hp.
TopGear Wow, such a beautiful car... for just 45k quid ?? That is definitely worth buying.
TopGear che gioia che mi d Top Gear!
TopGear h3 and that porsche have nothing to do with the word supercar
TopGear That Fendt 936 Vario is worth more on the market then other three vehicles combined.
TopGear Something Ive been part of, and it felt AMAZING!!!! :D I loved it!!
TopGear Then the corvette pulls up and everyone takes a pass haha
TopGear Muy buena onda ojala todos pudieramos llegar en un auto de estos a nuestro trabajo
TopGear The 24 hours at Silverstone was great because all that exhaustion allows us as viewers to get past the TV personas, especially of Hamster and Jezza, and really SEE who they are. I still remember the end of that race, where Jeremy is beside himself with emotion (YOU BRILLIANT LITTLE CAR!) and theres a quick shot of Richard sporting a smile which would shame the Cheshire Cat. That smile positively screamed relief, exhaustion and yet accomplishment, all in one moment.I really felt like I SAW them in that moment ... and one way or another, Id like to see them again, something like that.
TopGear Really, thats quick!! Faster then a lott of supercars. Looks like alfa has created a giant killer.
TopGear What was the Lap Time ??!
TopGear was that a weird engine note ir did stigy miss a gear at like 18 seconds
TopGear viva alfa romeo caralho!!! alfa romeo  budget ferrari!! but petrol onesalfa romeo diesel  50 fiat 50 alfa

TopGear I realllllly want that quadski
TopGear Where can i get this thing ?
TopGear XD Ahh this is so hilarious!!!
TopGear Down vote for profile picture, you clearly know how some people react to spiders and i assume you are intelligent enough to realize that this is not a conscious choice. So on behave of everyone, fuck you so very much.
TopGear Already watched the Top Gear Mwahaha the perks of being English )
TopGear You can tell theyre all good friends in real life!
TopGear Ah, this was so much fun!
TopGear Was there water in the glass?
TopGear omg this gave me stitches from laughter
ZONEofTECH Oh..I didnt know that. I mean...I know that partners have custom thumbnails (which I do not have at the moment for some reason). BUT I do have a Store option, which is kinda weird, because I thought only full partners have a store option. Anyway, how can I become a Full partner? thx :D
ZONEofTECH I ordered it online and it costed me about 2530. Bought it in 2010 btw. So prices are even lower now. Oh, and thank you for liking this video :D Be sure to SUBSCRIBE to my channel for more videos! Cheers!
ZONEofTECH Good video I watch all your unboxings and it has inspired me on my own channel check it out :)
ZONEofTECH Do you have a guest pass for me?
GameSack Be sure to watch to the end of the video, and comment the last word you hear to be entered in a contest for 1,000RP giveaway!
GameSack do us all a favor and stay off the internet.
GameSack not expected that fnatic would win
GameSack i give him props. it probably took at good half hour to think of those and type them all out.
GameSack Using a trollface as an avatar is not against the Youtube Terms of Use last time I checked.
GameSack Always fun to read comments section with all dem noobs writing arguments that have no logic in them.
GameSack Perfect Song! Epic video :)
GameSack He probably just copied them
GameSack They need to make a newer one with more champs an have Viktor beat all because he is amazing
GameSack sagt der richtige jerome
GameSack always waited for a moment like this  even great for this are: katarina and ziggs
GameSack score of gragas 141.. he sucks
GameSack lol 1 vs 5 but no not nice xD usually you dont see one alone doing a penta
GameSack Thats amazing :D Btw that skin rocks i have it too )
GameSack whats the name of the song?
GameSack my build is boots of cooldown dorians blade frozen mallet sunfire cape madredz bloodrazor bloodtrisher and last wisper im selling at finish the dorians blade (: and skills im use first ruthless predator and before slice and dice and before cull the meek and before again x2 ruthless predator (: thx im started with 22 atack i know renek is armor penetration but im love the full power sonick aris add me (:
GameSack Why do you chose to upgrade Ruthless before Slice N Dice?
GameSack better do this on yi meditate :D
GameSack When I stopped its because of what I said, but also the hidden reason that I couldnt figure out how to fix the rest of it in a relatively easy way... So I took the lazy way out.
GameSack Is your freind a duck? all I hear is QUACK, QUACK
GameSack I played in 2012, but i didnt know that LoL was from 2010... damn.
GameSack no but it seems like you are because u cant spell retard
GameSack Did you see the trollface at 3:16?
GameSack What is that in 2:52 ??? heimer putted something next turret O.o
GameSack I would be scared shitless if a Cho Gath was spawning killing my entire team.
GameSack tunamifreakje k i l give it a try i think i ll add voidstaff )
GameSack Yeah, stack Archangels(for straight mana since its unique) and grab a Zhonyasduring an hour long game, you can easily get 1400AP. Personally, Ive made it to 1420 or so in a 65 minute game.
GameSack Colin4316 um maybe because its seriously almost impossible to be bad with him since unless you are a complete retard no matter what he will have a lot of ap. They should take the ap gain out of his skill and only get the ap from kills I would say thats fair .
GameSack Jimmy593 veigar is still really good... amazing counter pick to ap stacking teams
GameSack j0hnnyguy Veigar gets 5 extra ap when killing champion with any source of damage, even with auto attack, if Q is maxed.
GameSack lol, i was like fuck, the meteor is taking forever to fall. I forgot this was before they patched it. At this time you needed at least lvl 4 stun to keep them there long enough to meteor
GameSack Jimmy593 he IS good...
GameSack LoL gameplay videos always have terrible ratings. Fuck the LoL community.
GameSack AzianKokazian i agree. its interesting how many greatgoodpro players are around, yet everyone complains that everyone else sucks.... hmmmm.....
GameSack Ohhh Leute wollt ihr alle mitmachen oder what! Na von mir aus du kannst das Spiel jaD
GameSack Nice ............. (.)
TopGear How did you get all the money?
TopGear look at my race http:rsg.msRdTZjs
TopGear The set up just to make one players journey harder is sooooooooo Top Gear.
TopGear All that money how is it possible ?
TopGear Id like to see you build something silly for the fun of it. turbo v8 in a mini FF or something. lol try to kill the test driver with as bad of a car that you can make.
TopGear DO IT. IT WILL BE GREAT
TopGear you filthy mud blood XDD I assure you. We brits definitely say that
TopGear God I love this so much!
TopGear Why are TheGeeNee allways drunk?
TopGear Did I hear Jimmy? First thing that comes to my head TUNABANDITS!
TopGear I was in the video:D I sucked but I was in the video :) hi ar12 I love your vids bro :D
TopGear U play race the stig?
TopGear esta buensimos los autos
TopGear Hi dude I just wanted to say that I wanted to add you if thats ok with you gamer tag is EPICZMC201471
TopGear Well done TehGingerGuy, whooping my time! Absolutely awesome editing, well done mate! :D
TopGear Meh I dont particularly like this car pack very much. However the Nissan, and the Xbox One V8 Super Car are pretty nice. I would love to see a car pack with brand new GT cars or F1 cars. Cmon turn 10 only the Lotus F1 car!! You can do better lol.
TopGear April Car pack still not many new cars most of these are from pervious games
TopGear Forza is an amazing game! Like people said, im not hating, but Turn 10 should really start coming out with ALL new cars, maybe 1 or 2 from Forza 4 per pack, but not 10 completely RECYCLED cars from Forza 4. This game is just basically next gen Forza 4 cuz like some guys said, theres only 1 or 2 new cars per pack and the rest are just recycled from Forza 4. T10 really needs to get their game faces on when it comes to DLC cuz this isnt going to be very popular unless NEW DLC is realeased. Not hating, I hope some of you guys agree
TopGear Glad i bought the vip pass and not the season pass lol these car packs are rough ..
TopGear Hey guys, can you watch some of my videos and leave a feedback, please? I would be glad :)
TopGear Absolutely dreadful. Where is the C7 Corvette? Please, get with the times.
TopGear Cant wait for Forza6 and getting the back log of cars from Forza4
TopGear Monthly Track Packs would have convinced me to keep playing Forza. Ill wait to see how Horizon 2 is and FM6. Hopefully both of those keep me engaged for more than 5 hours.
TopGear As much as I really want that Chaparral, I absolutely refuse to support this DLC system! Ill probably pick this up when it inevitably goes on sale. If this is the future of Forza, I think I need to start looking for a new racing franchise. I understand that this is a launch title, but its lost the passion that made previous Forzas so enjoyable.
TopGear oh look more cars you have to pay for that you got free in forza 4
TopGear Still waiting for the new Corvette C7 Stingray which GT5 had that over a year ago. Or just give us another track to play on (Suzuka, Road Atlanta, Nuhrburgring). If not, then give us some of the fictional tracks from Forza4 like Camino Viejo or Sunset Peninsula.
TopGear I cant tell weather this is an April folks joke or not.
TopGear the only thing is.... no P45 or GEOFF on it
TopGear BEST RACING GAME IN THE WORLD!!!!
TopGear This is good bad on timing almost six months later couldve been sooner ( just because i love this game)
TopGear im glad i didnt buy the xbox one and forza 5.
TopGear Please add more new tracks for free and all cars avalaible in free play!
TopGear 10,000th view exactly. I refreshed the page to confirm. Awesome
TopGear Just found this video... wanted to say thank you for the publicity on my IROCZ paint job. I was wondering why that particular paint was getting so many more likes and downloads compared to my other Yenko fantasy paints. Now I know. Thanks again for downloading it and unknowingly advertising it for me.
TopGear Whats with the audio? U answer their questions before theyre done saying them
TopGear Do another one of these bud with a biger budget
TopGear Tune it so you dont get wheelspin and you will do better
TopGear Good track. Keep rocking Sir NutS
TopGear Do you live in stl too?
TopGear I guess 3:50 was referring to the Vietnam special when theyre trying to pass their scooter tests and the instructor keeps saying Jeremy Clarkson...fail. XD
TopGear Just sayin, but that car racing against the Aygo in the last race is an AustinHealey.
TopGear FailRace I have a vs the community idea do a budget not a high budget like 200k do something like the Ariel atom challenge however their is a flaw as you would never be sure if people actually spent the budget but its an idea that I hope you use in some way
TopGear When do you race? and who do i add to race with the FR Community
TopGear Theres a tonne of decent cars for under 50k, great video again! If you could check my channels stuff it would be much appreciated
TopGear Ill be so amazing if i can do those top gear challenge whit you :0
TopGear Drift and wreck the Caesar and flip the cars
TopGear Ciao volevo chiederti una cosa, senza offesa...come mai non metti per intero le puntate di Top Gear? :)
TopGear Looks exactly like Subway Surfers
TopGear c63 black is not a sedan
TopGear WHERE TF IS THE HOLDEN!!
TopGear If you are gonna do top gear challenges, then please do it the way its suppose to be done. With factory stock cars, if they arent stock then it doesnt hold true to top gear challenges
TopGear You are not an amazing driver are you use the driving line and also break when you didnt when need too
TopGear I have a memory of get it in my birthday, play, hate it....Funny is when i sold the system i so didnt care about that game that i couldnt find it cart so i sold without it.... yet 1 year after i sold i found it....fast foward 12 years later the cart still in my shelf.
TopGear I have seen a dude who spent 100 on raw materials via itunes game. I just dont get it
TopGear HEY DO DRAG RACE, CHALLENGES AND MAYBE DERBY STYLE GAMEPLAYS
TopGear Can u do a dodge srt4 build it can be any type of build but can you keep the visuals the Same apart from slamming it and removing the rear wing and it can be orange and just max everything out but keep the stock srt4 motor but fully upgrade it and give it black rims but dont increase the size much I dont like them that big and can you also do a range rover jelly car plz that would all be SWAG
TopGear waWaYour mom was there too
TopGear ARRRRRRRR WHY TE FUCK IS HIS FRIEN EATING IN TO THE FUCKING MIC DISQUSTING PIG
TopGear ziJustin It doesnt help, it wont revved up fast enough and you just go slower and your RPMs are just lower ,but if you tuned down the gear so it would rev higher where its in the peak in power so that would be a useful gear. As a stock car it is just a gear for better gas mileage.
TopGear what do you use to communicate cuz it is laggy
TopGear this is like subway surfers copy.
TopGear Sub in the reasonably priced car please :)
TopGear Can i plz be in the reasonbly priced xar my name on xbox is captinstephen99
TopGear LAURENCE HAS BEEN SACKED. TOBY HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED AS A REPLACEMENT

TopGear Any news on forza horizon 2
TopGear ATENO: ESTE VDEO  UMA REPOSTAGEM!
TopGear top gear rally is the best in the series for me top gear overdrive was ok but i much preferred ridge racer 64 but i think il give it another shot if i can find it cheap cool review glenn
TopGear I have this one crakin little game and even crazier im currently watching initial d second stage haha
TopGear This is a game I really didnt get into. I think its coz I was a Ridge Racer fan and cars in this handle so differently I didnt really give it a chance. Ill either have to dig it out from under my bed or download it and try it on an emulator. I think the latter sounds like less agro.
TopGear What did you think of the Partnership Opportunity that I sent you in your YouTube inbox dude?
TopGear le 2ne1!! anche a me piace qualche loro canzone!! non ne conosco tante, :D che bello il makeup che indossi!!
GameSack alternatively...go to a YouTube converter....although not recommended as well...youd be stealing it... (not saying if LoL  Riot has it for free download that its stealing, but it would be better just to get it from the source rather than from another website)
GameSack racism has no place in our society... grow a pair and start acting more mature instead of like a 11 year old kid
GameSack i really miss the time of season 2 finals... it was just so epic.... i cant understand people who would watch something like football instead of league :D
GameSack listening to this feels like getting chased by native people in the jungle xD
GameSack Guys click me and see my rengar music and comment!
GameSack i think its like protoype claw and blade
GameSack This music is amazing, I thank you for extending this.
GameSack Zyras login BGM is the best one :) it has so much epicness in it p but thats my opinion
GameSack people say vis is best? no this one is the best!
GameSack imagine my boner extending out mah pants....now in slow motion..(queue music)
TopGear ,   .    .           !
GameSack I love it when Steve goes crazy!
GameSack I see youre wearing a Charlie Shirt :D
GameSack This show is so gayy!!!!!!
GameSack Julia Nunes (Jaaaaaaa) did the kickstarter thing. In the end, she was really successful with it! :)
GameSack FreddieW should just make the movie better with that extra money. Steve, your evil laugh is coming along. Have you chosen your evil villain name?
GameSack Youtube ISNT a government body. What Riot did WASNT ILLEGAL. The way its established is verified by Youtube itself so that you CAN UNDER YOUR OWN FREE WILL, SUBSCRIBE. Youtube ISNT POLITICS, God.
GameSack LOL, Steve is just crazy
GameSack Actually RiotGames is awesome. That skin they give away is pretty awesome. If you play the game you would understand
GameSack TheWillofDC Im surprised you didnt cover all the ish going down in the musician community the last couple weeks. A a lot of musicians with Fullscreen lost their partner status. Megan Nicole, Jason Chen and lot of other musicians. Those guys had ads on their covers which you usually dont see. So do you know what happen?
GameSack Maybe one day ill make it on to this show.
GameSack Thats how Marios name is supposed to be pronounced! Mahrio not Mawrio!!!!
GameSack This is so cool! How did JennaMarbles even get more subscribers than everybody else on YouTube last week? I think that this is the year of JennaMarbles because it wont be long now before shes 1 on YouTube! Dont you agree?
GameSack I wish League of Legends was never made. Casual version of DotA with low skill cap and nearly all skill factors removed, attracts casuals and morons.
GameSack You look more buff than usual. You must be working out or something.
GameSack Youre the best Will :D
GameSack TheWillofDC keep up the good work
GameSack lookin good will! keep it up
GameSack Oh! Youre the cutest on this channel, by far!! I hate your random computer bits drawer. We will work on this collection in the future. And by work on it, IMEANGETRIDOFIT!! Jk. :
TopGear Wow, theres some seriously pathetic people in this world. Since when did Slope become a racist term you ever heard being used? Its absurd. It seems unfortunate that somebody was crossing the bridge at the time, but who? So the people who are assigning the word slope with racist intent automatically assume the person crossing the bridge is a slope? The woman sueing is the stuppiiiiiiiidest (Clarkson voice) woman alive. Theres not a bat in hells chance she can single handedly win a case like that without the racism being directed. Another dead end actress trying to make some extra cash, what a fool.
TopGear Clarkson has a robust sense of humour aimed as much at his fellow Brits as anyone else. The leftists clearly approve of humour at the expense of Brits with jokes at English, Welsh and Scots alike. However opportunists and their greedy and corrupt lawyers are seeing pound signs here.The legal test of the man on the Clapham Omnibus show be considered. Not shrill voiced activists seeking to attack (de facto) white people. These attacks and legal actions are not made against other races. The true nature of this is bashing white people with Clarkson being made an example of.
TopGear Farkin funny but... :
TopGear Gold digger.... Really pissing off theyre being sued for this... Shes nt even Chinese....
TopGear Nice move going into high range when backing! :)
TopGear Thank you I love the show cant wait till season 5
TopGear Rutt shlda put a nose cone and a high wing and make a Daytona
TopGear Hey Rut.... ya know if you had done 30, in the 30, and not 22, Im willing to bet youd have been sitting there waiting for the horse.
TopGear And its a pile of old crap
TopGear why are there voices so deep?
TopGear Do your self a favor,watch british topgear.Omg they just copy the british version, no new ideas.Terrible waste of time
TopGear i hope that bronco has a 1000 gal tank cuz that things gotta get loke 2 mpg
TopGear What adam why arent you talking ? New voice
TopGear the irritating thing about this program is that they lie about what they do. they are not the first up there since the eruption! Arctic Trucks was there right before under and right after the eruption! they have guided tours up there! you cant claim your setting a record when your driving the same place as the tourists! the REAL top gear did it good! they took a trip too the north pole with an Arctic Trucks rebuilt Hilux! and made a race of the trip buy competing with Hammond and a dog sled. thats something too talk about.
TopGear Top gear us is a load of shit compared to the original top gear uk
TopGear whats with the Shitty overdub on the audio??
TopGear Adam, youre inspirational with your American spirit, but Im sorry... Im a Lambo fan currently in love with a McClaren. The Viper.. just no interest.
TopGear ...You would thin the presenters would know INFO about there car...Not to mention there was no Veyron SS...
TopGear Is top gear in canada ? i sure would love to drive something, either testing it out or a challenge
TopGear i want them to do a SUV challenge and to get a chevy suburban
TopGear Amazing. Thanks for uploading!!! Highly recommended for Top Gear fans.
TopGear I hope youve got your running shoes (or a folding bike) James!
TopGear Jeremy pushes hard to win although May has strategic planning on his side, could be close
TopGear who cares the show has been shit this season. why do a season in the wet season any way. plus they do laps twin and split screen fucking annoying. they did a shitty piece on the P1 no hot lap. the Porsche 918 had sponsored placement written all over it. top gear is slipping!
TopGear Can you please tell me what kind of potato this was filmed on?
TopGear Drivers are usually fat.
TopGear i subscribed for you and everyone who need its cost me nothing :)
TopGear Awsome video Karim ! Thanks for uploading it ! Keep up the good work !
ZONEofTECH is it me or does he look exactly like Andrew Garfield???
ZONEofTECH Freakn awesome YouTuber
ZONEofTECH Oh my god it is the amazing Spiderman. :D
ZONEofTECH Sapphire can shatter fairly easily, so it may not respond well to drops. Its fantastic for avoiding scratches as anyone with a nice watch can tell you.
ZONEofTECH seriusly now apple is copying samsung
ZONEofTECH Calling on the Iwatch would be a lot better
ZONEofTECH That cartoon clip really sucks
ZONEofTECH i like your videos man keep up the good work
ZONEofTECH these look so genuine!! great video
ZONEofTECH of course i would pick 2 but we all know that can take a while until it is made but if i would choose a concept that can be ma with the technology and engineering that we have today, then i would pick concept 3
ZONEofTECH 5 was best and most practical
ZONEofTECH My favorites were 5 and 2 the look like they would be taken out and released
ZONEofTECH i would buy number 2 the moment it comes out
ZONEofTECH I think 4 needs to be longer...lol
ZONEofTECH Number 4 is kinda silly
ZONEofTECH Number 1 is cool but there is no way there would be 4K video the hard drive would have to be huge to support that kind of resolution. Plus the mini aux thing would cause a riot because people would have to get new headphones or adapters. Still really kool though!
ZONEofTECH the 1st one would make Apple even mor popular and rich and it Looks amazing
ZONEofTECH I think the iPhone Air was the best. In my opinion this is what Id expect from iPhone 6. :D
ZONEofTECH Would be amazing if they would make it like 1
ZONEofTECH Man, 2 million hits, youre doing great, dude! Probably because your videos are so well done. I see big things in your future!
ZONEofTECH All your guesses are certainly interesting, but Apple never seems to release an array of monstrous upgrades like your video walks through  so my guess is that maybe one or two of your guess, maybe even three come true IF that. Still would be cool though. Def worth all the holding out some people have been doing for iPhone 6 hopefully.
ZONEofTECH Yea a new iphone! Now that should do with my 5s? make a video of different ways to destroy it ! :)
ZONEofTECH Um Bluetooth charging? Impossible
ZONEofTECH Galaxy note 3 competitor would be iphablet by apple and they better patent the name before someone else think of it! Lol
ZONEofTECH you look lyk andrew garfield... (guy from amazing spiderman)
ZONEofTECH Why would they do anything different then the iphone 5s? Its sad that people expect apple to do something different for once.
ZONEofTECH Does anyone else feel Samsung always rushes into launching their new technology slightly too fast? :
ZONEofTECH it doesnt even look well presented i got bored ...
ZONEofTECH TheRandomActivity first off iphones will always sell more that copycat samsung and dont fucking argue with that because its very clear who copied who. All i gotta do is look at the homebutton on the iphone and galaxys and know that samsung was inspired by apple. And by the way what makes samsung better? Useless features lol cmon the iphone can do pretty much everything samsung still cant do when its jailbroken. Samsung still cant fix their lag and their phones break much faster than iphones
ZONEofTECH When he said the gear 2 was sheek I thought he said shit
ZONEofTECH He looks like Andrew Garfield
ZONEofTECH You look like Peter Parker from the amazing spiderman )
ZONEofTECH Friday! Lold at the Rebecca black reference xD
ZONEofTECH Amazing review bro keep up the good work. You just got a new subscriber!!
ZONEofTECH Great video. Like it. Subscribe to see the news for the S5.
ZONEofTECH I dont understand the race to having bigger displays. Any bigger and its a small tablet. I dont want anything bigger. I want it to fit comfortably in my jeans pocket.
ZONEofTECH ulgy iphone the new Galaxy S6 look better I hoe it goin b faster
ZONEofTECH Love when he says aluminum lol
ZONEofTECH West. For. I phone. 6
ZONEofTECH I just hope they move forward with the OS...
ZONEofTECH Looks like someone put a iphone button on a gs4
ZONEofTECH The iPhone 6 looks like a samsung galaxy to me
ZONEofTECH Santa brought me a piece of broccoli :
ZONEofTECH I got a lot of mlb items
ZONEofTECH Ive hot a bad ass 24 fullhd monitor :)
ZONEofTECH For Christmas I got a kitchen thermometer for food, some Tshirts and a Bumper for my iPhone 4s. Merry Christmas also for you ! :D
ZONEofTECH nothing I got nothing for Christmas
ZONEofTECH Santa bought me new earrings!
ZONEofTECH hopefully a suprise (FedEx hasnt knocked on my door yet)
ZONEofTECH Yes, you should give one away :3
ZONEofTECH Do you want a robot for your iPhone or Android phone?Meet the NEW Sphero 2.0!
ZONEofTECH Can you do a benchmark of Diablo 3 and Starcraft II on this Mac through MacOSX?
ZONEofTECH DAYUM, Well thats just the same specs as an AlienWare 17x

ZONEofTECH Can u post call of duty black ops 2
ZONEofTECH NEW VIDEO!Battlefield 4 on the NEW 15 Retina MacBook Pro!

ZONEofTECH Bro! I love the mcbook pro but havent had the chance to have one!
ZONEofTECH Hello I would like to purchase your MacBook Pro 2013 please contact me for more info
ZONEofTECH Im so gonna get this for my birthday
ZONEofTECH 64 bit means nothing unless you have 4gb  ram... Performance will not change otherwise. :D
ZONEofTECH Yay Nexus 5 has LESS BLOATWARE!!! But in the long run, S4s features are way worth it
ZONEofTECH Thats really fast for a phone, too bad it doesnt boot in 4 seconds like windows 8 and an awesome ssd

ZONEofTECH Working on them now, sorry for the delay. They should be up in no more than 30min, Thank you for your patience! Daniel ZONEofTECH
ZONEofTECH Yes, I actually covered this in my Samsung Galaxy S4 videos. If you want, feel free to check that out as well :)
ZONEofTECH The Cell processor is single core with 6 SPEs. They act behave like CPU cores but in fact theyre not. Theys just CPU processes, thats what they are. Anyway, the GPU is the one that matters in gaming, not the CPU. The A5Xs GPU is 3x more powerful than the PS3s 550 MHz NVIDIASCEI RSX Reality Synthesizer. Conversation ENDED.
ZONEofTECH What does the Galaxy S4 do? Serious question.
ZONEofTECH what do yall think iphone 5s or iphone 5c
ZONEofTECH gamesradar(dot)comnewlyannouncedipad3maybemorepowerfulps3and360willitreallymattergaming Heres a link :) If you want Ill even find Apples keynote in which they say this. Keep in mind that the PS3 has 2006 hardware which is nowhere near the devices we have today. The thing with the PS3 is that the games are extremely optimised, thats why they look so amazing on such weak hardware. If I have time Ill try and make a video explaining this in more detail. Cheers Anthony!
ZONEofTECH What is the one more thing??????
ZONEofTECH funny video and a cool video at the same time !
ZONEofTECH iphone 5S5 speed iphone 5c5 crap
ZONEofTECH Hey Petr! Thanks for another great comment! :D
ZONEofTECH Still the same garbage
ZONEofTECH Usually at least one week before the rumoured event. So my guess would be September the 3rd.
ZONEofTECH Traded my 4s for an s4
ZONEofTECH are companies allowed to go at each other like that ? isnt that unprofessional ?
ZONEofTECH The same shit and more expensive thats the main difference
ZONEofTECH scratch it with a real diamond and see how well it holds out
ZONEofTECH And you deserve my like :)
ZONEofTECH Holy shit a 100 dollar sticker
ZONEofTECH Maybe both :P Im the kind of guy that isnt obsessed with the console but for games :)

ZONEofTECH NICE, at last i ve managed to find a professional camera preview, 10X.
ZONEofTECH I do have the galaxy s4 i9500 and i love everything about the camera except 3 things (1. Video recording stabilization 2. Noisy voice when recording video 3. Slowing auto focus)
ZONEofTECH Thats shit if they start doing this bullshit plastic Id rather switch to samsung fuck apple royally if they do this cheap shit...
ZONEofTECH Who said anything about iOS 6? It is going to have iOS 7.
ZONEofTECH What sort of videos would you like to see? :)
ZONEofTECH Mine doesnt do that anymore. Please help):
ZONEofTECH I have a MacBook Air, 13, mid2011
ZONEofTECH actually i didnt buy any one yet, i still waiting recommendation i know that Apple Display is the better choice but i live in Morocco and i couldnt find it here, yes there are many Monitors like Dell Samsung and others, but unfortunately there arent Apple Monitors maybe because apple doesnt have a store in morocco yet, so what kind of monitors can you recommend, thanks again  im so sorry about my bad English :)
ZONEofTECH I just had to ask cause a lot of people who do unboxings, will do video game unboxings as well
ZONEofTECH BLAH BLA BLAH....BLAH...BLAH BLAH......TOO MUCH OF STUPIDITY SAY THINGS THAT HAVE MEANING AND BE SERIOUS..YOU ARE ACTING LIKE AN IMMATURE KID
ZONEofTECH Keep it up :) i love your content especially iOS 7 videos
ZONEofTECH 9000 subscribers and 16 views for a video :( Makes me want to quit.
ZONEofTECH please make a video about scrolling up and down by tilting the device or eyes, because i couldnt do it.
ZONEofTECH the translucent case looks awesome i want it too
ZONEofTECH Will there also be a more regular iPhone 5s or 6?? Or will there just be lower costing iPhones made of plastic? Or is that unknown?
ZONEofTECH Is this option on the mini
ZONEofTECH apple rock its a great one you should try it its relaible especially with a 80 megapixel camera so ha suck a dick idiot!!!
ZONEofTECH iPhone 5s camera is 8 Megapixels, dumbass. Congratulations, you just put together the stupidest string of verbal diarrhea ever shat out on to the internet. Bravo.
ZONEofTECH Ha!! What a piece of shit i hope you fandroids realize the iphone 5 camera is still 80 megapixels you fandroids will never get stuff as good as us apple lovers
ZONEofTECH Correction: You might get it to review and give away to me.

ZONEofTECH Zone of tech. Do you have apple tv because i just got one and dont know how to hook up like airplay with it. And do all the mirroring stuff with ios 7(iphone 4s) Thanks!!
ZONEofTECH I honestly think iPod touch 4g shouldve had ios7 since the iPhone4 has it and they both have the a4 chip.
ZONEofTECH Great video! I have a 4s and this beta 2 has been terrible. Deathly slow, constant crashes and freezes.
ZONEofTECH as much as i love apple they need to stop talking shit about pc and windows
ZONEofTECH I downloaded ios7 for my iphone5 and my control center was a solid grey but I got some help from someone else and I resolved the problem but thank you for responding!

ZONEofTECH im on a laptop a windows laptop and it dont work what shell i do ??
ZONEofTECH I cant open the windows RecBoot... plz help!!!
ZONEofTECH Hi! I have a question. Will this beta 4 expire and will it make my iphone be bricked?
ZONEofTECH What happens if i dont restore?
ZONEofTECH So do I have to restore to beta 1 then restore to beta 2 and so on and so forth? Like in order?
ZONEofTECH I dont understand how to do it
ZONEofTECH its not downloading as a ispw, it keeps downloading as a dmg.
ZONEofTECH what is it new or backup
ZONEofTECH this couldnt be any easier! THANKS ALOT!!
ZONEofTECH I unlocked my phone myself... Will it mess with anything in that sort? Like make my iPhone not unlocked anymore?
ZONEofTECH You do realize what would have means, right?
ZONEofTECH Searching for an artist with the new screen if you have hundreds of them looks more cumbersome than sliding the index in the old Music app, which I manage to do with one hand while driving.
ZONEofTECH I think it changes along with your wallpaper.
ZONEofTECH fucks sake, I have an the new iPod 5th gen, I do no want radio, iCloud, genius or iTunes integrated into the music app, I get my music from CDs and torrents, I discover new music on youtube like everyone else and sync it straight to the ipod, simple. This is just a bullshit way for apple to make people spend unnecessary quantities of money on the spot. I have no use for the radio as most of the time its not connected to any network. Thanks apple.
ZONEofTECH i know its not even in canada yet probably on the next ios update
ZONEofTECH Not hands on lying cunts. Fuck off and die linkbait motherfucker.
ZONEofTECH I think it is ugly as hell, And they have taken away a lot of features. I will return to the pc market after waiting all these years it looks like a coffee pot. If this is what apple thinks is going to lead them for the next 10 years I think they have another thing coming,
ZONEofTECH So was R2D2. So what. :)
ZONEofTECH Apple are pathetic they didnt install NFC or there products so tried to make an app to replace it then tried to take to piss ahahaha Apple always stealing other peoples ideas.
ZONEofTECH you can use wifi OR BLUETOOTH. And Apple is stealing other (you mean Samsung, right?) people ideas?! You think Samsung invented Bluetooth?! Its not samsungsapples idea!
ZONEofTECH I did see that. I was just replying to Raghu Kalyan, though. :)
ZONEofTECH joey009ism i didnt see samsung using air drop but nfc so apple didnt steal there ideas
ZONEofTECH it looks like most people in the comments are confused between NFC and airdrop. NFC with Android beam establishes a temporary bluetooth connection to transfer data. Where as airdrop, the iPhone would ping other iOS 7 devices in the area with their own WiFi signal and make connection that way to send data. Now this isnt an immediate solution to Android beam because NFC goes beyond sending data between phones where your phone can be used as a wallet with NFC registers amongst many other services
ZONEofTECH It seems that if theres no wifi available IOS 7 will simply use bluetooth to do Airdrop
ZONEofTECH No airdrop for iPhone 4S :(
ZONEofTECH I found it on google and added the Safari logo in it. So even if it were made by you, I did modify it.
ZONEofTECH Correction even when the firmware beta expires if its already installed on your phone you can still use it...
ZONEofTECH Im an Apple user and this is . How about taking notes while watching a video?, using the calculator while viewing your Notes ? This is something I really want to see item do. And samsung has had this feature on their mobiles for some time now .
ZONEofTECH faggidy skippady foopady, i busted a nut on ur sisters left cheek last night aftersheu sucked my cock. blahh
ZONEofTECH Ha ha. He wants to buy the Chevy
ZONEofTECH I dont like new voice.
ZONEofTECH Finally we can have a male voice
ZONEofTECH The ultimate surveillance device for NSA  the illuminati new world order
ZONEofTECH Ik i probably wont win but i would love it! I usually dont get much as i still have my ipod touch 1g!!
ZONEofTECH Someone Tell Apple To Put The Camera In The Back I Bought And Its Shit
ZONEofTECH would you ever consider giving it away?
ZONEofTECH If you dont have a camera on the back you can just take a picture with the front camera turn it around
ZONEofTECH Riot Points Codes totally free takeVisit: RiotCodesGenerator. com.I just got points code from there!!
ZONEofTECH Riot now has an official mac installer so you can just use that now.
ZONEofTECH Get free working LoL Riot Points from here: .FreeRiotPointsCodes.om online points codes generator  try it, no regret!!
ZONEofTECH Are you running mac os x 10.9in this video?
ZONEofTECH But why did xbox changed it to black huuuhhh
ZONEofTECH I was thinking the same. I have spent countless hours staring at the beauty of the original, pointless bulk under the controller. Why fix what isnt broken, right? I mean WHO NEEDS BETTER ERGONOMICS!? Problem?
ZONEofTECH xbox one killed and t baged ps4
ZONEofTECH J allard is a hero of our day!
ZONEofTECH Why do people come on here and just say one console is shot and the other is good that both do the se at the end of the day you just play games on them
ZONEofTECH Please explain how this console stacks up to my i52500k 4.4GHz processor with 8GB of utilized RAM, 500GB SSD,3 case fans with aftermarket coolers on GPU and CPU, 850W power supply, and soon to be GTX 680(currently 6950 well overclocked to play any games on ultra). I can do anything that these can do and more and its at least 6 months before theyve even be released. By the end of the year theyll be completely outdated.
ZONEofTECH Awwgh, I needed that for an important subject.
ZONEofTECH So if airplane mode is turned on, u cant track the iPhone using Find My iPhone right?
ZONEofTECH Surprisingly number one is fairly close to the real deal
ZONEofTECH I also like that first feature in 5 (the first one)
ZONEofTECH Concept 1 ( the last one)
ZONEofTECH Pretty cool concepts! Realistically speaking, though, with Ive at helm iOS7 will most likely be a cosmetic makeover than a functional one. Afraid that since Jobs death Apple is no longer that forwardthinking anymore. Just my two cents.
ZONEofTECH Me too I like the last 1
ZONEofTECH The last choice, cause you can see a big difference between the iOS not just a tweak.
ZONEofTECH widgets for IOS haha, theres a few decades until apple gets that farby then google will be running holograms on android phones
ZONEofTECH They will send you the money to your bank account, at the end of each month. Therefore you need to provide them with your bank account.
ZONEofTECH I would probably go for it after my 5 gets old. so a few years.
ZONEofTECH thank you very much for your advice!!! it really helps me!!! as for the videos i have see the two of them!!! now im gonna check the other six!!! D
ZONEofTECH Never get a galaxy phone they suck
ZONEofTECH In the uk its coming out 13th of September
ZONEofTECH this is the biggest bullshit ever :)
ZONEofTECH No such thing as an iPhone 5 s
ZONEofTECH thats their goal... Hence the Galaxy part...
ZONEofTECH What really was the point of them making this phone o? The S4 is WAY better!
ZONEofTECH I knew it. I have an s3 mini. S3 mini wins
ZONEofTECH I have an iphone 4, should i sell it and get an s3 mini
ZONEofTECH But i like the way of your reviews and u did well
ZONEofTECH How can I fix my my control center because instead of it being translucent its a solid grey!
ZONEofTECH Thanks, be sure to like it and share it so more people can see it. Ive worked really hard for this (6h on average on each video  48h in total), unfortunately I do not have that many views. :(
ZONEofTECH it isnt epic. the iphone much better
ZONEofTECH I have been having my gs3 for a while now but for some reason I want to buy the iPhone 5s when it comes out instead of the gs4
ZONEofTECH i personally love android coz of customiation. so i win :)
ZONEofTECH S3 mini battery lasts 3 days ? LMAO it barely goes through day without charging .
ZONEofTECH Lookin at this at my gs3 mini :)
ZONEofTECH s3 mini much better, considering the price and all
ZONEofTECH Wow, thx :D I guess you meant 2012, Ive started this channel in 2012 August :P
ZONEofTECH clearly hes been playing iphone more as he is on much further in the games
ZONEofTECH Samsung is just awsome face it
ZONEofTECH Win the camera of iPhone 4s
ZONEofTECH samsung is way better retard!
ZONEofTECH S3 mini is the best!!! :)
ZONEofTECH iphone 4s yeahhhhhhhh
ZONEofTECH I know that I love ya man and it always showing entertaining videos
ZONEofTECH The plastic it is cheap mine fallen on the floor and it haves a scratch I it even wasnt that high maybe 2 or 1 half feet drop
ZONEofTECH What ROM is on it ? 4.2 ?
ZONEofTECH In your headphones :)
ZONEofTECH Does the s3 mini support USB OTG and MHL (TVOUT)?
ZONEofTECH So my porn will be high definition?
ZONEofTECH This is the best phone in the world. Its a beast. 441 ppi on a 5 inch display, 2600MHz removable battery, 13mp camera, just hit over 27,000 on atutu benchmark, Innovation, Innovation and innovation, Samsung did a fantastic job with this beast. All this in a smaller footprint than the SGS3. So much more than you can write about. Thank You Samsung
ZONEofTECH Check out this video on YouTube: I want this phone time to start saving
ZONEofTECH Iphone is still a good phone I personally love galaxy more I have the s3 galaxy s4 is a monster of a phone because well galaxy dares to go into the future while iphones sheer simplicity is so easy to use but the galaxy lets you have your phobe your way with NO restrictions... GO Galaxy!! !!
ZONEofTECH when does it come out?
ZONEofTECH you meant CAT3 100 Mega Bits per second mind the difference :)
ZONEofTECH Yes Im getting one and yes its better than an iPhone
ZONEofTECH 1:26 you said does 100 MBPS Megabytes. Isnt that too fast lol.
ZONEofTECH I have galaxy s3. I am stucked with it. I wish Id have gotten iphone. All the features are stupid and never work the way they suppose to s3. I am sure that will test in this 4 or whatever
ZONEofTECH I like how these new, awesome features are actually noticeable, influential, and helpful. Unlike certain platforms that make a HUGE deal out a still small 4 in. screen, a bit lighter body, and a little resolution improvement. cough APPLE cough
ZONEofTECH hey its not big . dimensions of s4 is same as s3. but the screen is slightly bigger thats all.check it if u want !!!!! :):):):):):)
ZONEofTECH cel mai penal telefon posibil
ZONEofTECH is the best cellphone ever!!! I think this is insane!!! I just cant wait to have it on my hands...just awsome!!
ZONEofTECH Is that Octocore legit? Or bullshit?
ZONEofTECH This is the best racing game I had played. Nice control than other racing games. Thank god it is free!
ZONEofTECH no words its awesome :)
ZONEofTECH Most models will probably be stuck to 4 cores due to battery life.
ZONEofTECH if all of these features are true, APPLE can SUCK it
ZONEofTECH I will BUY S4... JUST TO MESS with APPLE fan boys...
ZONEofTECH Cant wait birthday coming up parents getting me one hopefully
ZONEofTECH Pretty interesting And worth downloading to see the graphics But I doubt its worth using ur money to buy all the extra stuff cause it would than be hard to keep up
ZONEofTECH I think the Samsung Galaxy S4 is going to be almost identical as the GS3, but with a bigger screen, more powerful CPU and more ram. And a 13 MP camera as well.
ZONEofTECH Cant say this looks better than COD graphics from XBOX 360 or PS3
ZONEofTECH Guerilla really has a way of releasing their titles that push the graphics from their previous leading title by tenfold. They really put work into all that is to make it LOOK good, but sometimes their mechanics and gameplay falls short against the graphics side and it stays mediocre. From the looks of this demo, Im REALLY pumped for some highkicker action gameplay and some serious multiplayer experiences. Keep it coming, Guerilla.
ZONEofTECH Haha :))))) thats some ! EPIC profile picture! Cheers mate!
ZONEofTECH My mate goes that his dad got it for him from china
ZONEofTECH for the i watch r they going to have like 8 gb models or 16 gb model?
ZONEofTECH You people just need to get galaxy gear and buy Samsung devices
ZONEofTECH Revealed when it hasnt come out yet? Hows that possible, true that these things might have it. But guess what!! There still guesses, why dont you start every sentence with It might have or even this watch may have because thats all you doing. Is guessing at the end of the day, smart guessing with other people reports. But still guessing, just wait for the thing to come out...if it ever comes out
ZONEofTECH probably not going to have oled screen, tim cook hates them
ZONEofTECH but i think that it dont have siri
ZONEofTECH people are gonna say that your crazy if you talk to your watch
ZONEofTECH What happens when it rains when you have this on
ZONEofTECH To let u know thats not the real ps4 its a fake
ZONEofTECH thanks dude u the best man!!! IT REALLY WORKED

ZONEofTECH The Windows Support cant install with Win8, any suggestion?
ZONEofTECH What are the benefits of installing wondows on a mac?
ZONEofTECH installing windows on mac is such a foolish thing one can ever do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH I hate windows 8, I will use windows 7 till the day it becomes so out of date it useless! i did try it i installed it on my pc to see what it would be like, was allot faster then windows 7, that was nice. And thats the only good thing I have to say...i hate the interface in every way. i want my real desktop and start menu that i have been using since windows 95. i have realized that Im a releic now it seems in the computer world and everyone else is starting to move on. but i still make my desktop like windows 982000! i add the my computer icon and my documents and all that other stuff just like windows was back then.... maybe i have problems idk but i dont like change and i dont want my computer turning into a smart phone thats for sure! and Mac OS is scaring me to. I have a feeling 10.9 is the last OS X 10 i bet the next one will be like OS X 11.0 and will be like a iPhone or iPad...... im scared!!!!! :(
ZONEofTECH Thanks man, i searched long and hard and your video is one of the few that does a proper walk through.
ZONEofTECH Thanks for your video.. But i have a question.. When you do a partition with bootcamp, and install windows 8, The computer becomes slow? Or when you use windows 8 is slow? Or is same ?...
ZONEofTECH I plan on either building a PC or buying a Windows 8 desktop. My iMac was given to me because my laptop crapped out on me. The iMac cant run the programs I need for what I want to do so those are my options including Bootcamp.
ZONEofTECH Format your Mac OS hard drive

ZONEofTECH Super ultra gaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy
ZONEofTECH Yeah, I know. Thats why I bought it in the 1st place. BTW thx for commenting on my last 3 videos:) Cheers mate
ZONEofTECH People who buy iPhone: OMG! The new iPhone is gonna have a better camera. People will think they actually are looking at what im eating on instagram. MUST UPGRADE Android:The screen has only been made 0.5 bigger, and 13 mp isnt much of and improvement. But I like the fact that I dont have to touch to the phone to use it. Meh not worth the upgrade
ZONEofTECH wrong. the 5 and 5s are switched around
ZONEofTECH Made up on the spot for money
ZONEofTECH This is a lie apple said its coming out fall 2013
ZONEofTECH this is nothing on spec the new iphone is a confirmed iPhone 5s it runs a quadcore a7 chip also running a m7 chip theres major improvements like a finger scanner witch lets you set your fingerthumb print as your password many other improvements but you lot aint worth the time it would take to explain
ZONEofTECH the icons have a lower quality actually
ZONEofTECH i was just saying :) im sorry :)
ZONEofTECH Here is what I HATE (yes HATE!) about their new and crappy version of iTunes...I spent MONTHS finding original and rare album covers for singles for thousands of songs which could be displayed with the cover flow, which made iTunes LOOK LIKE a virtual jukebox (actually way better). Now...I get a tiny picture. My music library now looks like CRAP. The new iTunes SUCKS! I make playlists and if I click a song, that song and ONLY THAT SONG plays?!?!?! I have to select all the songs in the playlist for it to play?!?!? What is a playlist for? Play the damn songs!SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS!Your presentation didnt address any of these problems.
ZONEofTECH Is cover flow even available on iTunes 11?
ZONEofTECH has anyone found a way to create an aac version of a certain mp3 file?
ZONEofTECH I also listed to Heavy metal and Hard Rock, but maybe you could see the albums in the video. Disturbed, Papa Roach, Linkin Park, Skillet and so on :)
ZONEofTECH Look you can hate on me all you want, but you have the worst taste in music I have ever seen! Heavy metal and Hard Rock til the day I die!!!
ZONEofTECH i have windows but i am going to buy macbook air. its expensive but i really like it ,also i am afraid that apple may release macbook air with retina display in 2013 ,it would be like disaster to me. because after i buy mac 2012 i wont be able to buy another for the next five years.so tell what should i do .
ZONEofTECH Yeah I would switch i upgrade every year
ZONEofTECH Thx, Im glad you enjoyed my video :D Please like, share (so more people can see it ) and SUBSCRIBE to support me :D Cheers! :D
ZONEofTECH i am using windows 7, mac os 9, mac os 10,4 tiger, ubuntu. see i use a lot of different computers. but i prefer mac because it just works the best. my powermac g4 quicksilver has 800 mhz and plays hd 720p videos with vlc
ZONEofTECH Im using Mountain Lion, Leopard, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
ZONEofTECH so the new xbox will be a gaming computer with a nintendo controller.... Microsoft, I am dissapoint!
ZONEofTECH Why should they make a screen on the controller?! I bearly trust my little niece with my controller now
ZONEofTECH The controller looks fuckin stupid
ZONEofTECH What a bs video. The next generation of xbox HSA not yet been announced.
ZONEofTECH on board speakers? if my tv doesnt have speakers. what? thats probably going to in microsoft terms jack up the price by a 100.
ZONEofTECH Its something called mass production. When you produce something in mass, you get tons of discounts. So the production cost is going to be around 180200 at the beginning (which means 20 profit per console), but in time the production cost will lower to bout 80100 which is the production cost of a ps3xbox 360 now.
ZONEofTECH i would say yes AT FIRST to keep games and players available, then the later gens might lose compatibility as the 360 market slowly dries up. look at the 3DS, it didnt have compatibility for the original DS, so therefore when it released with only couple of games and a sketchy gimmick, many preferred to stick to the old DS(xl)
ZONEofTECH standard for computer not for console which will retail price for a massive loss u tit
ZONEofTECH By the way the is a Stem box it is called xi3
ZONEofTECH you cant sellect random for A.I so this glitch doesnt work anymore
ZONEofTECH Does it not work for HotS or something? The option for changing race in HotS is locked
ZONEofTECH Are the patches nesisary?
ZONEofTECH The Random button is no more available....:
ZONEofTECH Hahah :)) ok.. Ill do it tomorrow. :D Ill promise. I was just too lazy and busy (mostly busy) to do it. TOMORROW WE DINE IN HELL!!!!
ZONEofTECH and yeah i was wondering if it still worked,just for other players as the interface has changed
ZONEofTECH Ill make a new video for Heart of the Swarm in the following days. Stay tune :D NOTE: Its going to be on my 2nd channel ZONE0fGAMING :)
ZONEofTECH Maybe they got rid of the glitch. Anyway, be sure to follow the instructions from the description precisely.

ZONEofTECH why get this when you can get an ipod classic, its exactly the same just that it is a bit thicker and bigger, also its mainly know for its storage space and it has 160gb version, and if you dont care about storage space you clearly dont care about music.

screenjunkies Bem... chega de chatear as pessoas.Mas entendam que  o efeito que Breaking Bad causa nas pessoas, como podemos ler neste depoimento da articulista da revista americana New Yorker. http:nyr.kr19UBibgPara quem ainda no conhece e ficou curioso, e no assustado com essa compulso que a srie provoca assine o servio Netflix Brasil. L encontrase os episdios (com opo de legendas, ou dublados) at a 4 temporada, livres para exibio (a primeira parte da 5 ser liberada em setembro).Para os demais, j devidamente iniciados e perdidos no vcio de acompanhar as desventuras de Walter e Jesse, proponho uma risada final vendo o Trailer Honesto de Breaking Bad.(O vdeo tem SPOILERS e legendas)

screenjunkies Coming this summer The GenderBender
screenjunkies I think you annoyed him when you asked about Jennifer ya jackass!
screenjunkies damnn he is a really nice guy
screenjunkies I think its at 2:11 where he even isnt vince vaughn cause he already said he wish he was dead.
screenjunkies I always think Vince Vaughn comes across as a twat
screenjunkies People responded well to the film? Ha! Hahaha! HAHAHahahah! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
screenjunkies Think you struck a nerve there with the whole Jen Anniston spiel
screenjunkies I think he was annoyed when you asked him if he was dead.
screenjunkies This guy is straight up clowning. Too funny...
screenjunkies Well both of them are overglorified action stars but at least Rock speaks his lines and doesnt do that god awful mumbling...
screenjunkies I like a Rock. I mean, THE rock.
screenjunkies Hey Hal, I like to watch your mom
screenjunkies Yo, fuck you, hes great.
screenjunkies The Peoples Champion. ...That is all...
screenjunkies Ask Nick Mundy whos better: The Rock or Vin Diesel.
screenjunkies A robot can act with more passion an believability then Vin Diesel can
screenjunkies I would have james mcavoy as Picard and Jim parsons as data... Just think about it.
screenjunkies I think that instead of making all these reboots and sequels, someone in Hollywood need to come up with an original ideal. And we need an all new Star Trek series on TV ...
screenjunkies I hope they dont reboot it if they dont have Patrick Stuart. Lets face it, Picard is only Picard because of Patrick Stuart. Take that away and its no longer Picard.
screenjunkies Picard Patrick StewartRiker Bradley CooperWorf Samuel l Jackson Data Tom HiddlestonLaforge Chiwetel Ejofor
screenjunkies Funny that they mentioned Lost to Star Trek not being a very huge leap, I think Terry OQuinn would be a good Picard.
screenjunkies dude is abrams got his hands on NextGeneration it would actually, literally, no joke, kill people from the badness.
screenjunkies dude wtf they picked young actresses for dr. crusher but in the series she was older like picard. i woulda gone with julianne moore. she would be fuckin perfect
screenjunkies sorry guys, but Ive never seen such a bunch of lame stupid people! Kevin (the second on the left) is the only one who still has a brain. The dude with the yellow shirt just belongs to an asilum for retarded
screenjunkies The reboot movies suck because the narrative got so far stuck up there own asses all I could see was shit.
screenjunkies Crowdsourced campaign to stop celebrity Kickstarter projects
screenjunkies Oh, and Ill have to defer to Mel Brooks on the two rules to funding a production from the musicalplay The Producers Rule number one. Never Ever Never use your own money. Max Whats rule number Two Max?  Bloom NEVER USE YOUR OWN MONNNEEEEEEEEYYYYYY!!!!  Max, very loud.
screenjunkies That doesnt automatically mean theyre being serious about this. Its a stupid kickstarter. The guy doesnt even seem serious when hes going on about it. Its obviously a joke.
screenjunkies Donate 50 dollars and get an exclusive limited run tshirt. Funny because Im like Yo! Thats 50 dollars for a tshirt. Limited edition, lets do some simple addition, 50 dollars for a tshirt, thats just some ignorant bitch.
screenjunkies Unless this is some form of metatrolling where you purposefully become hypocrites to reveal the stupidity of the situation, this is fucking stupid. Dont back people with money to do vanity projects that they could fund themselves, now fund us to make a vanity project that we could fund ourselves. GENIUS TROLLING OR COMPLETE HYPOCRISY! I agree that perhaps the money could be put to better use or other projects by those with less financial clout but really? Not worth an Indiegogo campaign :P
screenjunkies What if he just wanted people involved with it I mean seriously .....why not make a video on Matt Damon trying gr
screenjunkies Why not do this to honey boo boo, would be much more constructive in my opinion.
screenjunkies The only good thing about this channel are the honest trailers.
screenjunkies Just dont give him money if you dont like the idea?! I mean, its as easy as that. Geez!
screenjunkies CUDDLEFISSHSHSHSSHSHHHH
screenjunkies Disgusting. Tom Six is a poor excuse for a human being. He should have kept this filth in his head.
screenjunkies Ill like for your comment, even though I dont agree... I learned alot from that film! :P
screenjunkies His mothers reaction is priceless! XD
screenjunkies The most awkward thing Ive ever watched with my parents, might have been when me and my dad saw The Watchmen in theaters and the sex scene came on. We were both so damn uncomfortable, I saw his arm twitch and raise up a little like he wanted to reach over and cover both our eyes lol
screenjunkies I have seen that film
screenjunkies At least in the first one, I was able to sit through it fairly easyily. In the second one, I had to force myself to watch it. It just makes me so sick. Glad I watched it though so I dont feel like Im missing something lol.
screenjunkies Almost everyone Ive talked to (besides 1) either didnt like Man of Steel or hated it. Why though?! I loved it! Even after seeing it twice, it was awesome!
screenjunkies This is what happened1 iron man 32 despicable me 23 man of steel4 monsters university5 fast and furious6 star trek into darkness7 world war z8 the heat9 were the millers10 the great gatsby
screenjunkies Actual list of top 10 highest grossing movies of summer 2013:1. Iron Man 32. Despicable Me 23. Man of Steel4. Monsters University5. Fast  Furious 66. Star Trek Into Darkness7. World War Z8. The Heat9. The Great Gatsby10. The Conjuring
screenjunkies Pacific rim and man of steel were utter crap, and iron man 3? Come on!!!!! I had to play it (upon DVD release) like several times just to finish it, bored the crap outta me
screenjunkies Man of steel was so Boring! The only reason i survived it was cause i was cracking jokes with my friend about how many scenes were so similar to other movies ! Big cgi piece of shit : the actors were so one dimensional !! Iron Man 3 s story was way better
screenjunkies Kristian Harloff, where did you get your shirt. I WANT ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies despicable me 2 beat monsters university the lone ranger and it was the number 1 movie in the world but iron man was only 1 movie in America and I think man of steel beat 10 times better than iron man 3
screenjunkies Video you need to do: PRINCESS BRIDE, DESPICABLE ME 1 OR 2. Things you should say: 1) NO MORE RHYMING NOW I MEAN IT! ANYONE WANNA PEANUT? 2) ALWAYS REMEMBER TO ASK YOURSELF, WHO AMERICAS NEXT TOP MODEL? 3)  MOM CHARLIE BIT ME!!!! Well thats all i have for today thanks! :)
screenjunkies Why isnt Kick Ass 2 on either of their lists!!
screenjunkies Said Star Trek was dogshit but Man of Steel would be great, wow, dude got buttfucked at cinemas by man of steel.
screenjunkies I ate at that Hooters across from the Summit where the Rockets used to play, but now the Summits Joel Osteens church :)

screenjunkies Mark Wahlberg is my idol
screenjunkies CaptainSparklez or Robotboys!!

screenjunkies Prohibition. Ingredients: Jager, vodka, rum, a mixed drink (4 liters worth) containing a 4060 balance of a diet soda of your choice and Blue Ball beer, the first two seasons of Boardwalk Empire. How to play: Every time Steve Buscemi says bad is good, take a shot of rum. Every time the fword is dropped in any context, take a shot of jager. During sex scenes, chug the mixed drink until said scene ends. Every time a character is introduced and dies within the same episode, take a shot of vodka.

screenjunkies This is the longest time I have ever stared at people staring at each other...
screenjunkies it took me a while to finish the video it ended with me laughing all over the floor with how bad these movies were made yet i still sat my ass and watched every single one of them
screenjunkies I got up to 2.35 mins of staring! Time Ill never get back...

screenjunkies Adele is famous, but why isnt Susan Boyle as famous as her? She can sing better.
screenjunkies Comedy. Look it up in the dictionary Then afterwards know that anything that falls under the definition of comedy (this video) is not meant to be taken seriously.

screenjunkies George carlins dead body
screenjunkies Id want ezio from assassins creed to host the oscars
screenjunkies half of me wants these movies to do well because it sucks when you see characters and stories that you love get butchered. The other half wants 20th century fox and sony to have a series of busts so that... well, you know. I just want everyone in the same universe.

screenjunkies OMG I want to see the XForce!!! Archangel, Deadpool, Deathlok, Fantomex, Nightcrawler, Psylocke, and Wolverine!!!!! If they make a movie with them, and add the whole Hope story and Cable and The Avengers... just wow.
screenjunkies Thor, the Hulk, Spiderman, Loki, Maximum Ride and the rest of the Avengers. Just because.
screenjunkies I really think if the director really wants to make ANY of these movies to work he simply needs to not only watch the entire cartoon series of the Xmen but become passionate about them but also read the comics. They need Bishop and Cable to bring the professor back get Gene under control so they can use the Pheonixs powers, bring in Gambit, Collosses (the older version) Ice Man (older) Wolverine Cyclopes (with there comic suits) Beast and Professor X.
screenjunkies The whole XMen movie franchise is screwed up. All of the stories are cobbled together mish mashes of characters that have been thrown together for the cool factor. I grew up reading XMen comics, and every movie has been disappointing to me. So, Yeah! Days of Future Past will suck.
screenjunkies 6:10 And yet, nothing on Lady Deathstrike and her adamantium nails in X2?
screenjunkies I refuse to date a girl until shes seen Back to the Future at least once.
screenjunkies Id like to see Sarah Connor and Shovelface on a date. Shed stake him inside of 15 minutes.
screenjunkies Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Edward Cullen, before Edward met Bella. Buffy would stake him, save the day and prevent a horrible, dystopian future from ever happening.
screenjunkies 03:45 Shit just got real!
screenjunkies Snow White and the Huntsman needs to be eaten alive. The can make fun of the way Stewart awkwardly rides a horse.
screenjunkies That PeeWee Herman doll looks uncannily like you.
screenjunkies How can you not know who Peter Gabriel is?
screenjunkies Who the eff is peter gaybriel
screenjunkies Most epic Halftime show was....BEYONCE!!! Mainly for one reason.....DESTINYS CHILDS MINIREUNION!!!!
screenjunkies Did this asshole say vin diesel was a piece of shit?
screenjunkies Best Half time show already exists. Its the Kitten Half Time Show for the Puppy Bowl.
screenjunkies Half Time show  William Shatner doing a Benny Hill type performance with all the cheerleaders.. :)
screenjunkies The ultimate stare off between Kristen Stewart and Keanu Reeves...
screenjunkies Well until they are, SB36 is on top.
screenjunkies Do Breaking Dawn Parts 1 and 2!!!!
screenjunkies leavevin deisel alone!1
screenjunkies HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
screenjunkies I AM a witch! and black. how come they found the stupidest fucking witches possible to answer the dumbest questions ever? im sooooo pissed.
screenjunkies Made me think of Pinocchio Vampire Slayer comic, would like to see that as an anime or something, dont know about liveaction, pinocchio lying and staking vampires with his nose.
screenjunkies how manny children have you eaten?lol man that was great.
screenjunkies Damn that guys face looks like a rats face. I cant stop thinking of a rat every week, almost...
screenjunkies And these type of women are the reason they are never taken seriously...  Ive researched witchcraft and practiced it much of my former life, but if I go to see a film about Hansel and Gretel, I do not expect to see a portrayal of what witches may be like... I expect to see them portrayed as they would have been during the days the fairy tale was made. Which was cursing crops, eating children and generally causing havoc... Id be pissed if it didnt give that.
screenjunkies Dont mind me, just a Christian passing through.
screenjunkies So to cast a spell, all you have to do is mutter in fake Italian? Real witches. Wow.
screenjunkies I liked how she had to think about if she ate children or not. Haha
screenjunkies Harsh language is my favorite weapon against zombies.
screenjunkies this is hilarious! Love some Rob Corddry
screenjunkies He is just not funny. I hate him in just about everything hes in. Rob douche
screenjunkies Did he just say The Walking Dead was bullshit I am going to kill him
screenjunkies Ninja stars... Nuff said
screenjunkies Squeez them to death. thats how you kill a zombie.
screenjunkies 1267 Zombies Like this. Hoorah.
screenjunkies i know that now, after actually thinking about it xD
screenjunkies probably Schindlers list
screenjunkies Dragonball evolution action figures. That would be takin it to far
screenjunkies 12 years a slave must be the most offensive action figure
screenjunkies Do, Escape From, shit wrong show.
screenjunkies Monsters Ball Nude Billy Bob Thorton
screenjunkies Pulp Fiction, Marsellus and hillbilly action pack, complete with sound effects and removable clothing. Batteries and gimp not included.
screenjunkies Ill probably get harsh burns for this but I dont think the word nigger, negro, black manwoman or anything like that is offensive to say. If people are white, we refer to them as white, and no one sees a problem in that. Why is if a problem when we do it with people whos skin colour is brown of black? If theres a 100 people with the same haircut, same clothes, same height, same everything, but youre looking for your friend Steve, and hes white, and the 99 other people are brown or black or anything else, is it bad to say hes the white one? And if its the other way around, is it a bad thing to say that hes the black one? I understand that when its used as an insult, like some people do (i.e. that goddamned blackwhite guy), of course I understand that theyre offended, but its not always used as an insult. Caucasian is a race, hispanic is a race, african is a race, white is a colour, beige is a colour, brown is a colour. Why be offended by a wordcolour? Why try so hard to come up with a different word, that isnt even correct most of the times (read: people who refer to all brown people as africanamerican)? I understand why they get offended, those words are used as insults, but its time we stop using and seeing them as insults. Theyre words, theyre colours, theyre the colours of our skins, and that should in no possible way be a bad thing.
screenjunkies Se voc est se referindo a 0:46, ele fala sidekick, no psychic.
screenjunkies I really liked cloud atlas i just think it fell flat like any post matrix: the revolution wachowski film is wont to do. but imagine if it didnt fall flat hmmmmmm?
screenjunkies that guy who looks like Santa sounds flamboyantly gay.
screenjunkies twilight really gets shit on by people. and it deserves every bit of it, it sucks ass, the end.
screenjunkies I think the year the Sandra Bullock got the Best Actress Oscar, she got the Razzie for Worst Actress and accepted it. Thats awesome.
screenjunkies John Wilson reminds me of a love child between Santa Claus an Zack Galafinakis.
screenjunkies Most of the stuff I heard in this video is a load of rubbish lol
screenjunkies Oogieloves is good for what its trying to be and enjoyable to its intended audience.
screenjunkies Adam Sandler resurfaces in the 2013 RAZZIE Nominations still not surprised! lol
screenjunkies Was this the episode Hal was talking in the Easter egg episode? Whats up with the hand?
screenjunkies I thought I was gonna see Bruce Willis totter around on a zimerframe with guns on.
screenjunkies in that trailer bruce either looks extremely bored, or he wants to fuck his son, i mean look at his eyes im just imagining attempting to put the buzzcut behind the dudes ear.
screenjunkies Its actually Spartacus:Blood and Sand and Jai Courtnetys Character Varro was one of the best on the show his friendship with Spartacus was brilliant! (Watch it Guys)
screenjunkies Never attempt to recapture 80s magic.
screenjunkies He made some valid points.
screenjunkies Nick makes me laugh so much. I relate to his rage so much lol
screenjunkies Did anyone else notice he did this entire video with a fake right arm?
screenjunkies wow, i remember the whole movie, its bland. i bet you also think any of the fights in transformers was good. just because there were gun fights and explosions doesnt mean its a fun movie. diehard 4 is a fun movie. die hard 5 have one half decent car chase at the beginning, drops off for 40 min after the hotel and has a boring fight at the end, dont even get me started on the plot
screenjunkies I hate Obama and Gun Scenes you get an education. And no it proves the movie sucked. The other die hard films are gold and im a 23 year old with more wit about movies than you
screenjunkies I hate anna Kendricks face why cant anyone agree with me?
screenjunkies Wasnt that the same with Alien 3, and Alien: Resurrection? Im starting to sense a pattern.
screenjunkies Umm the Grey sucked, anyone who liked it is an idiot
screenjunkies i totally agree on Anna Kendrick, she grows on you and you get really horny.
screenjunkies Aside from HBOs Luck, which I havent seen, I dont agree with any of your statements.
screenjunkies Totally agree with you on 1.  Battleship was just as stupid at Transformers, but since it didnt have the same title, it bombed. I really liked Prometheus.
screenjunkies This guy reminds me of Kevin Sussman
screenjunkies He still had dignity when he made Pulp Fiction, but come on. Battlefield Earth, The Punisher, Hairspray, Savages?
screenjunkies Hey! Im really happy that you guys recognised Lena Dunhams body parts, after all the negative press they received.
screenjunkies pico! KkkKK Amei! Ri por uma semana!
screenjunkies ri d com o viciado em crack invisvel kkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies Faltou dizer no honest trailer algo do tipo: no era mais fcil pegar uma guia daquelas e ir voando at o vulco para destruir o anel.
screenjunkies my hump my humps ... kkkkkkkkkk ri litros
screenjunkies And Lindsay Lohan!!KKKKK
screenjunkies Pobre Sean Bean! huahhahahua
screenjunkies voces tenq entender que isso  um filme de super heroi, nada faz sentido, e nao tem nenhuma obrigaao em ter sentido....
screenjunkies haehaeahe ai ai cara muito engraado essa porra.
screenjunkies Damn i want a t shirt now
screenjunkies Im going to name my first born Hal Rudnik
screenjunkies You can sweat dude.....
screenjunkies Dude you are hilarious.
screenjunkies TNG with: Shakira as Deanna Troi (no one understands her anyway) Jim Parsons as Wesley Crusher (he can play a genius and irony never fails with fans) Helen Keller as La Forge (it just makes sense) Nicholas Cages Forhead as Worf The Situation as Riker (Why not?) James McAvoy as Picard (RIGHTFULLY SO) Kate Walsh as Bev Crusher (she knows how to play a doctor and her career is going nowhere anyways) AAAND...... Jennifer Lawrence as Data for her robotic deliveries
screenjunkies What a fantastic interview. You might have noticed how the three of them started off cold and a little annoyed. Most people get bored at press junkets very quickly. But through Rudnicks silly questions and antics you see the three celebrities let their guard down. While drinking and being goofy they reveal much more about themselves than they would have through answering a typical questionnaire. Well done screenjunkies.
screenjunkies data played by bender
screenjunkies Hahaha 2 funny! Seen this makes me wanna see this movie now!
screenjunkies Give me a shirt. right meow.
screenjunkies That got weird fast...
screenjunkies That is so fucking funny
screenjunkies Johnny Depp couldnt play the Terminator.
screenjunkies what about honest trailers?...i dont see any new uploads...
screenjunkies Johnny depp couldnt play nelson Mandela in a porno
screenjunkies It was all fine and dandy till 2:25. This is kinda disturbing, was he serious?....I would have left as soon, as soon as this guy got weird, not about that lyfe.
screenjunkies I think you need to watch The Platoon.
screenjunkies What does Elijah has to do with Hanukah?
screenjunkies Santa messed up every year........
screenjunkies Finally someone who dose not like this movie!I tried to watch it 3 times. Every time I fell to sleep.
screenjunkies but my grandma was on Shindlers list.
screenjunkies If Jews have all the money, then why ask for money? LOL
screenjunkies try to say : a huevo, its very dificult to translate but it means like oh yeah like giving your approvel to something that just happened But at the same its have other meaning, its like you had to do something against your will
screenjunkies The sandwich making breaks so many jewish rules for eating kosher.
screenjunkies Just because you have a YouTube channel entitled American Nazi Party doesnt make you a White Nationalist. I can make up any bullshit channel on this site but its what I say that counts. Any informed White person would never post a comment like your previous one. Youre clearly a Hasbarat troll. Of course you may very well be from Ireland. Jews have made a nest there too, unfortunately.
screenjunkies Do fenomeno jovem adulto que no  sobre vampiros gays kkkkkk morri de rir
screenjunkies Isso era pra ser uma brincadeira? Pois achei bem srio, e quis socar a pessoa responsavel por isso :)
screenjunkies well Ciel was sulking a lot... no Sebastian to play for you?
screenjunkies The flash fat, marios black  that asian is hot.

screenjunkies HOLY CRAP, ITS THE DREY!!!!
screenjunkies GFL  The Geek Football League.
screenjunkies I dont get it why does no one like this guy he seems ok
screenjunkies Fuck all these haters. Hal, you da man! :P
screenjunkies hahah Hal I originally subbed for honest trailers, but I love the other stuff you do now. Absolutely hilarious. And dont let the haters get at you man... OR YOU LOSE.
screenjunkies Well, I for one think people should stop acknowledging negative comments altogether, let alone making videos dedicated to them in exchange of some quick cash, because that only makes it worse.
screenjunkies but seriously his arms are hairy as fuck ... just like mine
screenjunkies I love this channel and I love the host!
screenjunkies I need to get off youtube and do homework Ive been Stalin for long enough.
screenjunkies I love this channel !
screenjunkies I feel bad for the dads.
screenjunkies Go Captain Kirk!!!!!!!! hahahaha! On another note, is this what the world has come to? Seriously, pitiful. Respect your dads you brats, theyre the ones paying for the books and the movie tickets!
screenjunkies Greatest thing to hit YouTube.
screenjunkies Im so ashamed that I knew some of this answers...
screenjunkies Im wondering how they got the dads to take part in this? Did they get bribed with free beer in the waiting room or something? Lets face it, these guys did not look like they were doing this for their daughters
screenjunkies Noooo, Its TwiTARDS! D:
screenjunkies I dont like twilight but i did hope for a happy ending and i got it :)
screenjunkies lol this was so funny! I guessed 265 only 6 off not bad not bad, or I guess so sad for actually knowing around about how far in that was....
screenjunkies Im wondering how they got the dads to take part in this? Did they get bribed with free beer in the waiting room or something? Lets face it, these guys did not look like they were doing this for their daughters
screenjunkies Luke dont kiss the girl! Its your sister!

screenjunkies Isnt that how she wrote the entire series? :)
screenjunkies Darth Vader is Lukes father?!?!?!?! SPOILER ALERT!
screenjunkies am very disapointed no yoda auditions? shame on you shame
screenjunkies This isnt pranking.....
screenjunkies Sorry SJ, this just wasnt good. These guys werent funny at all. Even their Jedi impressions sucked.
screenjunkies Buck off Cuz! in the comments!
screenjunkies The host is a bitch! He pissed off al of those people and thought it was funny?! These are really the people who make honest trailers?!
screenjunkies The host is a bitch! He pissed off al of those people and thought it was funny?! These are really the people who make honest trailers?!
screenjunkies Fire the annoying host. Hes terrible.
screenjunkies You went too overboard.
screenjunkies No idea how this video ended up with humorless subscribers. This is pretty funny. I mean its really stupid, but the reaction from the people makes it pretty funny. Fking with randoms is funny.
screenjunkies orbs lol cough cough try the reflection from the candles lol the noise who knows
screenjunkies Holy crap, I just laughed the entire way through this! Also: dude is the worst Michael Jackson lookalike I have ever seen, but he busts out the Harry Belafonte when Beetlejuice is mentioned, so hes forgiven.
screenjunkies Baron Lam it wasnt just a cat, it was Salem from Sabrina the teenage witch )
screenjunkies Now when you say no darks does that mean spirits of black people are gonna come?
screenjunkies its funny that you conjured Bill Bixby, considering in the 1976 he played a spiritualist, in The Great Houdini, that was getting a message from Harry Houdini to give to his wife Bess Houdini.
screenjunkies 1:15 Since when is Zach Galifianakis in the Screen Junkies filming crew ? x)
screenjunkies eddie is super creepy
screenjunkies theyre mice humping in the walls!!
screenjunkies I want to beat the fat and stupid off of them so badly...
screenjunkies man, making them read seemed kind of cruel
screenjunkies I use to have a hot boss. I miss her :(
screenjunkies This family is every thing wrong with Americans
screenjunkies Oh my god....I actually sat here and thought about how that would work.....gross.
screenjunkies I still have a little nausea because of that Sketti thing... god it seems awful...
screenjunkies She said she never seen any material of Christopher Walken ? Good job on living under a rock for last 30 years,
screenjunkies Ive watched a southpark episode making fun about this thing. At first i thought it was an exaggeration. After i saw this, i couldnt believe it. I bothered to watch another suggested video from the right, and im simply horrified this is an actual thing. How the hell was this allowed to reach the media in any other form other than Social services save problematic child from a disturbed parent?
screenjunkies Why oh why did I watch the end scene after eating pizza. spews
screenjunkies We are all doomed.(via Amber Thompson )
screenjunkies Christopher Walken, Colin Farrell  Sam Rockwell reading transcripts from Here Comes Honey Boo Boo? Words do not suffice. crazy sevenpsychopaths christopherwalken colinfarrell samrockwell  honeybooboo
screenjunkies Do NOT watch this if youre high.
screenjunkies uhh, best interview all DECADE!
screenjunkies Best interviewer ever
screenjunkies Im surprise that christopher walkin didnt walk out..
screenjunkies Dr. Manhathan kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

screenjunkies rapeface,dr.manhattan,gosma preta do arquivo X,benjamin button,super vagina
screenjunkies Prometheus certamente  a pior fico cientifica dos ltimos tempos...rs... tem mais furo que peneira... comeando com o cara se perder....sendo que ele mapeou tudo... e as mulheres fugindo da nave caindo....como se fossem personagens de desenho animado...rsrs
screenjunkies Sua traduo para State of the art in computer maps, eta correta O estado da arte em mapas computadorizados O cara ali de cima que te corrigiu no deve conhecer a expresso que significa o que ha de melhor em alguma coisa.
screenjunkies hahahahahhahahahaHonest Trailers  The Avengers LEGENDADO PTBR!
screenjunkies O filme deveria ter deixado isso claro.
screenjunkies Quer uma estrelinha agora?
screenjunkies Acho que iria trazer muita gente pro canal com o Honest Trailer! xD
screenjunkies Hahahahahah Starring Mace Windu Mto bom!!!
screenjunkies Your hair is awesome.
screenjunkies 414 Albanian people watched this video o.o
screenjunkies Albanians cant grow beautiful mustaches and good luck
screenjunkies Very funny Hal, good job.
screenjunkies just be really fat. no one wants to lift a big fat guy
screenjunkies I cant tell if I like this guy or hate him. Hmmmm.
screenjunkies But what if one of them is coming at you with a dildo?
screenjunkies Is that liam McIntyre??
screenjunkies GOOD LUCK ! lol check the bottom of description
screenjunkies What if Looper was made in in the 90s with the same actors, but as a family flick?
screenjunkies Pedobear has a lot to learn from Bruce Willis ....a lot to learn.
screenjunkies I cant ever see Bruce Willis as a child. He had the facehairline he has now, since he was a toddler. And Joseph is just too pretty.....of an asian girl.
screenjunkies 12 monkeys  Bruce Willis goes back in time and sees his younger self Disneys The Kid  Bruce Willis goes back in time and sees his younger self Looper  Bruce Willis goes back in time and sees his younger self WHAT IS IT WITH BRUCE WILLIS STARRING IN MOVIES WHERE HE GOES BACK IN TIME AND MEETS HIMSELF!?!?
screenjunkies Well I did not know that so you you dont have to act like a snob.
screenjunkies he was talking about the screen junkies channel and screen junkies said on the comments hello Jovem Nerd
screenjunkies Listen, man. EVERYONE wants to meet Bruce Willis, even Bruce Willis.
screenjunkies I just say what needs to be said. I like this guy.
screenjunkies I think Loki was not a good enough villain for the ALL 5 OF THE AVENGERS to be fighting. The Chitauri were pretty meh, not huge threats. The main fight was all crammed into the end and like I said Loki didnt really stand a chance versus all the Avengers so no real epic moments in the movie I have a feeling these problems will be corrected in Avengers 2 and 3.
screenjunkies Are you dead inside?best question ever! Seriously who liked Beverly Hills Chiuaha?
screenjunkies he had chicago 1s on.... Im weird.
screenjunkies Avengers: The most disappointing movie since The Last Airbender.
screenjunkies Dear Long haired DOOSH, I wouldnt expect a fuckhead like you to like this movie, you sound like you would rather stick things up your own ass, Only die hard comic book readers should see this movie.
screenjunkies The little girl Nonfiction
screenjunkies That little girl is so annoying
screenjunkies I hate the Avengers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Holy shit his face at 0:18 nearly killed me
screenjunkies Flula is the man hahaha
screenjunkies I would love to see this guy doing more interviews. Hes funny as well as clever.
screenjunkies I am watching this movie because of this interview.
screenjunkies Haha, Genius, but not in a creepsy way.
screenjunkies DJ Flula was funnier the first time when he was called Ali G.
screenjunkies I love Flula, if I was a girl, Id totally hit that, but Im not, so I wont.
screenjunkies haha this guy is awesome
screenjunkies Eric needs a shrim bath.
screenjunkies Ive been an enthusiastic mushroom taker for years, I have never seen anyone have a trip like that ...
screenjunkies Something I still havent done
screenjunkies My favorite tim in Erik moment is when they roll around in poopy in a child pool full of poop in a childrens pool all the while while singing poop song! Tim in Erik hdicker rule and rock!
screenjunkies I love how Tims moustache is beyond irony, beyond being an actual moustache... its sort of on its own. Does anyone know what I mean? Or am I talking balls?
screenjunkies All of their one movie?
screenjunkies fuck you with the starwars joke go die from a lack of oxygen
screenjunkies I cant tell if this is a sarcastic statement or if youre a six year old using a voicetotext app
screenjunkies YOURE GONNA DIE CLOWN!!!
screenjunkies whats the music at 3:03 called?
screenjunkies 3:15KHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I know its Spock who says that line. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Anyone knows the whole list of movies? Dont recognize some, which means I have movies to see. :D
screenjunkies the transformers one oh god :(
screenjunkies Sorry guys, but the background music is far too loud.  Maybe someone said that already, I didnt want scroll down the latest 5000 comments )
screenjunkies For some reason the Transformers one got me the most.
screenjunkies What movie is that at 3:22?
screenjunkies Ha this got blocked!!
GameSack Whats the point when you got two idiots in there with you pointing a radio 1 microphone in peoples face?
GameSack Lmao was funny but would of been better if a mic and camera werent stuffed in his face!
GameSack This is amazing hahahah!!
GameSack So good but the lady with the microphone and camera phone in his face ruined it..
GameSack Yeah totally not obvious it was being filmed with the lady with a huge microphone just stood there
GameSack My personal way of dealing with the 1 sack drop is to switch it up to 10. That makes me feel like its rare enough to work for, but not a hopeless drop. The devs made a bunch of LUA code changes so its simpler, I think. If anyone wants to know look for DontStarvedatascriptsprefabskrampus.lua, change krampussack, .01 to krampussack, .1.
screenjunkies Whats funny is if they HAD just used the word fuck and nothing else, the video would be longer.
screenjunkies Im pretty sure the other f word compilation would be much longer than this
screenjunkies Haha, very clever. :D
screenjunkies To be truthful, the fact of the matter is you could have wasted my time on a much better video sreenjuckies.
screenjunkies Was I just trolled by Screen Junkies?
screenjunkies And not a fck was given that day
screenjunkies and all the fucks!! there where tons of it
screenjunkies Watch Nymphomaniac with your mom
screenjunkies For the love of god. Please watch Salo (120 Days of Sodom), A Serbian Film, Antichrist, or August Underground. http:www.complex.compopculture20111010moviesyoucantunsee10
screenjunkies NICK. MAKE YOUR OWN GOD DAMN CHANNEL!!
screenjunkies Terminator 2: Judgement DayNot only an amazing movie regarding script, acting and special effects, but also for being the exception to the rule that Sequels are never as good as the original. As great as the original Terminator is, part II blew the original in twists, darkness, character development and brought us the T1000. And then they made parts 3 and 4...
screenjunkies Austin powers  the spy who shagged me
screenjunkies Lets. Talk about 80s genre shall we.
screenjunkies Well my number 1 favorite movie of all time is Lon The Professional,I love It cause of Jean Reno and Gary Goldmans performance and its Natalie Portmans first film,i ask people my age (18)if theyve heard of It and Im so disappointed in knowing they havent. Nowadays all these kids care about is if a movie is scary enough for them, they dont care about a good original story,nor even a descent script. All they care about our jump scares. You can tell a lot about people by asking them what their favorite movie is.
screenjunkies did he really just say that Forrest Gump is one of the worst movies of all time?
screenjunkies I personally loved the first gremlins movie, second one not so much but it was alright.
screenjunkies Honest Trailer of a UFC event? Might be a repeat of the Pacific Rim trailer....
screenjunkies Say  Hashtag FCK YOU TWITTER!
screenjunkies Do the Spongebob Movie.And say: Once, there was an ugly barnacle. He was so ugly that everyone died. The end.
screenjunkies Pleas say:May goose tan laws free hole eat us!
screenjunkies Pls make honest trailer for Divergent, I really love you guy by the way 3
screenjunkies great fucking trailer..fuck..
screenjunkies Say: My nipples are acting like children
screenjunkies Not just white people... thank you ahahahahhahaha
screenjunkies Nick munch is my new favorite person!
screenjunkies The best way to do things it to just redo the 80s movie in live action, shot for shot. No one will care whether or not it fits into the continuity. The original really didnt fit into continuity either.
screenjunkies I say we teach the movie industry a lesson. Everyone just wait for it to come out on Bluray or DVD and rent it from Redbox. They would make a killing and the studio would learn a lesson. Every movie doesnt need action and humor and sadness and a love story and drama. Also, its a movie it doesnt have to be filled from beginning title to end credits with constant talking. Especially if its an action movie. Action, thats all we need, TO SEE!
screenjunkies Haha so funny, great points its so true all transformers movies is the same shit. When i put on a channel and a transformers movies is on i have no idea sometimes witch one it is there all fhen same crap.
screenjunkies It all just breaks my heart. Transformers has to be one of my all time favorite series and all of the live action films for it are just terrible. I have more faith in Transformers: Rescue bots than Bay at this point.When I see TF4 I will do the same thing I did for the last one: turn of my brain as the movie plays, then when its all said and done, rage. I wish I could expect something good or different, but when you look at the previous data, thats just not gonna happen.
screenjunkies 1:00 I said the same damn thing to my pal. I dont like it trying to be funny with the transformers! unless its with the cast. and the only funny part with the cast was India the Germans girlfriend.
screenjunkies They better not F this up
screenjunkies we need unicron and Hot Rod
screenjunkies michael tnt bay has proven he cant make a good live action transformers movie. The robots look like shit. The plots are silly. Most of all the human characters ALL suck. What the fuck happened to energon cubes? Do have to be a an ass licking mason to enjoy them chasing after a mystical cube in part 1?! Why did megatron have to get frozen on earth like jetfire? Why does starscream look like an angry slice of pizza? Why does bumble bee seem a bit much like wreck gar? Wanting to see shia la douche die in this series, was just as bad enough a guilty pleasure as wanting to see john cusack die a horrific death in 2012. The best way to unfuck live action transformers movies is to base them on the idw comic or the war for cybertron games, and have James Cameron or Peter Jackson make them.
screenjunkies The Mist breaks my heart every time. :( Also why use the remake of Wicker Man? Original is much, much better.
screenjunkies What a twist!!...now which of these Honest Trailers have I not seen yet...?
screenjunkies What a twist!If you want a twist, read The Mysterious Benedict Society by Trenton Lee Stewart
screenjunkies Wow ya this is awesome
screenjunkies what is that film with mel gibson?
screenjunkies what movie was that one with Jhon Cussack looking in the mirror at some bald dude?Also, King Jofry got poisoned and died in last episode of Game of Thrones.
screenjunkies By FAR its Tyrion bitch slapping the little bitch Geoffrey.
screenjunkies I personally like storyline with Bran, lol
screenjunkies Season 4 is going to be the best season so far, its already got the strongest start, and you just wait to see all the rest that happens...
screenjunkies I know were only on episode three of season 4 but , i know my favorite episode already
screenjunkies Not watching it was my favorite part of season 3
screenjunkies Not a fan of Daenerys but JorahBarristan are like the coolest guys in the show. I got the first 3 seasons on DVD box and could watch them all in the tempo i prefered. Now that i have to watch 1 episode per week its feel like everything in the show is going so damn slow.
screenjunkies Tyrion Lannister For King. Best Story Arya Stark Hope she kills all of them. Best action big time win for me and hottest of all the boobs Daenerys Targaryen
screenjunkies I want deanerys to win the throne
screenjunkies The best Scene?I just say one word DRACARYS! is the more to say I guess not still get a gooseflesh...oh and a climax )
screenjunkies i like how you say boobs
screenjunkies Honestly I cant remember a lot of the names as well. Haha. So majy characters!
screenjunkies What is the song from 37 sec onwards called?
screenjunkies Lord Friend Zone!! hahahaha
screenjunkies SPOILERS:Beewwwwwbs.........and also for the rest of the books...........
screenjunkies Please say: With great power, comes great responsibility. :)
screenjunkies Game of thrones, its kind of like a historytest. But with dragons, and Bewbs.
screenjunkies 4:14 Hal looks like german propaganda
screenjunkies i automatically hate it because michael bay throughout his entire career as a filmmaker he has only made one good movie and that was armageddon which the soundtrack for was shit
screenjunkies Im just gonna wait it out and see how the movie goes........freaking Michel Bay
screenjunkies didnt mention the fact that the bros look like shrek
screenjunkies I am the eternal optimist I think its going to kick butt. I must say that What i have seen of what the turtles look like is so totally awesome. No one knows what it will be like until its out and we see it for our selves. So lets just wait it out and have fun no matter what all I can say is I grew up on them and i am not one bit disappointed. We will see what happens with this new franchise I can see it going very far. Kowabunga!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies One question on my mind is, why the fuck is one of the turtles giant like and destroying the city.
screenjunkies The archie TMNT series was mad cool...time travel, samurai roots, environmentalism...too bad it was cut short by, like all good things, lack of sales
screenjunkies 1. Megan Fox is NOTHING like April ONeil.2. Michael Bay probably wants to pork her still so that why he hired her.3. The turtles arent even teenagers, they clearly have adult voices.4.Although the movie looks good, to me I just imagine a turtle in a ninja costume with explosions around it. basically like any Michael Bay film (minus the turtle).5. Hell mess it up with his shit script writers.
screenjunkies I thought the trailer looked okish, but I dont like the new look they gave the turtles. Sure, you can change a couple of things on the way they look and dress, but in this case its kind of ugly. I really didnt get excited when I saw the trailer because I got excited for Transformers and it didnt stand up to my expectations, leaving me very skeptical with these kind of movies. And I dont like the idea of having Megan Fox as April, she aint the April we want.
screenjunkies B. black widowI. iron manT. thorC. captain AmericaH. hulk
screenjunkies Do the winter soldier when you can.
screenjunkies Rober Downey Sr. Hahahaha xD
screenjunkies captain america the winter soldier
screenjunkies DO WINTER SOLDIER!!!!!!! PLEASE, (and focus a bit on Bucky please!!!!!!!!!)thnx
screenjunkies I dont get why they didnt get a bodybuilder instead of Mr. Pipsqueak.And dont tell me they went Disney of the movie and said they did it because he was the only one that had the heart to do it.
screenjunkies He should have said The 90 Year Old Who Is Kinda Hot Actually.
screenjunkies Scenes that disturbed me:Pinocchio turning into donkeySe7en pretty much any sceneMidnight express tongue ripping outThe Matrix neo getting bugged
screenjunkies A Clockwork Orange is up there when he rapes the woman while singing.
screenjunkies The evil dead tree rape scene and pretty much any scene in a clockwork Orange.
screenjunkies Fk u dude. Its 340 am now I am not gonna sleep
screenjunkies Plague Dogs when the farmer shoots himself in the face.
screenjunkies can anyone give the movie list?
screenjunkies Any scene from the film Grotesque. Or the diarrhoea scene in Human Centipede 2, just the look on his face when he realizes the laxative s are working.
screenjunkies Knife stabbing scene in Saving Private Ryan has always bothered me more than just about any other messed up movie scene Ive seen.
screenjunkies TETSUO the iron man, bit in the scene both merge together, his cock turns into a massive drill whilst fuckin his wife cutting her to shreds, and that scene also has flashing scenes of him being raped by a woman with a Hoover sucking ou his organsI RECOMEND everyone to see it
screenjunkies A Serbian Film: The whole damn movie.
screenjunkies most of these deaths are BS. Ive seen people hit in the same way in RL and they dont get rip fractors or insta death from a bottle to the head.
screenjunkies Honest Actio: Rush Hour  all

screenjunkies The resident evil movies were pretty decent
screenjunkies Any one of the Assassins Creed games
screenjunkies i am just sitting here waiting for hollywood to make the first pokemon movie. not the animated one
screenjunkies HALFLIFE!!!!!! WOULD BE AWESOME OR CALL OF DUTY 1 OR 2
screenjunkies just for record i love wreckitralph best video game movie ive seen but i rather see a new mario movie but with a different story, new plot points new main character with mario and luigi and make a saga of the mario bros. not the 1993 movie that just killed my childhood it kills it just saying as a fan in videogames
screenjunkies Would love Heavy Rain as a film, absolutely clever script and I think it could be done really cleverly with people not knowing the killer until the end (unless youve played the video game) Could be the next Se7en...
screenjunkies And the composer of hasa diga eebowai HAHAHAHA. If you dont get it, find the song and listen to it
screenjunkies Tangled you can come up with lots of things with her hair no matter now god a movie Jayda Morgan
screenjunkies Im Pissing Myself Laughing

screenjunkies I need a full version of Get It Out...
screenjunkies The girl singing is not so good
screenjunkies say: why do all the amazing people in movies either turn evil or die?! It hurts my tiny heart so bad that i wanna cry in my pillow for more than forever

screenjunkies Everything they say about Peeta is true I just love it omfg
screenjunkies Jack Bauers Dad  I died
screenjunkies I would like to see Jennifer Lawrence host xD
screenjunkies Hugh Laurie or Stanley Tucci should host
screenjunkies Good candidates for next host: Bob Hope with his comments about TV, Roger Ebert with his ability to be nice about almost any movie or whichever super star director doesnt release a movie in 2014 (because heshe was working on one being released in 2015).
screenjunkies morgan freeman should host
screenjunkies Nicolas cage should host next years event
screenjunkies Say:I love Chowtime Forevz Man I love The HUNGER GAMES AND ME THE TALKING STICK!LOLhahaha
screenjunkies Stephen Hawking should host the oscars next year. At least hes interesting.
screenjunkies are you even mean bro
screenjunkies Those Arnie commercials are disturbing.
screenjunkies Id send you and not allow you to access youtube again
screenjunkies should be remaned Celebrity Japan Commercials :P
screenjunkies George Clooney and Matt Damon are making Nespresso Commercials, we Swedes are picky xD
screenjunkies Hi nice video please also have a look at my channel too thanks
screenjunkies want to see tom bergeron as the villian in the leonardo di caprio commercial.
screenjunkies Tom hiddleston doing one of those dos equios beer commercials. I want him to be sitting on a blue satin couch and also have him wear his blue suit her wore to the Cannes festival. And he will be really hot when he says stay thirsty my friends
screenjunkies i think you are totally forgetting about Tommy Lee Jones he endorses the Boss brand coffee in japan... go check it out the vid Tommy Lee Jones Teacher Japanese Coffee Ad
screenjunkies What is wrong with those Japanese?
screenjunkies Its raining Spartans!Hallelujah!
screenjunkies Do an honest trailer for Django Unchained. Lol.
screenjunkies the homo erotic undertones section was hilarious, laughed at every clip.
screenjunkies Do Django Unchained. That movie is confusing
screenjunkies From the... Scottish part of Greece?Hahahahahaha
screenjunkies You eat like SPARTAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!:))))
screenjunkies Yeah and these two flutes is one flute and we greek people write it aulos but the pronounciation is avlos
screenjunkies I wish youd implement the following part into this episode:A movie that for the 10,000,000th time reinforces the fact that Hollywood has no idea how to do any foreign accent besides British.
screenjunkies This has to connect to Thanos because Drax the destroyer only got his name because he wants to kill Thanos.
screenjunkies Right up front about the whole Shia debacle. I wonder if they lost any subs over that, cuz it was super douchey. Not quite Shia levels of douchey, but still.
screenjunkies I want a pet rocket...
screenjunkies I think if it wasnt a marvel movie, I would like it better. But just the fact that marvel is stooping this low, seems like they are getting desperate and scraping the bottom of the barrel, when they have so many other better characters they could make movies of seems kind of stupid.
screenjunkies I like that fact ol dude got the black toe 1s on
screenjunkies Please do am honest trailer on this
screenjunkies Looks cool. But I cant wait till Infinity Gauntlet comes out. I will ejaculate on Thanos mighty chest as he fist me with his ginormous hand. JINKIES
screenjunkies So you ripped off Totalbiscuits WTF is... series. Hopefully youll receive a copyright infringement strike for that.
screenjunkies If you couldnt breathe, then you wouldnt be able to talk.  I cant breathe, well bitch you are wasting valuable breath trying to talk.stfu
screenjunkies Gravity sucked so hard haha xD
screenjunkies The very beginning is my exact reaction right after watching this movie.
screenjunkies Major fucking spoilers.
screenjunkies Were the Russians really retarded enough to fire a missile at a satellite in a weightless environment?
screenjunkies Doooo 12 yearssss a slavveeee!!!! Comeeee onnn guys !
screenjunkies shia laboeufing :D XD
retrogametech Great console I had one of these a good game to get for is is called spike
retrogametech What kind of aching simpleton sells something as faulty without checking the plug? The same sort of field sleeping, tree dwelling, dullard, that just lost a Vectrex for 30 notes. Good God!
retrogametech Try an Atari controller
retrogametech Keep us updated on what happens with this! Controller and games wise!
retrogametech Great find! Wouldnt it be possible to just rewire the extension cord to get other controllers to work instead of directly modifying one? Just a thought, it may not be that easy of a mod or you may have already considered it, but I thought Id suggest it :)
retrogametech Nice vid and a great score. Still, I would not be plugging in 30 year old hardware (especially highvoltage CRT stuff) into the mains without opening it up and inspecting the internals first. You never know what condition the electronics are in after all these years and theres the possibility of permanently damaging something.
retrogametech Theres a couple of videos on Ashens channel about the Vectrex, so that would be a good place to get clued up on what it was and some of the games you can get for it. Wow, hard to believe it was such a simple fix to get it up and running again! Well done!
retrogametech This is awesome. Find it funny that this system was 6 years before I was born so theres my excuse for having never heard of it.
retrogametech Another great reminder that when it comes to troubleshooting  if you hear hoofbeats, think horses and not zebras.
retrogametech Cool video. Ill have to see if I can find them in the US.
retrogametech Thats metal sonic from sonic cd
retrogametech I buy my gachas for four hundred yen. Really good quality!
retrogametech Poundland? Never wouldve expected
retrogametech Could you tell me where exactly u got them from?? Pls..
retrogametech I had a GBA MoviePlayer... you could flash alternate firmware on it to play homebrew before flashcarts existed.
retrogametech Awesome to see youre back making vids man, I really enjoy them.
retrogametech Happy New Year to you Martin. Good to hear from you!Keep making videos...YouTube will more than likely change to something even NEWER AND BETTER..soon enough....lol
retrogametech With the direction things have taken considering countless DLCs, releasing unfinished games, have to pay for online services it makes me miss the good old days when you tossed a game in and had fun. I dont have anywhere near the collection you do but I do have most of the older systems I grew up on starting with intellivision and Atari Great channel I enjoying seeing all of the different systems
retrogametech Nice to see you back Martin. :)
retrogametech Found and got it! For 25 US dollars or 15 british pounds!!! Didnt get the charger but I got a great deal!
retrogametech Welcome back! Also nice shoelace pattern.
retrogametech Glad to see you again,I was wondering if you could do your own version of a nintoaster tutorial
retrogametech Welcome back. Look forward to what youve got to share in the future!
retrogametech Awesome, I wana get one now man! Great stuff man
retrogametech Thanks for sharing this! Does anyone know which and where can I buy a devices that I can use to backup GB, GBC, and GBA saves, so that I can change the battery and dump them inside of them again? I cant find any with a good price tag that ship to Europe (Malta)
retrogametech When are u gonna make a new vid?
retrogametech anyone know where i can buy one of these fuckers?
retrogametech Dude almost a month without a video I need my retro fix )
retrogametech I always check to see if youve uploaded something on my break at work and found this has just gone up! Its about the GBA, too, Fantastic!
retrogametech Where do you get an ezflash cart?!
retrogametech http:www.emuzone.netgbaspgbaflashcards.htm try this site. they seem to have pictures and links to more than a dozen software and hardware combos.
retrogametech I think I might have found something:http:mynewdata.tripod.comsoftware.htmXlinker V4.0 looks like it might be worth a shot.
retrogametech http:filetrip.netndsdownloadsflashcartfilesdownloadewinclient072f3383.htmlhere is the client for the smart card, it also contains the driver as well
retrogametech You might to find info about EZFlash IIIt uses exactly the same software compared to what you have there.I have a EZFlash II myself, my research (and action) showed me that the dated software DOES NOT work with Windows Vista and up.Use Windows XP or less, and the computer recognizes the hardware (and within the program).It is a pain to load on it, but once games are inside, they load and play exactly as if it is an original gamecart.I hope this helps you out, need more help I could try to find out more.PS..: protip, sometimes through Archive.org old sites can be accessed (including their links to software) in the catacombs of the internet P
retrogametech Have you tried GBWriter? Going way way way down the google rabbithole I found an old post in Polish that says that the EZ Flash Advance II and the Smart Card II (which this is) are the same cartridge and use GBWriter. At the time, the software for this came on a minicd in a separate package that had to be bought separately(!), I found a photo of it, not that thats any use.
retrogametech wait i found it this is the site to buy it from http:www.goodylands.comG13a1.html it says you can download the driver from there site
retrogametech The back of strider 2 has korean on it im learning it :)
retrogametech The language was koreanm
retrogametech Thats korean on the back of strider 2
retrogametech I have a multi cart for the Game Boy Advance. My one is 118 in 1.
retrogametech I have the lilo and stitch 2 game and never played it but i will now. I love metal slug and the lilo and stitch games look great.
retrogametech Its definitely worth a lookdownload :)
retrogametech grate vids dude keep them up :D
retrogametech Finally a new video :D
retrogametech That top hidden gems sounds like a great idea!
retrogametech The games I enjoy collecting are those 32 in one pirate carts. Prices of carts take the pss.
retrogametech awesome vidoes would like to see how your devices (cart gamesemulators) are setup!
retrogametech Really liked how you did video on the side for gameplay,I hope you keep doing it.
retrogametech i want to know how you keep it so dust free xd
retrogametech Do a controller collection
retrogametech You can get a kinect lens adapter that clips on to shorten its range!! http:www.amazon.co.ukNykoZoomRangeReductionLensdpB0050SYS5A
retrogametech It was done several years ago but I think it was Plasticoat or something similar.
retrogametech Same here. Id seen a thread over on HUKD and got it from John Lewis with a 5 year guarantee :) . Great TV! I appreciate you watching!
retrogametech Didnt you pick up an N64 not too long ago? Or did I just imagining this? Well it seems Deus Ex is a must play :) . Lots of people praising it so I think Ill get started on that later. I didnt know youd played the first ME. If you thought the first one was even half decent then youll really enjoy the second. Personally I think it might be one of the greatest video games ever made (no joke).
retrogametech Well, it had a great life. It still works, but we have flat screens now. Its been in loads of spots, the front room, the bedroom, the office, the bedroom again, then the office again. Its getting on the fragile side. It was a fantastic telly, but we dont use it. :(
retrogametech One of them is just a preorder bonus lenticular box  poster.
retrogametech DC beermats, how random! 3 very interesting pieces here RGT. :)
retrogametech Bright pink, just as I remember it ingame ) :D
retrogametech You should make a vid and post it on Eds vid! :)
retrogametech Dream Eye!!! Hmmm Heres me thinking the Playstation Eye was a clever name, turns out Sega was there first....
retrogametech The older I get the more I realize that the Dreamcast was way ahead of the curve on certain things. And my wife has the pink lancer as well , when we went to comic con Carlos Ferro ( the voice of Dom in gears of war series) signed the blade.
retrogametech Damn I really want one of these! They dont ship to US tho! That samurai shodown game looks awesome.
retrogametech 8:20 Same voice actor as Link?
retrogametech would it be possiable to get the sellars ebay name? i cant find the relevant listings lol
retrogametech Id love one but lack of space and money mean its not possible for now. In future maybe.
retrogametech Sorry to bother you Im italian and I have an old nes pal with two control pads and a zapper. Unfortunately only one pad functions. The other connects to the console but if I press start the game doesnt do anything. It comes with some games that i dont use anymore too. Im going to sell it for a reasonable price and I wondered if you were intrested in it. thanks in advance
retrogametech Its easyleisuresales. 6 left in stock on .co.uk. Ships to Europe only.
retrogametech I like how the auction posting turned into a big political rant at the end.
retrogametech The high pitched noise is the CRT and is only audible to people under a certain age. I cant hear a thing :P
retrogametech Been watching videos for a long time! Always good some older tech from my childhood. Please subscribe to my channel when you can:)
retrogametech Always an interesting time watching your videos and seeing how you fault test.
retrogametech haha, was thinking GamerRage from the start, they seem nice controllers, i love my Ghost Recon Future Soldier controller, doesnt have the new Style DPAD though, nice one
retrogametech Search Tac Switch on google, you will find buttons very close to what he has
retrogametech I need to get all my damned internet issues sorted I miss watching this channel. Especially the videos of this nature.
retrogametech i love mechanical keyboards because i can clean them in much the same way you clean off the controller in this vid: pop off the keys, dump em in the sink great video as always
retrogametech Sorry, none spare at the moment.
retrogametech I have like Xbox controllers that are broken. How do I fix them???
retrogametech what camera do you use?
retrogametech Please do more videos you do like 1 a month
retrogametech Ive got one of those. Its really cool cause of the region switch.
retrogametech does the clone actually work with a 32X
retrogametech i like the look of those things.. v cool. shame its not a true chip set clone.. that would be sweet.. with built in multi region etc
retrogametech By the way thanks for your video. very interesting
retrogametech I actually like the Color Scheme
retrogametech Were the ribbon cables simply hot glued in place?? :
retrogametech Its getting to be quite the annoying glitch now. Ive missed out on loads of peoples videos I subbed to recently .
retrogametech Do you make gaming videos im a big fan of your channel
retrogametech haha, Thanks. Personally I cant stand it.
retrogametech using a computer with an atom processor... how do you survive?
retrogametech maybe you can use the Sky case to consolize that MVS project
retrogametech I dont mind the art style, theyre just boring as all fuck. I dont want to repeat the same stage 1,000 times because I keep dying either. Platformers in general have never been my thing.
retrogametech Its not VGA. Its rs232 c
retrogametech Can you use the hardrive in a ps3 or as a backup to a ps3 as I have three of these boxes. Didnt know I could do this. Where can I get one of them shark thingy me bobs
retrogametech I thought it was illegal in the UK to dumpster dive?
retrogametech Well it kinda is just a simplfied PC. It runs its own OS, has most of the common inputs and outputs etc
retrogametech 500gb Seagate Hard Drives sitting in those Sky boxes :D Thats how my PC has got 2 of them in it. 1tb of extra storage, For free :D
retrogametech Cheers dude! I agree about spines. They just look nicer with the art. I dont know how you guys in Australia cope with the crazy pricing of some games. Do you import much stuff yourself?
retrogametech Do you have a Gameboy Advance Micro? Could you do a disassembly of it? as i cant find any on Youtube
retrogametech RetroGameTech there is a RARE JAPANESE PSX CONSOLE FOR SALE ON EBAY LINK: ebay.comitmSONYPSXDESR7000CONSOLE250GBHDDRecorderPlayStation2XPS2JapanGameRare171087135857 CHECK IT OUT THE CONSOLE IS RARE.
retrogametech My local game in Irvine was doing the same deal and i managed to pick up dmc and final fantasy 12 for 99p and a ps2 slim for 10
retrogametech ICO is actually the prequel to Shadow of the Colossus.
retrogametech Its for GBC not GBA. But yes, although only to and from the flashcart, not other games. The USB version has all the programming hardware directly on the cartridge along with a USB port on the top.
retrogametech dont think ive ever seen a yellow OG gamboy before.. i left a pikachu themed gameboy colour at a shop for 7 quid, cos it had the wrong battery cover.. probably should have picked it up tho.. doh! i had one of the first gen tamagochi eggs.. a white and blue one.. i thought it was fucking amazing at the time.. blew my tiny little mind, so it did. lol
retrogametech Thanks, man! Youre the reason I got my GB Advance SP! Keep up the good work!
retrogametech Dammit the Pokemon Mini is so awesome though! Get a working one and do the backlight mod on it!
retrogametech Very cool find indeed.
retrogametech I prefer not to advertise it, sorry. In the past Ive had lots of problems with people sabotaging auctions and generally harassing me. As a seller, I now keep away from ebay as much as possible. I also keep my username as private as possible.
retrogametech Does anyone have any idea if AGS101 exists in Japan? I cant find any here. I have a couple of famicom color SPs but they are front lit. Front lit screens SPs are a nice upgrade from the regular GBAs but compared to a back lit screen, it looks pretty terrible because the colors look so faded.
retrogametech Its not rare at all unless it has the AGS101 model number on the back.
retrogametech I had one of these and I gave it to my little cousin.... Ima go run to his house and take it back (x
retrogametech What kind of flat screen is that where 4:3 is available?
retrogametech I was like that isent damaged oh  it is
retrogametech Im not entirely sure but I think the standard Unibios has a lot more features over the debug. The features of each should be listed on the website.
retrogametech Nice. Interesting that the system had sound issues from that one pin as the last 2pins are ground pins in both sides and it should have had some sound but none the less the bios does take time to replace traces, did that once lol. The reason why one neo needed all those parts is because it was a 5v model which is missing components but will only run on 5v although you can modify them to work on 9v, Ive done that with quite a few but some people really love the 5v models for MS X MVS on on 5v
retrogametech nice work dude. yea, its surprising it didnt fetch more, but nice to see you do the auction, i prefer that method, to give buyers a chance at a bargain. with an AES, theres such expense involved with the game collecting, i guess there arent that many who are battling to get the machines in the first place.. maybe. or i could be talkin bollocks. lol
retrogametech Typically an AES in working condition, no damage with all the bits, unboxed, sells upwards of 150. Boxed with some games and youre talking 250300
retrogametech I try it tomorrow lucky for me I got a gameboy color game maybe it could work for sega game gear game too.
retrogametech Martin have u being getting my pms as msg u a few times
retrogametech You own 2 copies of Shantae?
retrogametech Thats an interesting accent you have there. What part of England are you from?
retrogametech if you hold down select while selecting the game it will make the screen smaller sorting out the image problems
retrogametech Cool! The game also looks like a good one. :)
retrogametech Not sure if youre trolling me but Im Scottish.
retrogametech Haha, thats great! Another WayForward fan because of me. :D They make some really amazing games. Thanks for watching and supporting the channel! :)
retrogametech If youre asking whether or not the Virtual Console rerelease of Shantae is the GBA enhanced version, then sadly the answer is no. The only way to experience the game in its full original form is still to find an original cart (or flashcart P) and play it on a GBA. Reading a recent interview with Matt Bozon, I think it was possibly done intentionally to maintain the original releases desirability and value.
retrogametech worth a try dude. great vid!
retrogametech What is that high pitched background sound in this video? It drives me nuts.
retrogametech Great video Martin. Thinking the same about the sync. but the freezing shouldnt happen... Wonder if maybe the clock speeds arent matching up. Are the crystalsoscillators rated at the same speed Orig. MD  Scorpion)? Btw, (must have missed..)...what Country is the Scorpion from?
retrogametech Hey Martin. Cool little project mate. Have you tries to build a sync stripperseparator like the one built with the LM1881 like the one on mmmonkeys website?. That might get the the image to stabilise.
retrogametech good effort mate. never mind eh? have you come across anyone else on the internet whos tried to do this to a scorpion?
retrogametech Close but not quite there. I bet it was quite fun to hack around in any case :)
retrogametech why blend it if u cant make it smaller and why not blend sega cd uee just rewand all that make it hand hend or it a waste
retrogametech is it just me, or is there a horrible high pitch noise during the video??? great vid by the way
retrogametech Hey Martin, I just started collecting the more obscure games or hidden gems for the ps3 and because I took your advice on a few of your hidden gem wii games I was wondering if you were collecting at all for the ps3? There are some games that are less known and great games. Thanks!
retrogametech Over here cheapest games i can find are 9,99  or sometimes 4,99  (If its sport game or game for 5 year old kids)
retrogametech Yeah, I live in Braizil too. Everything is expensive as fuck, and electronics even more.
retrogametech The sims castaway, it is honestly such a great game!
retrogametech Wii party, muramasa, and definitively super smash brothers brawl!!
retrogametech So Ive heard. It seems to be very highly regarded.
retrogametech Well unless your going to pick up the vita version, You totally need Muramasa The Demon Blade
retrogametech Metal Slug Anthology is great. No More Heroes is fun, Mad World is great. Zak  Wiki is a good puzzler, Tatsunoko Vs Capcom is an amazing fighter, House Of the Dead Overkill is hilarious and brilliant.
retrogametech A definite hidden gen is Mario Football, you could definately lose a few hours to that one! I would also obviously recommend Zelda Twlight Princess  Im not a massive fan of Zelda at all, but bloody hell is Twlight Princess a good game! Its starts a bit slow, but by the end youll be stunned and left breathless! The game seriously stands on its own two legs.
retrogametech Which HMV did you find this in Martin? Wouldnt mind trying this out myself.
retrogametech Well you know what I mean.
retrogametech Yeah I think it used a compact flash card, he showed me it connected to his original model DS. Hed got one early, imported a Japanese DS. It must have made an impression, as I ordered a Japanese DS from a UK ebay seller a couple of weeks later. I ended up getting a DS lite later, but I traded that in against my 3DS and I still own my original chunky Japanese system :) Those were the good olf days when Nintendo were still releasing region free handhelds...
retrogametech Ive seen those on ebay. They use the big old flash memory cards if I recall?
retrogametech I remember wanting this with a Micro back in the day. Until the iPod Nano came out.
retrogametech never seen this before.
retrogametech Can the 3ds play movies?
retrogametech Was that one of the ones that also play videos? Sometimes they sell quite well on ebay.
retrogametech It would be cool if they made this for the original gameboy
retrogametech SE93 is pin and function compatible VDP to original chip. SE94 is the IO and bus management chip, also pin and funciton compatible with real Sega chip found in later MD1 boards.The Oscillator is NTSC based which is why its not exactly the same.These superclones are total awesome !
retrogametech Magic2 means there was a Magic1 clone of the Sega Master System or just the first revision of the Genesis clone? This was very cool, Ive never seen this before.
retrogametech Yeah it would be nice to find one with the second slot.
retrogametech Thanks for watching! Yeah Bad Influence was great :)
retrogametech I think it looks kinda cool too! But thats just me :P
retrogametech I used to love bad infulence I also used to rush home from school I used to like the guy namrood who did the cheats lol stuck then on his head firtlers lol
retrogametech If you like 1:1 clones check out the gb boy colour console, its a gameboycolor system that plays exactly like a proper gameboy but with a proper lit up lcd screen. i did a review on one
retrogametech Cool video! My genesis model 1 has cxa1145p video encoder so you should get rgb. However I wouldnt suggest it because when I modded mine for s video it had lined artifacts that wouldnt go away. When I modded my model 2 with a Fujitsu encoder the lines werent there.
retrogametech Nice video. Ive wanted one of these for years. (Yes, Bad Influence). But Im generally obsessed with clones and knock offs. Must have about 20 Famiclones alone.
retrogametech Once theyre fully reworked and cleaned up theyll definitely be worth a little more than what I paid for them, thats for sure! :P
retrogametech How ridiculous was that?! What an amazing bargain, youll make a pretty penny out of those, I kind of ignored my AES after picking up most of the cheap games, MVS is so much more convenient :) As always, an impressive video of your skills :D
retrogametech I just got lucky... again :P. On closer inspection that UniBios console will actually need a fair amount of reworking to put 100 right. But the other console with the bad PSU just needs one component replaced! :) Do you know exactly whats wrong with yours? Does it turn on at all?
retrogametech Thanks. Just luck :P. I still need to put a few hours work into each console to get them 100. Otherwise Im pretty happy :)
retrogametech Can anyone please tell me why there seems to be an LCD display built in to the front of his Xbox?
retrogametech I went to the pawn shops today, all offered 10 with controller and cables. They sell them for 60 : so Ill sell them on eBay Ill still come out on top anyway since I paid 23 for both :) Then after that if I cant sell both, I have some parts machines, so no biggie. Im not on many sites actually, is XS  XtremeSystems? If so Ive never been a member there.
retrogametech Very well done, hope the profit on them helps you with other projects, or something boring like bills )
retrogametech I thought the same :P . I really only bought them for the parts and that UniBios chip to put in my MVS. I was surprised it went for such a low bid. Even more surprised the consoles arent completely dead! :P Win some lose some I guess :)
retrogametech I think scan lines have an unexplainable charm to them. I guess its the retro look, I dont know, but they make everything look better in my eyes lol.
retrogametech Who says you cant? :P
retrogametech ArcadeForge for the SLG and ebay for the scaler. What system to collect for is really down to what you enjoy playing. Theres not much point in buyingcollecting stuff simply for the sake of it. Personally Id just buy the games that interest you. Softmodding a Wii allows you to run homebrew, emulators and play your games from an external HDD without needing the disc.
retrogametech 480p is Standard Res and 240p is Low res. 720p is Hi res 1080p is Hi Definition 2k is Hidefinition 4k is UHD 8k is UHD. Shhhh...
retrogametech What was that game in the Dreamcast? I wonder if its something I would be interested in. Anyway, this was a cool little home project. I hope to do something like this myself when I finally have my own place.
retrogametech DoA 2 Japanese limited edition :). Awesome game!
retrogametech On the original Wii, its easy, you just install the Homebrew Channel(If you do it right, and dont install BootMii(Which bricks your Wii), it has no drawbacks, but adds a bunch of positives). On the Wii U, Im not sure if there is any way to install any Homebrew yet. Im sure a way will be found eventually, though(If there isnt already). :)
retrogametech Why are the scan lines good?
retrogametech How do you get a sega genesis emulator on the wii u?
retrogametech Great deal on the 360 and the controllers, if the nephews get bored of ODST you could picked them up a copy of Crackdown andor Crackdown 2. Great games to play coop.
retrogametech Can I ask, where do you get those brackets you use to mount things under the desk? Been hunting for these from BQ as they would be ideal for me to mount things under shelfs etc but they dont seem to have those long ones you have??? Cheers
retrogametech Get a cheap scaler off ebay and plug in a SLG. Its like a completely different console! :)
retrogametech Ah well nice to know :) I have been a fan of your videos for a while now. First one I saw was a couple of years ago on the wiring on your jtag. Keep up the good work :P
retrogametech PS4 ,,,,or,,,, Xbox one?
retrogametech Its an HDDVD player. Its an old format used to store movies in high definition. Years ago there was a struggle between HDDVDVideo and BDVideo format for conquest the new HD home video market. Sony won the battle mainly thanks to the PlayStation 3 and its integrated Blu Ray Disc drive, and Toshiba, Microsoft and the others companies on the HDDVD side stopped the production and switch to BD.
retrogametech Hi Martin, great vid as always. Quick question. What are the model numbers of the component to vga scaler and the scan line generator so I can buy one? I have a scaler made by Mayflash but the output is crap.
retrogametech Id love to see a DOA collection video, as well as GBA and Ngage stuff. I totally get the lack of motivation thing. You can try getting around it by arguing with yourself and hopefully wind up convincing yourself to make a video :P.
retrogametech Can you do a video showing everything you have faming related
retrogametech Damn, i wished i had such an Ability to repair broken stuff like you..
retrogametech Whats going on martin. Hope your ik not seen any vids for a while. Hopefully your ok mate.
retrogametech Thats some good work. Fair play. Always good to watch.
retrogametech I havent had the time to check out the Super Cobra board yet, but I did try to degauss the monitor with an electric drill. It helped with the picture, but was not totally successful. I gave my MAME PC to a friend after his computer died, so that is on hold until he can afford to replace it.
retrogametech Good lord get the funk on with that BG music!
retrogametech I have a Marshall Amp that has a bad PCB like this, thanks for the tips. Hopefully I can repair it )
retrogametech Its probably a dodgy PSU. Pretty easy to replace :)
retrogametech I got to fix my Genesis after watching this. The sound works, but there is no video. I also have the 32x and Sega CD.
retrogametech Excellent job on the repair Martin! well impressed :)
retrogametech It kinda is the trickiest part on the controller to clean and rebuild but its really pretty easy :P . Thanks for watching and commenting! :)
retrogametech I miss my Neo Geo CDZ....
retrogametech good to know in case mine ever breaks
retrogametech what did you search to find this
retrogametech Although I will never own one of these controllers I still find it entertaining watching you fix it. Looking forward to more repair videos
retrogametech You have good taste in controllers and PC monitors. You should put the new smaller microswitches inside the hollowed out proprietary switches )
retrogametech Excellent repair Martin!! I love to see something broken Fixed, theres just something special about it. Cheers Martin
retrogametech Thanks. Ebay deals are mostly just luck and knowing when to look :P
retrogametech Awesome cover! However, even though its not the way it should be, wouldnt it be cooler if you inverted the colors of the barcode on the back of the color? Black background with white stripes? And... please make more of these covers?
retrogametech damn it looks so legit. what printer do you use? ive wanted to print a few gba covers and a gameboy player disc custom cover
retrogametech Thanks for inspiring. I decided to make my own version for the Genesis. Check it out at my Deviant site: JoeyV104
retrogametech I know you can buy the disc version for PC but a console release would be awesome. Preferably Mega Drive ).
retrogametech my suggestion? copy the dlc onto a usb memory stick formated by the xbox and stick it in there with a nice label on it. a cf card would look better but eh you cant use them with an xbox
retrogametech Talk about a missed promotional opportunity. Id pay extra money just to get a code in a box like that
retrogametech Brilliant stuff, i printed this out and made one myself earlier. Showed it off in my latest video. youl have to let me know if you ever do more as you did a bloody fantastic job!
retrogametech Thats awesome man. They released a hard copy of it on PC here in Australia. I must say im loving both the game and the soundtrack.
retrogametech With this modem, you can call at 1990
retrogametech 7:33 anyone notice he typed boobies LOL
retrogametech Wow, thats the most stuff Ive ever seen plugged into Genesis as one time!
retrogametech Great video Martin! Didnt know they had a modem for the Mega Drive  have you ever heard about the Satellaview for the old Super Famicom? Really interesting way that Nintendo provided a sort of DLC for subscribers, the service ran until about 2000.
retrogametech Damn that genesis is getting gang banged in literally every port at once.
retrogametech I wonder how hard it would be to code an emulation for these modems. Would love to experience it, or maybe even do the hardware mods to make it work on our phone lines.
retrogametech I want one of these but Im not sure why lol Probably just to check out its insides :)
retrogametech basically a sega genesis could go online? wow
retrogametech Thats a can of worms Im staying well clear of! coughcoughWiiUcoughcough :P
retrogametech Indeed, I was gonna say that the tv is too small for the scanlines to be visible but faginrs beat me to it. You shouldnt really be LOOKING for scanlines on a display screen rather than the actual visible effect the 15khz signal gives which you are getting perfectly fine on that tiny screen of yours )
retrogametech Hey, I have got exactly the same Little guy. :)
retrogametech Ive got one of these tvs. it was my mums bedroom telly, she never used it so its like brand new. The picture quality on it is so so sharp and clear it blows my 14 pvm away for clarity. The scanline issue (lack of) confuses me too. Ive tried pal and ntsc consoles and no lines. But its a great tv for retro like you say. Cheers for the service menu tip. Ill try it and see how much tube times been used, Id be amazed if its over 300 hours.
retrogametech Only because you usually cant give them away these days. Most people just want CRTs out of their house!
retrogametech Interesting stuff. I didnt know that. Maybe building your own cables would be cheaper?
retrogametech Youre totally correct! You definitely still dont get it, lol :P Most TVs have 2 SCART sockets on the back as well as all those other inputs you mention. This TV even has 2 composite inputs on the front if youre crazy enough to want to use them. And you could buy a switcher if you need more than 2 SCART inputs. Basically our TVs are the same as yours but with the extra option of RGB SCART. Whats not to like? I notice this vid got its first dislike just when you commented,  coincidence? )
retrogametech D: Never had a original Xbox? OH NOES!!!
retrogametech It blew my geeky mind :P . Full control over my CRT? Yes please!
retrogametech Yeah, exactly, no RGB...
retrogametech Just imagine how this would look with a quality vga mod installed into the Dc instead of the box.
retrogametech Haha, its great you can now pick up quality devices like a BO telly for so cheap. I got myself a really nice late model CRT Sony Trinitron for 25 a few years back. I still use it for hooking up my MVS board. Lovely! :)
retrogametech I dont get it. Non of my old consoles on old TVs had black scan lines. It looks interesting and all, but I dont see the appeal.
retrogametech Thanks :) . There are other devices like the XRGBmini that do a better job  are an allinone solution. But those can get pretty damn expensive. The SLG is a very nice little low budget alternative :) . I definitely think everyone who has a Dreamcast should own a VGA box! Makes games looks amazing :)
retrogametech Do whatever it takes to get RGB out of your systems! :) You wont regret it xD
retrogametech I didnt know that about the PS3, thats kinda surprising. I have the VGA cable for 360 but havent got around to testing it with the SLG yet. I hear its very good for shooters like Deathsmiles and retro ports like you mentioned.
retrogametech A VGA box is a must have !
retrogametech i dont like it. it darkens the image too much.
retrogametech Agreed. The traditional 2D games like Street Fighter or shooters like Giga Wing definitely benefit.
retrogametech Back in 1990! Crazy :P
retrogametech Commercial failure but excellent console and smartphone. Ive just finished collecting a full set of the games. Many of which are excellent and system exclusives. The NGage was aimed at a very different market than that of GBA.
retrogametech omg the megadrive could go online????
retrogametech Try calling an iPhone with that thing!
retrogametech Madness???? This... is... SEGA!
retrogametech you must have been bored as hell to come up with this video lol
retrogametech Yeaa its always good to have some spare SIMs hanging around though my new 02 ones have an expiry date slaps 02 :( I am guessing they will still bring NGages to life after that though :) Is your NGage the one where you talk to the mobile sideways or is that the other version?
retrogametech HAHahahaha. Calling MEGA DRIVE funniest thing Ive ever seen calling :p nice stuff man.
retrogametech Arrgh, weathers been crappy, it never usually snows this late in the year...
retrogametech Haha, werent the ice caps supposed to have melted by now? Dont worry, around here the slightest hint of snow and everyone starts driving at 5mph :P .
retrogametech Ive never been but the Peak District looks great for driving. Twisty roads and dramatic scenery FTW!
retrogametech Not the one Im using, no. The suction mount does a nice job of keeping the camera steady although it still suffers from some vibration. I found that speeding up footage 2x and rendering at 60fps does a good job of disguising camera shake :)
retrogametech The footage was pretty steady during this, does the flip have image stabilization?
retrogametech LOL. Your driving on the wrong side of the road :D
retrogametech RetroGameTech If only! Ive got plenty of assignments to keep me busy :(
retrogametech What a brilliant road. I have to get out into the Peak District to find anything like that, which is quite a trip.
retrogametech dude u sound exactly like Timothy V. Murphy :D
retrogametech RetroGameTech Was kindly donated a red 3DS in reasonable condition minus the fact the touch screen is broken, I was curious though what is the average price they sell for on AmazonEbay?
retrogametech He didnt get a refund, he traded it in, or sold it to the game store.
retrogametech I wish! haha Right now Im just trying to keep my overdraft in check :P Same here. Not many of the new games have interested me. There are a few on the eShop that look cool but I cant justify Nintendos asking prices. That new Luigis Mansion game looks cool, though! Do you think youll ever upgrade to the XL?
retrogametech My friend sold a brandnew 3DS at gamestop and he got 40 back  your gamestop sounds like heaven!
retrogametech i have the same problem can you tell me which ribbon you moved because i replaced the top screen and the speakers, still having the same problem
retrogametech I hate taking apart the 3DS. Those ribbon cables are such a pain to get seated properly. Managed to make a working one from 2 broken ones from ebay (one had been dipped in a cup of tea and the other had a smashed top screen) and have another broken one in my drawer that fell in the sea that I hope to fix. I already cleaned all the salt out of it and cleaned the contacts with isopropyl but am waiting for a charger to arrive from Ebay.
retrogametech I dont know why but I LOVE your vids man, good job with this one...
retrogametech Yeah, another video from RetroGameTech! You made my day!
retrogametech Bootleg NGage games, no, but that doesnt mean they werent pirated, given the nature of the storage format, you can just buy your own MMC card and stick on as many as you can fit. When I had my NGage, I couldnt find many retail games so while I did have a few legit games in my collection, most were loaded on that way. It did of course mean that more than one game could be loaded on at a time and with the need to remove the battery to switch out games this was more convenient.
retrogametech Congratulations Martin! Must feel great to finally track down that final game, well done! :D
retrogametech Could you make video about the top 5 games?
retrogametech congrats on completing the collection! id love to see gameplay from xandu next and requim of hell
retrogametech Ngage is in Tate mode?
retrogametech Okay now I want one. Been thinking about it for a while but now I definitely have to get one for my collection.
retrogametech Sorry man, may i ask you why you blocked me in my other channel TheCompleteJerk ? :(
retrogametech This is awesome. Well done. I am moving to Scotland soon ( Uni ), I would be honoured to visit your game room.
retrogametech The cards look like the ps vita game cards
retrogametech Unlike a boss, my 360 controller got rusty because I dont play it much so the batteries leaked! It doesnt work anymore even with other battery boxes. Easy to fix or is it time for me to seek a wired controller?
retrogametech Or as I like to call it, Salty Chew. actually made myself a little ill there
retrogametech I bought a new black wired controller a while back as my white wireless pads got years back are fucked .but with the new thumbsticks on the xbox controller now just fell different to me not the same smooth rubber as the old controllers .new controllers just fell more cheaply made to so just watching your vid and trying to switch round the thumbsticks.
retrogametech like a boss. i had a mare takin a 360 controller apart.. well the putting it back together bit was where i had trouble cos the shoulder button bit was snapped. i have a thumbstick that coasts to the left after youve let go of it.. is this somethin that could be fixed by just replacing the stick or do you think its a deeper problem with the innards?
retrogametech also, are those the same size as a gamecubes left analog stick?
retrogametech They used white LEDs to get a light blue color?
retrogametech Nice, this the import version? This is the first game I purchased when I bought my Dreamcast, from what I remember I had to buy an under the counter bootdisk to play it. Ive played it since on the xbox and the english voice overs just sound wrong :(
retrogametech I still love this game, this was fun to watch Martin. tengu always gave a hard time, hate that guy...lol
retrogametech Wow, that was a fast game. I didnt realize that was a TECMO game, no wonder you like it.
retrogametech The Ls Castle stage is amazing, really huge. Shame it was not revived in DOAD and DOA5U.
retrogametech I have been hoping for you to do something like this for a long time.
retrogametech Thanks, I appreciate that :)
retrogametech Ah one of my favourites! I really like the music in DOA 2. Oh and Tengu is the most annoying, cheap boss in DOA, apart from Alpha152. Nice video Martin, nice to hear your opinion on DOA 2 I love the game a lot.
retrogametech Ive seen too many 80s action movies so I recognised that dopey voice of his straight away. I had a good chuckle when I saw the workout tape lol
retrogametech Those are probably hatched markings vehicles are supposed to stay off them in order to keep space between the lanes.
retrogametech On street parking is not uncommon here. Roads are generally narrow and space is at a premium. You can park where you want as long as theres no restrictions and youre not causing an obstruction to other road users. But this is mostly me driving through a speed restricted residential area. You wouldnt see someone park like that on a busy main road for example.
retrogametech RetroGameTech Im guessing you either live in Quarter, Glassford or Strathaven. I live in strathaven :D
retrogametech cheers for the info on the music. shades of daft punk.. which can only be a good thing. :) cool vid. ive got my theory test on tuesday.. finally gettin round to it. lookin forward to toolin around town, with some tunes like this bangin out.
retrogametech Are you driving the Batmobile? :)
retrogametech Not from Hamilton but I stay near to it :)
retrogametech whats your honest thoughts on a original gameboy with backlight? do you get good contrast or is it washed out? also does it show up all the dust etc? would you recomend it or not?
retrogametech Theres no other logical explanation, got to be magic! xD
retrogametech Thanks, glad you enjoyed it :)
retrogametech Since when did Sonic come out on the Gameboy? Im sure Sega and Nintendo were huge rivals at the time?
retrogametech Thank you for letting me know. This video was awesome by the way. New sub. for sure.
retrogametech I gave my honest thoughts in the video. And itll only show up dust if you dont remove any while installing.
retrogametech awesome then, Ive always wanted to backlit my dmg gameboy !
retrogametech I did a video about it not too long ago. Its a bootleg game.
retrogametech Is there some sort of mirror film or alike that should not come of when peeling off the film you do at 03:40? Because i know have a backlighted DMG, but an inverted image.
retrogametech That is neat. I always felt the dreamcast had the most unique memory card.
retrogametech Its probably closer to seconds :P . I didnt actually test but Id guess it wouldnt be that great.
retrogametech I kinda thought so too :P
retrogametech Not really youll probably need to install a frontlight in there.
retrogametech Awesome job Martin :) Looks great. Interesting how the backlight is made and put together.
retrogametech wow that is awesome!!! would love to have one of those..... excellent work Martin :)
retrogametech Mate lovin your videos. Youve inspired me to get as many 360 games as possible and im holding you fully responsible for my ebay addiction! Lol. Best thing tho is that your scottish! Im living in australia but im from ayrshire. Keep up the good work mate!
retrogametech Why? The Ps3 thumb sticks are fine. Plus, The Wii thumbsticks are better than the GC thumbsticks.
retrogametech Oh Great ! thanks for letting me know !
retrogametech where did you get the green mat? thanks
retrogametech Game suggestions: Devils Crush  Great pinball game Military Madness  Nice little war game, not too complex Space Harrier  Pretty good port Before spending a lot of money on games, Id suggest that you download an emulator like TurboEngine and try them out. Then youll know which ones youll like.
retrogametech Thats cool that you got a fair price and was able to fix it up. I think its interesting to see the inside of a video game console. That I wouldnt have the patience to fix them like you have. XD
retrogametech yeah i love my jamma modded pc engine ) i bought it from a guy on the german arcadeforum for 110 including gallaga88 and gunhead aka blazing lasers i made an unboxingvideo of it if you wanna check it out, but i still have to upload some gameplayvideos of my new pc enginge games D
retrogametech Was that Sony chip part of the sound system by any chance? Seen a very similar looking chip in my stereo.
retrogametech Haha, Ive seen worse and tbh I probably wasnt much better at soldering until recently :P I love these little cards the TG16 games come on! Blazing Lazers is a game Ive been wanting to try for a while. It didnt disappoint :)
retrogametech Thanks dude. Its just a bit of luck and knowing what to keep an eye on )
retrogametech great vid..man this must be the month of the turbografx 16..i just found one yesterday at a swapmeet for 4 dollars yup true story ..i was on youtube looking for vids of how to clean and refurbish it and boom i find yourse..
retrogametech Yeah, has quite a few Japanese games up for sale and pretty cheap too! I saw he had a loose copy of AlesteM.U.S.H.A up for 25 just the other day! I was very tempted, lol.
retrogametech I thought MVS carts cost like 200..or am I thinking of AES.
retrogametech Haha, that would be Ash. A stereotypical BDSM homosexual character who was removed from western releases in a bid to presumably avoid controversy. WarioWare Twisted is batshit crazy and seriously awesome! The twist mechanic works perfectly (rumbles too!) and the game is ridiculously lol funny :) . There are a couple of US sellers right now  cart only around 11  4 postage. Worth it IMO!
retrogametech Love your pickups mate, always something intriguing. A question re the dreamcast white labels are they legi? I see them on eBay a lot and have never been convinced in regards their authenticity. Its not a big deal on the price you paid, but I see some seller charging loads for them.
retrogametech lol  the tranny biker on BK3 ) ooh warioware twisted, i was tryin to get hold of that a while ago, but most copies i saw were pretty expensive. so do you rate it? does the twist thing work well?
retrogametech the clone MD cost 30usd free world wide shipping for a brand new one its boxed ect
retrogametech Interesting, Why did you think it was a bootleg while bidding? . the label is convincing. The boards are a dead give away if you can see them. More info on what made you suspicious would be great to know. thanks. Side Note Ive purchased about 80 MVS carts and have never been tricked into a boot leg yet. Every cart was checked on the GOTWALLS MVS site for authenticity.
retrogametech Dude, I just love the Japanese Mega Drive boxes, much better than European or US releases.
retrogametech You should sell them 10 dollars for card and 5 for roms
retrogametech Its an excellent flashcart and very good quality! Its what I use to play games like Shantae which cant be found easily or emulated properly.
retrogametech Thanks dude! But I mostly just follow tutorials or use info other people have discoveredposted online. Soldering isnt too difficult to learn either :P
retrogametech Nicely Done! Got to love the 8Bit Generation. :) Cheers!
retrogametech nice work! i have a gb usb as well i use it for chiptune :D
retrogametech Hey Retro if I also live in Scotland if I was to send you my ds lite and a new case with some money would you fix it for me? You could make a video on it if youd like. Thanks :)
retrogametech Rubs hands together evil laugh xD
retrogametech I wanted to do this before too. I have found some schematics to do it and bought everything that needed for 5 carts  was a lot of money. The problem is the flash chip. There is only 1 company that sells it but only in giant packs and that is a whole lot money I cant afford... :(
retrogametech One of MacGyvers best friends!
retrogametech Im blown away about the screen fix! Im totally going to fix mine now!
retrogametech Thx you fixed my game boy
retrogametech Youre right, thank you.
retrogametech anyone noticed thanks nerd on the package?
retrogametech Achievement unlocked: Fix a Gameboy Original
retrogametech How do I reattach the rubber strip under the screen? Im planning to repair my childhood Game Boy that has dead pixels.
retrogametech good idea loving that for the next video!!!
retrogametech 4:23 Im more interested in the Back section. XD Btw, great video! :D 1 like
retrogametech Id love to send you a haggis !
retrogametech hahaha, I remember that stuff man
retrogametech VIEWERS OF SCOTLAND CHANT IT TOGETHER NO SUR... I MEAN IRNBRU And Luke you pronounced it right! :D
retrogametech Coke cola is the biggest selling soft drink in every country in the world except scotland where its irn bru
retrogametech Haha, awesome gift Martin. Guessing youll be responsible for Lukes sugar high :p
retrogametech Props to Martin on sending an awesome gift box, definitely makes me want to make some pixel art myself.
retrogametech As a Scotsman, I approve of this gift a lot!
retrogametech Just reminds me of when the cinema snob did a brad tries on Irn Bru.
retrogametech IRN BRU, Made in Scotland from girders.
retrogametech NECTAR OF THE GODS! Somebody recently was telling me after doing some traveling. Its HUGE as a vodka mixer in East Europe with kids since the Soviet bloc breakup.. 5 factories alone in Russia!
retrogametech Hows it supposed to work? I go to bed at 10pm so I am fresh for work which I get up at 6am for, so unless I download at the weekend they wont be making any money from me, its a seriously dumb move.
retrogametech due to nintendo based in Germany!!its crazy! great channel,i subbed after seeing lukemorses vid on your christmas present!i love irnbru!
retrogametech People actually buy things from the eshop?
retrogametech Boycott downloadable content. Refuse to buy it until Nintendo grows the hell up. Its obvious they havent learned from their Mortal Kombat debacle in the 90s. Nothing turns things around like a good hit to the wallet !
retrogametech This is another reason to stick to retro gaming
retrogametech lol thats nintendo for you, but oddly enough they are hell bent on resident evil as being of one of the systems selling points, kind of renders the idea moot.
retrogametech Larry commenting on a RetroGameTech video? BEST AMALGAMATION EVAR :D
retrogametech This definitely wont help against nintendos kiddie console image, what an absolute joke.
retrogametech Good news Nintendo just lifted the access restrictions to mature content on both the 3DS and Wii U.
retrogametech That seems about right. Germany was one of the countries that supposedly got a small number of the 101s
retrogametech i hate you ! i try so hard to get a 101! i have repaired like 9 001s :(
retrogametech Im not really looking to buy anymore systems these days  Im broke :P
retrogametech THIRD! also i love your vids and im trying to repair a ds lite and an SP :D and not anover MVS...
retrogametech desert strike advance looks really good i had it for my game boy pocket and its secwill and it would be cool to get it for the game boy advance. also is there any way to add a back light to an advance
retrogametech Have you heard about the k1 gbas and the revo k101 gbas? Im not sure whether I should keep looking for a good deal on an ags101 or just pick up one of those. I currently have an ags001 and a psp, and neither really cut it for me, the psp screen has ghosting and the psp has no multiplayer and the Ags001 doesnt have the greatest colours.
retrogametech Lol, just look for incorrectly listed auctions. The pink GBA 101 I got was listed as a GameBOX advance :P.
retrogametech Great idea with the 3.5mm socket in place of the RF. Ive just modded mine following your example but used a single 3way boat rocker (onoffon). Works very well and looks nice and clean. Thanks for all your videos. They give me the confidence to have a go at modding.
retrogametech cool stuff makes me want to try a regionlang mod on a genesis
retrogametech Yes you will need to switch off the overclock for the Mega CD and 32x as they wont work properley with it as I think they have some kind of sync with the 7mhz clock speed and the 10mhz would mess it up. I think Virtua Racing (MegaDrive NOT 32x) wouldnt work properley either.
retrogametech Ive seen it, I just prefer to have full manual control over my settings :P .
retrogametech I do love it, but I only use the Model 2 Megadrive, for one great reason. I muuuuch prefer the model 2 Sega CD, as it was a top loader and I love top loaders! If I could find the block to make it work nicely with a megadrive 1 I would, but until then, Ill stick to my model 2s :P
retrogametech To cut the holes I first drill out the center and then use mini files to file out the shape I want. Didnt know that about the serial port. I love to test that out some time!
retrogametech Your offthecuff videos and easy manner are one of the many reasons why I love your videos. Also, replacing the RF output with a 3.5mm output is a GREAT IDEA! I hate seeing the cable hanging off the front of my Genesis!
retrogametech Martin, in theory shouldnt the MD stereo out run into the mix port of the Mega CD, then the stereo out of the Mega CD into the 32X?
retrogametech The overclocking mod is my next project. Have you noticed any issues using an overclocked megadrive on a mega cd? I would assume all would be well if you switch off the 10mhz so it runs as standard?
retrogametech Your hand shakes a lot man. Might need to check your blood sugar.
retrogametech Thanks dude. Im going to try and keep on top of this project and make regular updates :)
retrogametech Nice layout Martin. Cant wait to see the final product..:)
retrogametech Nice plan you put together. Following with interest :) Cheers James
retrogametech Thanks for the tips Ed. I think cutting the MDF clean and accurate is going to be my biggest challenge. Ideally I should use a table saw but unfortunately I dont have access to something like that. Im going to have to do a lot of sanding I think! Im surprised you havent gone down the CMVS route yet! :P At least you have your fancy AES to play Neo Geo on!
retrogametech scart is still confusing to me. why couldnt they just use different connectors for each thing? i am sure there are just as many people that dont know what connection is going through that connector as there would be on different connectors.
retrogametech Maybe instead of removing the metal of the controller ports just cut off the boltscrew parts leaving the metal surrounds then mount on the mdf or the plastic panel which ever way you choose, that way the metal will be flush with the wood or plastic and will be much stronger. :)
retrogametech Ive seen a few people starting similar projects on here, yours looks like its going to be nice, looking forward to seeing the finished product mate. Wish i could do stuff like that.
retrogametech Lol, you could make it portable
retrogametech I always do that too!
retrogametech My Dreamcast has an orange swirl and Im American.
retrogametech The title of this is misleading, you never took your clothes off.
retrogametech No, Dreamcast uses a proprietary format called Gigabyte Disc (also sometimes called GigaDisk). So in this case its a GDROM not CDROM.
retrogametech awesome you took stripped that down like a boss , your videos are really top notch :)
retrogametech anybody else use ice cube trays on all their projects now...aha
retrogametech Thanks Martin, really enjoyed this!
retrogametech :D its one of those thing that changes your life ! theirs no going back now aha i actually went out to buy an ice tray specifically!
retrogametech Martin, youre spot on in regards to the Space Harrier BGM. I think thats probably the western release of the early Sega Ages 2500 games that were developed by the second party 3DAges  which explains why they veer from the original games to such a degree.
retrogametech best space harrier 2 version is on the Saturn, Sega Ages Vol 1, also includes outrun and afterburner 2, also really good versions. the music is damn good in them. highly recommend picking it up if you have a saturn.
retrogametech You should replace the sega channel cart with the power base converter and a master system game!
retrogametech the golden axe remix looks quality haha might look out for that ive just starting picking up ps2 games, and also original xbox games(again) your setup is quality, i had a set of wireless controllers for the master system although they died long ago, not sure if they worked on the megadrive also but they had C buttons and were megadrive shaped think i have the reciever around somewhere. and oooh jesus that space harrier music is pure cheddar cheese
retrogametech You seem Like a nice person, I think you present in a very well thought out and well spoken manner. You seem like the kind of person i would become fast friends with. Well who knows right? I have no idea if your open to making friends through youtube? If you do feel like making a friend I would be happy to chat and talk games.
retrogametech Jesus christ 10k subs, I thought you were niche dude but you bloody went Hollywood without me noticing :D Congrats!
retrogametech I actually own the 6 button wireless controllers with the receiver. They still work great. I like them better then the original 3 button controller. The d pad is much better and not stiff.
retrogametech Thats the coldest shout out Ive ever heard. lol
retrogametech Thank you very much. Youre really good at it, amd your tutorial is very helpful. It will help me a lot to fix my 3DS.
retrogametech where can i get one of those gameslot things?
retrogametech So the cover to the motherboard is just crosshead screws and not Nintendobits? So If i only had two small connectors inside the cartridge bay bent, then I should be able to band them back into place right? Can I reinforce them with solder or electrical tape?
retrogametech Love your teardownsDIY fixes videos, splendid channel man. Do you know of any other pages like Dealextreme?
retrogametech Thank you!, glad you enjoyed it :)
retrogametech Can you put videos into playlists for each system please?
retrogametech Thanks. Soldering isnt as hard as some people make out. A little bit of practice on some old hardware and youll be confident in no time! :)
retrogametech Definitely. I had never used a solder wick before I watched this video. Instead, I used a springloaded solder sucker. After watching this, I thought Id give a wick a go and now prefer using it over a sucker.
retrogametech Really interesting video :)
retrogametech Awesome dude sorry it too soooo long to reply had a complete pc meltdown!
retrogametech What a wonderful collection of gaming systems . Thank you very much for keeping this systems live for us .
retrogametech Nice to see the little glimpse of the Laseractive sir! :)
retrogametech Did you get my PM the other day? Ive still not heard from you.
retrogametech Really enjoy your videos Luke, it was RetroGameTech who put me onto your channel, him and Classic Games Room :D
retrogametech does the PhilipsCDi 220 have any value at all i just got one for free is it worth anything ?
retrogametech Thanks. Theres really nothing in my setup that would cost a lot to buy. Most of these systems I bought really cheap or faulty on ebay. Just clean them up, do a couple of mods and yourre good to go! :) I have the N64 but was never a big fan. I actually dont like many of the consoles from the era. The PS1, N64 and Saturn for one reason or another never interested me much. I think it was the move away from 2D sprites to the much less attractive (for the time) pologonated 3D environments.
retrogametech Do you play any PC games?
retrogametech My setup is a laptop with a load of emulators
retrogametech I use all these consoles regularly so theres no point hiding them away in storage. If anything wears out or breaks then Ill just fix or repair it. The ones in storage wouldnt be used very ofteneven so theres no point in having them out on display etc.
retrogametech We have the same TV cabinet thing :D
retrogametech Definitely worth picking up! Cost me about 30 2 years ago and plays 1080p mkv files and just about anything else you throw at it! :)
retrogametech Thanks, I appreciate you watching and taking the time to comment :)
retrogametech hey dude can i ask a quick question ? im in need of a new tv you see because im trying to keep hold of this old crt i have right now but its going old and seems to be dragging a bit now. But i have some retro consoles as well as current gen, does that sony bravia tv you have play retro games well ? i know people say some hd tvs make the retro games a bit blurry, but d they work alright with that tv ? if so could you give me the name and model of it please ? thanks alot buddy !!! :D cheerz !! :)
retrogametech my brother still using his DSTT card for his DS:Lite, had to update his firmware to 1.17 and stick it on the micro SD card so he could run all the pokemon games on it
retrogametech wasnt the original DS flashcart the M3 adapter? i had one near launch it was for GBADS and took big CF cards later on the R4 and M3 used the same components if remember and its just a different shell
retrogametech And emulating isnt pirating games?
retrogametech There are cards that run on the 3DS, but as the system updates so often you constantly have to upgrade the software on the card. Its a pain, Ive got one.
retrogametech These are supposed to be illegal to sell on ebay...
retrogametech Go to the official site Ed, there are a few. Some games seem to work with different ones. Very annoying.
retrogametech Love these little flash carts. All my game collection in one cart is a beautiful thing.
retrogametech Looking for the correct firmware for your clone? I really cant help sorry. There are just so many clones and hardware variations with hundreds of firmwares its impossible for me to say which one youll need. You can maybe try one of the generic Wood firmwares people have mentioned here. But other than that Im afraid its just a case of trial and error until you find the correct one.
retrogametech The TT cards work nice, used to have one years ago for my DS.
retrogametech I actually have Sonic 3D Blast 5 on a separate cart. Seriously.
retrogametech where did you get this?
retrogametech Its funny because the music is Sonic music in slow mode and kinda bad a bit, but I can hear angel island on the 1st level.
retrogametech Its actually not too bad. The controls are a little unresponsive but otherwise its a pretty decent bootleg. A lot better than that Sonic Fighter GBA game I got a few weeks back.
retrogametech Its the MD everywhere except North America. They had to change the name in North America because of trademarklegal issues.
retrogametech Where did you get this???
retrogametech The Title Screen music is the Title Screen music from Sonic  Knuckles and Green Hill Zones music is Angel Island Zone Act 1 from Sonic 3. Just horrible, 8bit versions.
retrogametech Green hill  angel island I think
retrogametech I think these were mostly sold in places like China and Taiwan. From what people have told me, lots of stores in China openly sell bootlegs and fakes as the norm. Here in the UK theres usually always a stall at every flea marketcarboot where people can buy cheap games.
retrogametech 2:20 I cant find a faulty NES gameboy advance, so Im combining a faulty flame red and a pearl blue
retrogametech Excellent projects as always!
retrogametech You are what inspired me to buy my first retro console (SNES) and fix it 3
retrogametech why dont you just buy a new one and just repair that one it would save you money and repair time
retrogametech Martin, I know you deal with these things, so I thought I might as well ask. Do you have any spare Dreamcast composite cables? I bought 2 Dreamcasts from Gumtree and the guy didnt give me any.
retrogametech nice lime green ds its not physcolgical its proven that the colors and the quality on the motherboard and the ds itself is better than any other Ds lite hoped this helped bye mate.
retrogametech I find it amazing how people will let their stuff get so dirty. Even more so when they sell it and send it off like that. Not even a quick wipe down, Id be embarrassed to sell something like that. When I traded in my my black DS lite to get a 3DS the guy was amazed at its condition. I got it in December 06 but it was mint condition, simply because I kept it in a case with a cleaning cloth from day one, and applied screen protectors day one. No crack in the hinge, so scuffs or scratches on it.
retrogametech No, but I think there are a few videos showing that on YouTube already. As long as you are reasonably confident with a soldering iron then its not too difficult.
retrogametech Keep up the good work mate great video :) I always wanted a nes
retrogametech 10 pounds is 16.68 dollars. Sorry. But you were close enough. So yeah
retrogametech OK, I just did this with one i got from ebay, the sega cd worked and the genesis worked but I fried 2 of my 32xs doing this. Is it the 32x doesnt support more than 4a? I have another 32x but i am afraid to try it since it might burn it.. my room smells like burned electronics after this. can you help me out? do you think i may have reverse polarity on it.? i think I have reverse polarity before by accident and this has never fried them like this.
retrogametech If I ever get my Genesis  CD  32X working, Ill give this mod a try.
retrogametech I never seen this but it looks cool
retrogametech Dam I Love Your Setup! All I Currently Have Room For Is My Wii, Gamecube And 360. I Have To Keep M y PS2, N64 And Anything Else On A Seperate Table.
retrogametech Hey martin, neat mod looks like it save you a lot of power  gets rid of those nasty 90s brick plugs lol, what is that in the master system card slot?
retrogametech Woah, thats kind of creepy, it looks just like what I did... Complete with the psone plug... OO
retrogametech Most of the official PSUs state 10V as their output. I think the Master System is the only one that states 9V. Testing with a multimeter showed most official Sega PSUs output over that at around 14V. But all the consoles have regulators and circuitry inside them to lowermanage voltage to the levels they require (probably only about 5V7V in most cases). You can happily run a Mega Drive using a 7.5V supply as long as the PSU has a high enough Amp rating.
retrogametech were do i send my money!!!
retrogametech Retro Game Cave sells all in one PSUs for the Sega CD 32x
retrogametech A mini arcade cab with something like a small computer monitor would be cool
retrogametech hey dude, hope you get better soon! Also, ive been wondering for a while, where did you get your watch? Its awesome! :D
retrogametech I really like the compact size of this board, it should make a nice looking console when youre done. I also really like the NeoGeo CD controllers. The picture looked great to me. Hope you feel better soon.
retrogametech Get Better Man. Just Invite Some Women Over, Being Stuck In Bed Wont Be So Bad Then.
retrogametech WoodMDF is probably the easiest to work with. MDF is also really flat and smooth which is good for painting andor adding some decals :) The only downside to MDF is getting wet (not a problem here) and its a bit heavy..probably nothing to worry either since its a small console.
retrogametech Thats what Id like to do with one of the other boards Im working right now. Ive got a spare old monitor sitting in storage that would be perfect for something like that :)
retrogametech For sure! Lets make it happen! :P
retrogametech Haha, a game youve never seen before? Surely not? :P It caught my eye on eBay a few weeks back. Had to check it out and see if I could get it dumped.
retrogametech i see a sonic.exe icon in here
retrogametech To be honest I like the music in the game.
retrogametech now i know what were aaaalll thinking right here 3:20
retrogametech omfg the music...MAKE IT STOP haha
retrogametech Havent played Super Mario 4, Ill look that up when I get the chance. The hacks on cartridge I have are Pokemon Naranja, Quartz, Blue Sea, and Arcoirus.
retrogametech Man that music DOES start to grind your nerves fast! At first I thought it wasnt THAT bad but boy was I wrong...
retrogametech get your kilt on your lad
retrogametech do you know a fix for only audio from left side?
retrogametech enjoyed the ramble, tech stuff isnt boring if youre into this stuff. cheers
retrogametech anybody know how to fix if your optical case thing comes off ? please reply if so
retrogametech Then dont read it moron.
retrogametech my ax pros dont light up anymore:( theyre just dead! fkin bullshit
retrogametech Im not an expert but I agree with lukemorse1 try swaping out that bios chip but the the green screen that u get might be somethung to do with a dodgy video chip or processor like I said Im not an expert just something I thought of :) hope u get the board working soon
retrogametech heres the menu: HARDWARE MENU SETTING UP THE HARD DIP SETTING UP THE SOFT DIP BOOK KEEPING SETTING UP THE CODE NUMBER SETTING UP THE CALENDER EXIT
retrogametech Work ram test, I mean
retrogametech Thanks! And yeah it pretty frustrating working on these boards :P
retrogametech The toughest soldering job Ive done on a game console was to replace the cartridge slot on a Mk1 Sega Genesis. Ive never tried SMD but I do have a good soldering station so Ill probably do it sometime.
retrogametech I owned the SNES close to when it came out when I was 7, it got lost (how isnt relevant) but I didnt have a problem emulating instead. I did buy another SNES off ebay more recently and will usually prefer that if I have the game, but I dont feel I really lose anything by emulating the games I dont have. One advantage of emulation is the fact that your game saves dont have a limited lifespan since you can copy them and save them and back them up like any other disk file.
retrogametech No worries, I wish hed reply to me though :(
retrogametech Any idea how to do this for GBA carts? They dont have the little handle area at the top where a taller battery holder could fit.
retrogametech yep battery in ruby mine is dead :(
retrogametech A great tip Martin, one of the reasons I subbed : )
retrogametech Id recommend purchasing a Mega Memory Card (Game Boy Color). You can back up a lot of your save files with it! Ive backed up most of my GBGBC saves already! It works great!
retrogametech I have to correct you in that. Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire have batteries but theyre used ONLY for the internal clock feature. The cartridges use EEPROM to save and not SRAM. If the battery dies out on them, they can still save fine, its just that the few time clock events in the game wont occur properly.
retrogametech Im planning to do this with a load of my gba games!
retrogametech Is that metallica ride the lightning I hear in the background , awesome man .
retrogametech Is it me or does this guy sound like Kevin McKidd
retrogametech I would leave i8t looking standard , a classic in e making, what a gem
retrogametech Would you make me one of these if i sent you my xbox
retrogametech Since its a crystal edition I think it could do with some lighting mods! lol :P
retrogametech Not sure  the emulator would need to be written to accept it.
retrogametech I just picked up the exact same thing but halo green edition with a 200 gig hard drive for 80 us dollars
retrogametech Is the Xecuter 3 the best mod chip for the original xbox?
retrogametech Someones listening to RIDE THE LIGHTNING! fist bumps
retrogametech I suggest before start desoldering the big chips you should find the power and ground of the Yamaha and Z80 chip and cut only those legs first and then power the whole thing up. Cut first the power of Yamaha then test, then if nothing cut ground of Yamaha then test. Cut z80 power and test and etc you should get something on the screen, since these boards do have some BIOS checking . (and install the bios of course...)
retrogametech Never boring Martin :) The Yamaha sound chip too hot to touch...Id say swap that out but also with my ocd, find out where the soundaudio caps are and replace. Just ordered the UnoBios  after watching Lukes video, its a definite must have. Havent had a chance to test mine out yet...still waiting on the JAMMA harness  unibios. Interesting some of the similarities of the Neo Geo and GenesisMegadrive. Both have a main Motorola 68000 based cpu and a Zilog Z80 cpu to handle sound.
retrogametech Im always interested in listening to you ramble for 10 minutes! xD
retrogametech Lol, well thats good to know!
retrogametech AES I mean, I dont have a MVS.
retrogametech shut up and take my money!!!!!!!!!!!
retrogametech You mentioned LikSang... how I miss that place.
retrogametech Awww that is the cutest thing I have ever seen! I want one!!! :D
retrogametech All my pockets would be full then
retrogametech Hows the game play on it? LOL
retrogametech Lol, that would be awesome! But imagine trying to keep track of all those tiny cartridges! :P
retrogametech I had no idea they had all of the Sega consoles featured in such way. Looks like you got more to hunt down now.
retrogametech i want one! thats too cool
retrogametech These days they could make a real working one in that size, and if they used a Micro SD Card in the cart you could have every game ever made all packaged in one tiny little unit :)
retrogametech Booo you should have got a multi cart with Super Dodge Ball!
retrogametech Cool! You should make some vids!
retrogametech Hope you get it working, Luke is extremely knowledgeable and has a ton of experience.
retrogametech luke morse is a geezer! good luck on the project do love your vids!
retrogametech Haha I would usually frown upon the 48in1 cart, but I must admit I have one myself for my arcade cabinet, but possibly has 80 games on it, not at home at the mo, mvs carts whilst cheaper than aes carts, are still very expensive :(
retrogametech What keywords would you use in an eBay search? 3D LCD glasses? Shutter glasses? You didnt really specify or give a link.
retrogametech Ive got the official glasses, I got them relatively cheap. Unfortunately theyre too small for my head! I will get some of these, Im surprised this works!
retrogametech Some questions: 1.Could you please say exactly how is called the glasses that are you using on your video? I wish order this glases but I want be sure that they will work with my sega master. 2. Do you need a crt monitor for get working properly the 3d effect with your sega? 3. Do you get a perfect effect? I mean, do you not perceive double images some times? I own the original 3d glasses,. Back on time the effect was perfect, but now sometimes I perceive double images because they aged. 3.
retrogametech Just wondering, do you have Space Harrier 3d? If so, how is the 3d effect on it? I have Space Harrier for Sega Saturn and it plays really well with the 3d controller.
retrogametech Punorama! You have no principles p
retrogametech The NGage has no video out so doubtful its possible. Cool idea though :)
retrogametech What would have been awesome, stick a cheap laptop in there, and run NGage emulated games on it. and also get the buttons to work too. and you have the worlds largest NGage!!!
retrogametech Hahaha, What is it with YouTubers always wanting to either grow or hide weed in my consolesmods? lol
retrogametech i would grow weed in it and use the count down to tell me when its ready lol
retrogametech Just ordered one of these after watching your review. To be honest, a fellow Brit saying its good sealed the deal. Bought mine from Germany through PayPal to be safe. And I am so glad someone else shares my views on downloading ROMs for oldgen consoles. The only people making money are the scalpers or excollectors that bought them all up. Still trying to get a cheap Blood Omen 1 legit though.
retrogametech I heard about things like this for the NES and SNES and stuff but is it possible to get flash carts like this for consoles such as N64?
retrogametech Yes Mother 3 works on it, and it is even better since you can patch a mother 3 ROM to English and play the English version. To play Mother 3 , select the game and press SELECT, then A. This will permenantly write to your cartridge, and will then load up instantly.
retrogametech the reset option is good so you can save your game even if the battery is dead
retrogametech Thats cool man. How much does it cost?
retrogametech I have almost 40 games for my GBA and hauling them all around with me really sucks because the case is about the size of a small purse. I feel ridiculous carrying it around with me. With this thing I can have all the games I own and dont own in one cart and leave all the other physical games at home. Having tons of cartridge games really destroys the portability of a console. I need one of these.
retrogametech Could i use this to play snes on my GBA?
GameSack Crap... I live in German :(
GameSack I hope they are as awkward in real life as they are on camera! For some strange reason though I wouldnt want it any other way.
GameSack Now if only you could come to San Antonio...Or Austin. Austins cool. But seriously. San Antonio.
GameSack I may actually go. (I live about 15 minutes from Arlington in the DFW area) Never been to any roundup gig like this. Ive been in the game scene since 1983 or so. (Created 3 or 4 myself) YES Im almost as old as you two!  DPerhaps Ill fork over 20 bux and head out. Ill put it on my calender... Wait, I got to get one first. Dang.. !Chow  Sonic Mario mixed breed duo!
GameSack Go to So Cal. Thx bye.... I wish :(
GameSack Hope you guys and everyone else at the convention have fun! I wish I was close to Texas, I would definitely go.
GameSack I actually live across from the Game Chasers (not to be creepy) so I will definitely be there. Never been to a gaming convention before.
GameSack I wish I lived in Texas. Well glad to hear you got in a convention. Hopefully this will bring in more people to appreciate this great show you guys make. Btw will you be doing a live broadcast of the show?
GameSack Neo geo the ultimate fighting console that every kid wanted but couldnt afford, so they rented it in a store. Or was i the only one
GameSack This is a great review of the Neo Geo CD guys. You both crack me up with your sense of humor. I am glad I subscribed to your channel last year. It was some time before you guys did your Sharp X68000 review which was an awesome review that everyone should see. Very informative and very entertaining! Two things you guys are good that! :)
GameSack Did Dave just bch slapped Joe? XD
GameSack Could you do a episode on bad licensed games. Theres plenty to choose from and I know you guys would show a game Ive never even heard of.
GameSack You guys are awesome. I really look forward to these reviews each week. So much effort and passion is incorporated into each episode. Great job!
GameSack Appreciate the laughs and for that game I will give you a 6.710 dollhairs
GameSack Broadcast quality show here!
GameSack Nice episode, but according to the wikipedia page the CDZ still had a 1x cd rom drive. It had an expanded cache for faster load times.http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiNeoGeoCD
GameSack Why would you rip video game music? I cant see the point. Seems a waste of time.
GameSack Lol. Ok, did you remove the first digit of your super popular puzzle video views? Call me a nerd, but I pulled it up and its got 14 thousand views. Sure, thats 14k views in two years versus the 15k views in 17 hours this one has gotten, but thats nothing to scoff at, guys.
GameSack Awesome. I love these Neo Geo episodes. Keep up the great work guys!
GameSack How often do episodes of gamesack come out, I started to miss u guys so I started watching older episodes... Again, huge fan of gamesack here!
GameSack One of the best gaming channels on YouTube...they should have way more subscribers.
GameSack Where did you get the shirt Dave?
GameSack Justice whats your amour called in your youtube picture ? The third age looking armour :P
GameSack Really good episodecheers from brazil!
GameSack I somehow missed this one when it came out a week ago!
GameSack Rudra no Hihou The Treasure of Rudra, one of Squaresofts obscure jewels from the last years of the Super Famicom (thus the probable reason It didnt make It to America as the N64 was just launched to sale for that time). I would also mention Pulseman but he came to America in 2009 via Wiis virtual console so, dunno if It counts:
GameSack Super Tempo  Tryrush Deppy in ONE Episode!!NICE!!  (Both REALLY Rare and expensive...)
GameSack You guys have some really good content. I also really enjoy your style of presentation. Keep it up Im mostly going through your back catalog of videos.
GameSack definitely too much shooters in this series... please get more crazy japanese titles :)
GameSack More like Try Rush  DERPY!! OooooooOoOooOOooo.... sick burn. :P
GameSack here is an idea game sack...you can roll with or eh, the idea. Home brew video games, hacks, part 2 with a twist, throw some creepy pastas in there. Here are few creepy pastas, dead sonic, tails doll from sonic racing whom makes people who pla as tails doll commit suicide, pokemon lavender town, white hand, lavender town music and more. I really liked that home brew episode so i threw that idea in there. Aright Dave and Joe
GameSack Frey looks adorable. Those graphics on Super Tempo are fucking awesome. Poppin seems like a girl Link.
GameSack do we keep what we earned in the beta or do we get something because we contributed by playing the beta
GameSack You should make a fantasy league with subs
GameSack DCOOP how did u not make the mut invitational better luck next year)
GameSack The design departments always leave these parts out of the blueprints
GameSack Ha ha ! Awesome! Man that takes me back to when my friends and I would make stop action movies. My cat loved it!
GameSack Once is enough for me. O.o
GameSack I havent been this confused since I saw the new ninja turtles trailer
GameSack HOW DOES THIS EVEN EXIST!? lol
GameSack I wanted to see a montage for the PlayStation games man.
GameSack I feel like I need a shower...
GameSack Just imagine what would happened if they added a Sony PS Move controller to that party
GameSack damnonly if PC had destiny RIP PC gaming
GameSack The best console ever after the PS2.
GameSack Ive never even heard of having to turn the playstation upside down. I never had any cooling problem I guess.
GameSack Mudo cons?....... Did you even play the game?
GameSack Great list and thanks for adding Kula World, Poy Poy  TombaTombi
GameSack Im surprised nobody mentioned spyro the dragon.
GameSack Hidden gem for RidgeRacer 1 once the game loaded,pop,out,the CD then,put your own,music disk in,the game ...,now Race on,
GameSack The underside of the CDs were clearly not black to prevent piracy. I remember the Action Replay chip that slid into the Parallel I0 slot on the right side of the Playstation on the back that would enable you to play copiedburnt Playstation games. Was pretty cool along with it acting as a Gameshark at the same time
GameSack tenchu? wheres tenchu!!!
GameSack 99 of the time I go back to old games, I am disappointed. They rarely hold up. A friend of mine played Crash Bandicoot again and was horrified. Well, yeah. The truth, of course, is that the craft advances. Rose tinted glasses notwithstanding. That said, remembering them is a lot of fun!
GameSack I like to imagine that the very last part of this video wasnt a scripted joke, and that the guy on the right is genuinely traumatised and didnt see that coming.Also, Scud is reeeeal mharti! Oh no, hes reeeal!
GameSack Loved Croc myself back in the days.Never played any of the others though, a store near me sells Billy Hatcher though.Maybe I should spend some money on it.
GameSack Id love to see you guys tackle on the modern mascots.
GameSack Game Sack  Always interesting reviews.
GameSack That punk skunk game looks like it should be on 16 bit consoles and looks like it shouldnt belong on the Playstation
GameSack I was really hoping you guys would show boogerman
GameSack My first thought was Zool
GameSack They should add Bubsy, that generic cat. Now THAT, was a failed mascot.
GameSack I cant believe you forgot about that bat thing from Sunsoft!
GameSack Das nukular ist der Knaller! Schn gemacht 3
GameSack Super Metroid isnt even a top 10 SNES game.
GameSack Why everybody is complaining about the games they havent mentioned.It is theirs top 10 not ours.If you all watch their show long enough than you know what kind of games they love.Metroid?Chrono trigger?We all know they excellent and I dont think everybody constantly have to tell us that they are.
GameSack Awsome new intro guys ! :)
GameSack That intro was hella epic.
GameSack great list... but Rondo of Blood  Super Castlevania IV
GameSack Top ten super grafx games. Oh wait....
GameSack Ha ha ha. Loved the Super Metroid bit at the end. In fact, your little epilogues at the end of your videos routinely make me laugh out loud. (Watched the Sharp X68000 one last night, and I loved the delivery at the end.)
GameSack Can anybody who had the patience to wait through that crap ass intro give me the rundown...
GameSack contra 3 should be on that list
GameSack If this is the other, where is the video with the first 16bit list?Did you mean the other except SF and MK?
GameSack Clay Fighter tournament edition was quite better than the first one. Hey how about Primal Rage?
GameSack I think you can set the controls in Ranma 12: Hard Battle to use up to jump.
GameSack Wingnut does not have an advantage over everyone because of his projectile. it is a well balanced game. i may only know one character well (Donatello) but i know that i can beat that proctile by jumping, my projectile, headspin attack, or back dash flip. its just like any other good fighting game. every move has pros and cons
GameSack Good job completely ignoring SNK.. King of Fighters, The Samurai Shodowns, Last Blades, the Fatal Furys, the Art of Fightings,the World Heroes, Matrimelee, Mark of the Wolves... you owe us a Neo Geo episode now! :)
GameSack Virtua Fighter  The beginning of Tekken
GameSack You should Dragon the Bruce Lee Story. It not only a great movie based game but also a great realistic fighting game
GameSack My problem with some of the 16bit fighters (Eternal Champions, Art of Fighting, the Karnov one, in example) is that I dont even get to know if I suck or not, because I can barely move! You start your first fight in a game you dont even know, and the A.I counterattacks EVERYTHING you do, stuns you, get close and kill you. I hate that kind of games.
GameSack Another amazing fighting game is Gundam Wing Endless duel for the SNES! It was released in 1996, really late on the SNES life, and it really shows it because its an arcadelike experience on the SNES! It has huge sprites, smooth and amazing animation, the controlls are pretty good, and the game itself is A LOT of fun! I dont know if it was released outside of Japan though... But I think it wasnt...
GameSack Someone needs a change of pants...
GameSack XD Man, you spent more time on the floor than fighting!With quarter donors like you I wonder how the arcades are dead.BETMARK
GameSack Its a damn shame that Mystic Warriors was never ported (hell, dont even on XBLAPSN), such a badass game.
GameSack some of these games look fucking badass  MUST BUILD MAME ARCADE MACHINE WITH HANDS AND WOOD AND SHIT!!!!
GameSack great video! I recommend you to play Psychic 5, even if theres a japanese version called Esper Boukentai for NES but is different from the arcade, which is awesome!
GameSack Redifer u sold ur house and moved u and ur wife into a studio apartment? Bummer.
GameSack Great episode. These games look awesome especially Mystic Warriors. Its a shame they never made it to consoles...
GameSack 13:05 That really is total badass! Same goes for all the little details!By the way, Merry Christmas! XD
GameSack We need a 3DO episode!
GameSack There was a Wild West Cowboys of Moomesa arcade game that played a lot like Sunset Riders. While I didnt care for the show or comics, the game was actually really fun.
GameSack Oh! Bucky OHare! I loved so much that game I played it till I was able to finish it with one credit using Jenny (Seriously: the cat chick had the best special attack IMHO. Not the strongest one but surely the smartest one!) and I would still play it.
GameSack another great episode, so glad you had a fantastic birthday, xx
GameSack good vid ! hoe many kills ?
GameSack The 2v2 things sounds awesome. Let me know if you need any help.Action Sack made a huge improvement. I always thought it needs to have all the crazy stupid games that are played just for fun.
GameSack My favorite game on the computer is Castlevania. Although I cant beat stage 4s Medusa boss its still fun but would recommend the PSX version for anyone especially the psOne classics version for 6.
GameSack love that they always have long videos these guys
GameSack The game you called salamander, is actually called life force salamander and was also ported to te NES
GameSack i never heard of sharp making a pc like console....thumbs up..ghost and ghouls looked great i thing...nice version.. overall the music was real great. ..a shame other consoles didnt do the same
GameSack What?? Where is ANGEL DIVE??
GameSack this was a great video, Ive seen these and other similar japanese only PCs mentioned in other videos and reviews but nothing really indepth that gives me a good feel as to what the system was like before this. Also both the review of The Cockpit and that final bonus like scene had me laughing so hard I was crying.
GameSack Love these documentaries! Keep them coming!
GameSack How about the Amiga 500? Or an episode devoted to the Turrican series!
GameSack I laughed way too hard when Joe got his Snatcher back :)
GameSack Im dead serious when I say The Cockpit looks realistic as fuck.
GameSack Where is Good Luck Charlie Brown for Atari 2600?anyway, eggcellent work guys!
GameSack marios wacky worlds of course!
GameSack new to this channel and have to say wow .. great work guys and please can you do another one of theses
GameSack what about Dinosaur Planet for the N64?
GameSack How do you record game music to your iPod?
GameSack Avatar the last air bender on the hyper scan.
GameSack Heres a suggestion: Space Fantasy Zone for the PCEngine CD.Its Space Harrier, but with many elements from Fantasy Zone. It would have tied the two series closer together.
GameSack LOOK at the Mr. Nuttz level design. i see stuff from sonic 1,2, AND 3!!!!look close at the floors and walls, background, ect. IDENTICAL
GameSack You guys are hilarious.
GameSack try to get 5 stars in the next episode. Get in as much trouble as you can.
GameSack Sohinki is a badass. Only when it comes to him losing at a game. Its just his nature. Dont judge.
GameSack 3rd is the one with the hairy chest
GameSack runawaythoughts  raywilliamjohnson  rileyrewind
GameSack DO THE HUNGER GAMES IN GTA V PLZ!!!!!!
GameSack You guys should go out in the open with no guns or anything ..just your fist and like fight each other till you guys die.....please that would be awsome
GameSack Lol joven said its the most reinforced playground Ive ever seen. Sohinki ran into a hot dog stand and joven said was it reinforced
GameSack All your base are belong to us... HAHAHAHAHAHAHhahahahahaaaa....I love it when I finally get a Smosh games reference joke.
GameSack Enjoy GTA V?! Then check out our channel and help us grow!!
GameSack Could you guys make so more video for every week?
GameSack all your base are belong to us! so funny
GameSack I dont care about the Duo Portable, but I will try to get a Mega DriveSuper Nintendo adapter.
GameSack looks pretty awesome, i might get it eventhough im a sega guy.
GameSack This was a really good video. Thanks for uploading.
GameSack This is one of those things that wouldve been awesome back in the day, but now... meh.
GameSack what no new years special?
GameSack What is the name of that SFC game they play on the retro duo portable? I own one and I am looking for some sfc games to play on it!
GameSack I laughed my ass off at 4.45
GameSack god that sega fan boy is a total douche he drives me nuts
GameSack Easy as holding the balls of god ..
GameSack Does he even know what bad apple is about?
GameSack Oh Mummy! was originally an Amstrad 464 release, back in 1984. I used to own an amstrad 464 at one point and I also had this game. This genisisMegadrive remake is pretty impressive and stays true to the original, even the music is the same.
GameSack Homebrew games  Game Sack  Great Review, nice video.
GameSack Please ditch the f1.2 lens
GameSack WHAT NO MOTHER 3 AKA EARTHBOUND 2 REALLY LOL
GameSack We need a Time Gal port to the Super NES!
GameSack Im not having great luck tracking down the Castlevania 2 rom hack mentioned that was released by Biscuit. Any pointers?
GameSack I just got an NES Powerpak to play a lot of these, good to see theres a few more out there. Id definitely recommend the Final Fantasy VII hack on NES. It started as an unlicensed pirate, then hackers translated it and made it a whole lot more playable.
GameSack The Dragon Quest games on Super Famicom! The best Dragon Quest games are the Japanonly ones on the Super Famicom, and there are amazing fantranslation hacks out there! I personally like them a lot more than Final Fantasy (Dont kill me) Also TOUHOU!!! (You gotta play Touhou 4 Lotus Land Story on the NEC PC9801 to listen to the original, and in my opinion best, version of Bad Apple!)
GameSack play a good game on the ps4 and not some kiddy stuff
GameSack can u play warframe in the next episode or have a channel of it like gta smosh?
GameSack plz make another episode plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
GameSack I was playing this game is soo gooood !
GameSack Yall should play infamous second son
GameSack play big rigs: over the road racing! u will see y
GameSack Santa Claus is coming to town. Beware!
GameSack Ho Ho Ho heres ur battle axe
GameSack I am no longer reading the comments on this video. Theyre of very poor quality. Mainly just accusing us of forgetting games. Guys, we cant read your minds and include exactly the games YOU want each episode. Its very frustrating to read comments saying You forgot  or How could you not include ? or No ? Im so disappointed!. Were definitely fine with people suggesting games for future installments or suggesting we try certain games (which a lot of you have been doing, thanks!) but the whining is not cool at all. So I probably wont be reading nor responding to any more comments on this particular video. I can now understand why AVGN doesnt comment on his videos any more. Well continue to include the games we want to include. Apologies to all of the really cool fans (which are most of you) for this. We really like you guys! Feel free to talk to us on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. :)
GameSack You should try Super Baseball 2020, pretty fun game. Virtua Tennis games are pretty good too.
GameSack I think Dave needs to get checked out for tinnitus.
GameSack Hey well guessed, I nearly didnt watch it, but enjoyed it in the end.
GameSack Great video. Thank you guys for putting so much effort in showing us your collection. You are awesome!
GameSack Hopefully in part 2 you guys do nba jam and nfl blitz , great games.
GameSack Why were all the women in the boxing game stacked? They all look like Dolly Parton!Anyways. I was hoping Dodge Ball games would have made an entry. Those are such funny games.
GameSack IM IN HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELL
GameSack ever time on a weekend I think im going to sleep one of game sacks videos appers
GameSack al realy fucking good
GameSack Nimm doch mit Abonnenten auf jedes RTC anderer Abonnenten
GameSack i would hate to be the guy who went X0 in swiss does the draft pulls crap and then loses because heshe pulled bad
GameSack what they are doing is also balancing what ppl can use if its all the same pack then u wont see something like drag rulers or spell books when u dont have these good cards so it can work but yah it would suck to not use a deck u have spent a lot of money on
GameSack I want deck profiles when that happens lol sike stupid idea but w.e
GameSack ...just gonna say konami is the worst company ever
GameSack This is a douchebag move by Konami, simply to push their shitty product. Anyone with any amount of skill can pull broken and steal the win from other players who have pushed themselves to get there.
GameSack Draft isnt just open the packs yourself and build a deck.
GameSack I dont think anyone who wins without this new format DESERVES to top. Im sick of seeing the same deck all the time, every time. Its so rare to see something new, and this at least makes strategy and intellect more important than a google search and spending money.
GameSack I think you are confusing draft with sealed. The Top 16 will be a draft, which is actually a very skill intensive format. Sealed is where you just open up your packs and build a deck.Go watch one or two Channel Fireball Magic drafts.
GameSack Do u get to keep the cards you pull???
GameSack They are right, winning through ingenuity doesnt mean anything. Its all about winning with brokedragons and swarms.
GameSack Turok 2 is much better than turok 1
GameSack Oh! Yeah i forgot ape escape 2
GameSack Great choice there Dave with Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins. The only flaw about the game I found is how easy it is, even for a Mario game. Except for the last stage which I found waaaay harder then all the other levels. Very frustrating when you want to just beat the damn thing already, lol.
GameSack Wow been trying to figure out the name to Pilotwings for the longest...
GameSack Great episode guys! Always an inspiration for us. Loved the Wonder Boy segment. Wonder Boy in Monster Land is definitely in my SMS Top 5. Personally I always felt Zillion II: The Tri Formation was a superior sequel to Zillion. Also, NICE call on Devils Crush. Used to play that game for hours with my TG16 buddy!
GameSack Well, guess Im not going to go to bed now...
GameSack i liked the thunderforce 3,4,5 and 6 better than 2 but i honestly loved them all.
GameSack Thunder Force II (now that a GAP) James Pond II (same) Otogi 2 (not as much but still a superior sequel to an already amazing game) while i dont agree about Super Mario land 2 since i like them equally  even find the 1st one to be a better platformer, its clear that Devil Crash improved a lot over Alien Crush mainly thanx to the added scrolling which made things so much more enjoyable! i especially love the Mega Drive version with its new  superb bonus stages  its new music! (which are remix of other Tecno Soft games)
GameSack Depresses the hell out of me that I still dont own one of those beautiful machines : Never seen one in a local store around my area ever.....ever.....criminalAlso I would like a Judge Judy game ala Phoenix Wright lol
GameSack The holy grail of consoles when I was a kid, 100 for a game was never going to be realistic back then. Would still love one though.
GameSack I never knew Vhs worked on the Aes.
GameSack lol.. Who holds a joystick like that? XD
GameSack wait did you unibios the neogeo
GameSack Your hands are a little bit ugly.
GameSack Who in the world uses an arcade stick like that?!
GameSack Watching this made me smile.
GameSack New Super Mario Bros. 2 is pretty disappointing for me, it just feels like a rehash of NSMBWii with some new levels.
GameSack Im not sure if this port counts as a disappointing followup or not but Marvel vs Capcom on the Playstation is a bit disappointing in comparison to the arcade version.
GameSack That Dave shirt is awesome
GameSack You guys just have the coolest damn shirts, I wish you had a list of links to where you got the ones you wear on the show or something, though I imagine its a variety of different sites and stores and thatd probably be a bit of a hassle.. but still!
GameSack bioshock infinite comes to mind
GameSack Never even heard of this channel but these videos are really good, informative and humorous I love channels that introduce me to new games and almost every video I have seen so far has done so in spades
GameSack Metroid Other M. After the Prime series that was a disgrace.
GameSack Guys, I liked your mention of Excite Trucks. I bought a launchday Wii and out of all the games, Excite Trucks is far and away the game I play the most on my Wii, period (although Smooth Moves! is a close second). Its just so goofy fun. I learned about Excite Bots and was planning on getting it this week thanks for saving me from disappointment! Speaking off Wii, I would say the Wii use is a disappointing followup console! Even Nintendo is slackin with solid firstparty releases for the thing!
GameSack ha game, I am disappoint
GameSack CKGR  Commander krieger Ghosts rules
GameSack Hacken ...am Arsch...
GameSack Screw you motherfucking Hacker
GameSack CAHC Commanders Anti Hacker Clan
GameSack FEA fickt eich Activision
GameSack GIGS  Ghosts ist geiler Shit :D
GameSack HKAP Hello Kittys Anal Party
GameSack You guys missed the Remake of Metal Gear Solid 1, Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes on Nintendo Game Cube. :) Would have been interesting to hear your thoughts on this. :)
GameSack Megaman Powered Up sucked. Really hated the changes, even if they were just minor in the original mode game.Edit: Megaman Maverick Hunter X was another turd. The SNES original was perfect, there was no need to remake this at all. If they did feel the need to do it, why not just make it in HD without the ugly polyginal based graphics. What a waste, much like the X games that were dumped out by Capcom on PS2.Finally, the remake of Ys 3. There was nothing really all that wrong with the original game, it was just a tad to short. The remake on PSP (and JPN only PC release) has no right to even exist with even worse and more annoying voice acting.
GameSack Pokemon remakes e.g. Soul silverheart gold
GameSack Blaster Master (the remake is a Wiiware exclusive).
GameSack 16:41 Stateside it had the awesome name of the Monkey King: the Journey Begins But it says Legend on the title screen....  Anyway  is a much cooler name (at least for the original)...
GameSack Suggestions for if you do another one of these: Phantasy Star Generation 1 (English translation available online now for play via Playstation emulator), Bionic Commando ReArmed (PS3X360PC), Monkey Island Special Edition Collection (PS3X360PC), PunchOut!! (Wii), Final Fantasy III (NDS), Tomb Raider: Anniversary (Wii), and Ys III Eternal (NDS)
GameSack You guys probably only do consoles, but for me the greatest remake of them all, Monkey Islands 1 and 2.It is perfect in every way and the function to switch between old and new so seemless was a simple stroke of genius :)
GameSack I got the physical copy of ducktales for ps3. Great game. Also thanks for telling me about Monkey King on Wii. I got this complete for 1.99 at disc replay.
GameSack I like Castlevania Chronicles for the PS1, but its more an updateremix of the Sharp X68000 game which was a loose update of the NES game.
GameSack fugazi huh? did u know theres a fugazi wutang mashup called wugazi?check it out its good
GameSack Deswegen sollt ihr das ja ndern :P
GameSack Ghost House in Brazil was reeskined as a Chapulin Colorado game haha
GameSack Hello friends I would like to see in the next episode, onimusha series, fatal frame, project blair witch (pc) and the slenderman the arrival )
GameSack well i ended up picking up ghost house (cart version) very cool game thx guys :)
GameSack That short film at the end was 3spoopy5me
GameSack Great episode guys!!! I wanted to look that Super Famicom game you showcased. What was it called again ?
GameSack I tried looking it up in gamefaqs but didnt find it
GameSack was that persona 3 music at the beginning?
GameSack I must have somehow missed that episode, but that just means I get another fresh episode to watch!
GameSack I remember seeing D in magazines. Looked so cool.
GameSack Thanks for noticing! :)
GameSack Also I know its completely random but have you guys ever thought about doing a super hero game comparison video? Like Marvel vs Dc and see which side had the better overall games.
GameSack This is REALLY cool!!! Lots of great visual ideas and the stop motion stuff is insanely good!!!
GameSack The Benny Hill theme music would have been great during this video
GameSack I know this is supposed to be a silly video, but the repetitive sound effect in the background reminds me of Begotten, therefore making this video way more unsettling by association.
GameSack I know the first thing I do when I enter a haunted house is take a poop.
GameSack Good job! I like... hahaha..
GameSack Havent you guys already posted that earlier?
GameSack I really enjoyed the carpet rollup scene. Excellent editing as always!
GameSack Not even quite sure what to say about this one
GameSack Start reviewing different kinds of shelled seeds so you can call the show Nut Sack
GameSack Wow, Darxide looks like a Playstation game!
GameSack So the best Sega could muster was a 150 equivalent of the sfx chip? What a piece of trash.
GameSack Im pretty sure you can press mode or something to get the 32x to go full screen. Im almost certain I did that as a kid, but everyone now says its windowed and thats it. So strange...
GameSack 7:20 Virtua Racing Deluxe
GameSack The 3rd one broke, i said fuck it  bought a PlayStation. Best move
GameSack Ah SEGA my FavouriTe c0mPANY of the GAMES!
GameSack I take that back, the Sega CD library is good, and I like it. Its suffering from some games like night trap and marky mark and the funky bunch make my video.
GameSack I had a 32X and I will never regret it!
GameSack Ristar being a game that time forgot is a bit debatable since it was includedin the Genesis Collection for PS3 and XBox.
GameSack If I had to say one of my personal favorite games time forgot, Id say Segas Virtual ON series. Its a series of high speed, Japanese 3D mech fighting games with some of the best music youll ever hear (especially when you play the Dreamcast version) But word of advice: Stay FAR AWAY from Virtual On Marz on PS2. (unless you live in Japan  The localization team absolutely BUTCHERED the American version, screwing with the enemy AI, and even removing whole game features, namely the highly requested Database mode.)
GameSack This is the loudest ive laughed at the post credits scene. Fantastic! Epic timing and Daves face is priceless
GameSack How come Dave never really gets to talk about the games?
GameSack U guys should do a Launch Titles  best and worst episode. I dont remember ever seeing a video on that. I think that could be a great episode
GameSack I loved Ristar, too. My kids still play it. Always thought it was pronounced R(eye)star, like rye bread...
GameSack Am I the only one that thinks the space ship at 1:30 looks like a penis?
GameSack Great job guys!I always enjoy your videos.
GameSack Surprised you didnt mention Crash Nitro Kart, the sequel to Crash Team Racing. Its not as good, but it was still pretty fun back in the day. Also, Bravoman appeared in Namco X Capcom, for some reason.
GameSack its weird because they took the blinking lights out when you died because it was believed to cause seizures so it became a solid red background and then the fade in.
GameSack Hi Friends,Enjoy the pictorial illustration of History and lore of Game of thrones, and this is about The Sack Of Kings Landing in House Lannister Perspective
GameSack You should have texted me I would have came down
GameSack Did you get the game links I sent you during the game? You said you dont have NFL Network, I dont either so I sent you links so you could watch the game.
GameSack Wow, what an awesome game full of explosions! And the best part is, Its on my Bday :D
GameSack Sam . . . suck my balls you cunt.
GameSack Moyes seems like a good lad, a TOO good lad. He is not tough enough at the moment. He is still taking all this crap from the fans and the board, the players... By the end of the game, when he was shouting: Go for it, all out!, no one really seemed that determined. I say the problem is with the players who think they know better. There is a communication problem, and some players are acting like such hot shots that it makes me angry. Moyes needs to start screaming, and showing everyone at Utd who is the Boss. If he cant do that, then he is wasting himself at this job. The diving, the fouls and the discipline issue.... Something needs to be done.
GameSack I love this guy rage )
GameSack I love this guy plz does anyone know his twitter
GameSack give united to giggsy DDD
GameSack Lets keep the faith, were not Aston Villa yet, we dont sack managers and besides what could Sir Ryan of Giggs do? Bulb the canteen lady?
GameSack He is right about the players not caring, there is no passion on the pitch apart from the few being darren fletcher, welbeck, rooney, but other than that the team just dont go together, no one wants to win the game..
GameSack There will be no improvement under david moyes, how anyone actually could believe that a man whose only achievement elwas keeping everton a mid table team was gonna improve the champions is beyonf me. SACK HIM NOW B4 THE DAMAGE IS 2 MUCH 2 BE UNDONE
GameSack van persaehhh tom clevelerlehhhh
GameSack Customize your message
GameSack This game we played different from any other game weve ever played. imo the best game in the second half ever under nick saban. sad to see mettenburger sacked 4xs but the tide was coming in and nothing gets in its way. Roll Tide Roll 2013 Nat. Champs!!!
GameSack Did the LSU offensive line just quit all together?
GameSack Was that road kill I saw
GameSack Les Miles was a dick for leaving him in there on 4th and impossible. What a goon.
GameSack wow we need to get rid of miles and replace the whole starting secondary. on the 55 yard td pass 10 men were playing man to man and jalen mills was playing zone. That is lack of awareness and prepariation. I give it up to the gumps for beating us.
GameSack More shades of the 1993 AuburnFlorida game where we sacked Heisman hopeful Wuerffel 3 times.
GameSack Id really like to hear Dave Souths call of this
GameSack Fired in the LAX parking lot
GameSack Hes definitely unique in the way he goes about his business. Not surprised he got his marching orders.
