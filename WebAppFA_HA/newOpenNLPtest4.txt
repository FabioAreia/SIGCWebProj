TopGear cool car, although I think a Wild Ferrari had sex with an Aventador, giving birth to what is the 6th Element. Weird. I still rather go for a TomCat and a Marauder for that kind of money.
TopGear 1,950,000 Pounds is about 2,500,000
TopGear This car is just amazing.
TopGear this beast has batman written all over it...
TopGear Thats Like a Car of A Demon
TopGear Looks like it already caught fire in the beginning of the video! HA!
TopGear The sound at the beginning should be the new sound for the Tardis
TopGear This is a very expensive track car, you could spend a million on a gtr to beat this and still have enough left over for a very nice daily driver
TopGear its gaiest lamorghini
TopGear Happy Birthday, Jeremy! :D
TopGear water pumps work wonders  PEACE
TopGear I remember this episode XD
TopGear still funny no matter how many times i watch
TopGear He who is last, shall be first...
TopGear Incompetent copresentersI lost it.
TopGear One of the funniest bits in tv history. :D
TopGear Interesting video.Thanks!
TopGear My god, that Singer is gorgeous! Anyone who would take the new one doesnt know the world beautiful.
TopGear I have a question, is it possible to drive a old car like a porsche 911 on a typical road? or just is possible to drive on a circuit
TopGear As it seems its a drivers 911. Love it !
TopGear Oh god not another porche lol :D
TopGear I love this car but its damn pricy
TopGear music 0:35???? pliss.
TopGear Super awesome job with the new 911 Porsche! Keep up the good work guys
TopGear An exeptional work for classic enthusiasts indeed, but...maybe, to be honest, in this car not a single crew is made by Porsche..and thats sounds foolish for a Porsche. Btw I like it so much!
TopGear that japanese laugh though lol
TopGear pfft I could do that :D
TopGear top gear japan anyone?
TopGear I respect how much love the producers show to DJ Shadow when picking music.Quality tracks.
TopGear Holden Manaro you mean!
TopGear awesomecheck my clip pleaseAUDI QUATTRO 2.7 TWIN TURBO 250BHP SOUNDS AWESOME
TopGear Dom can drift better then that...
TopGear Kazama is one of the best
TopGear personally I find american muscle cars easier to drift with than japanese modified ones because american muscle cars produce alot of wheelspin and have no traction control so u can just brake and turn in the wheels in the opposite direction your going just like in pixars cars turn right to go left
TopGear sounds like a 2014 f1 car
TopGear Jesse James needs to drag race his Monster Garage Mustang lawn mower against this, hahahah
TopGear I wish they wouldnt have tried to make this so inspirational. Almost made it not watchable.
TopGear I see it now, Top gear presents... the Honda Mean Mower Race.
TopGear 2 words... Mario Kart
TopGear how fast is that outside of middle earth
TopGear Im gonna mow the shit out of your lawn
TopGear Next goal. 200kmh on a mower. Go.
TopGear Damn such a privilege I bet lots of super car owners out there are jealous on you
TopGear Chris Goodwin, Mclaren Chief Test Driven takes us on a hot lap at the TopGear tes track. INSANITY happens!
TopGear Amazing!!! Since the MP412C has done it in 1.16,2 sec., then I guess, it made it in 1.12,6!!
TopGear DoctaM3 I bet this was such a breath taking experience! As always, very good work. Did you have the opportunity to drive it around the track as well?
TopGear How does it compare to the Huayra?
TopGear Hi toyota, where can I purchase 3 landcruisers asap? Coming from overseas
TopGear I would get the fishing rods out if I was on the Avon.
TopGear one of my favourites, just cant stop laughing!
TopGear lol, Back to the studio
TopGear YOU PILLOCK!!!!! lol.
TopGear USA tried to copy uks tv shows and fail epically they are just useless at being funny oh and making cars haha
TopGear Its compressed air not pure oxygen lol
TopGear Still the best Television series ever.
TopGear reminds me on toyota g86 and subaru brz
TopGear Who in their right mind would buy this over a Ferrari or Lamborghini?
TopGear Is this like some persons filmedit reel to get hired for top gear production? Here is a hint, put more story into it
TopGear only 6 mph faster than a gtr but 4 times the price, gtr wins again on value.....
TopGear Wheres the Under the Hood part.
TopGear was told by title under the hood, so watched for under the hood view.. I was dooped
TopGear Beautiful. Just beautiful.
TopGear One of my all time FAVOURITE cars.... its like a little rocket ship and screams up to 9500 rpm,,just a pure best..and also is one of Jeremy Clarksons fav cars   many things are wrong with it but its still the BEST car iv ever driven
TopGear can we toss top gear USA out in front of the bulls and let them get run over?
TopGear and thats why top gear U.S. version sucks ass. Hammond had the balls to go into the bull event. No American Top Gear Hollywood Attention whore would have the guts to do what Hammond did. Thumbs up for U.K. Top Gear!
TopGear Better than the terrible Top Gear US that they play here in the states.
TopGear Hammond should called lambo lover
TopGear Aphex Twin Window Licker
TopGear Just by looking at the title, I thoguht Hammond was going to drive the Lambo in the Bull Run.
TopGear 3.9 sec to 60 the zr1 does it in 3.3 and the z06 in 3.5 even the gt500 is faster
TopGear why didnt the lamborghini changed that roof converting process?
TopGear Grande ottimo lavoro!!!Ma oltre alle puntate vecchie, metterai anche la ventunesima stagione?:)
TopGear Ci crediate o no, io quel giorno ero a Piazza di Spagna con mia moglie, ed ho assistito a tutta la scena...la cosa bislacca  che NON LI CONOSCEVO ANCORA e mi sono avvicinato credendo fosse un film....ora a rivederli.....fantastici
TopGear How come weve never seen the Stig and his cousin in the same place?
TopGear nice try but i am not downloading your stupid app.
TopGear 0:30 mine favorite place to play Race The Stig.
TopGear I played this game before this video xD
TopGear Some say that he borrowed a lot of money to study art history and that he hasnt found employment for years...all we know is hes call The Stigs teenage cousin!
TopGear Fake..Im the onliest Stig
TopGear non riesco a vederla intera, mi si blocca sui 10 min
TopGear 0:46 Brakuje tylko strzaw i palenia gumy )
TopGear 1:56 totally fell for it. gotta love Mercedes
TopGear Jeremy is perhaps the best presenter in the world imop..
TopGear and it beats the petrol powered car?
TopGear Oil in brunei cost 0.53BND per litre, thats 0.407USD. Diesel is way cheaper at 0.30BND per litre, so its around 0.230USD. 1 litre of water bottle cost either 0.50BND or 1.00BND. So thats 0.38USD or 0.769USD.
TopGear Im sorry but that Mercedes is ugly. I prefer the sleek body lines of a Corvette or a Lambo.
TopGear And now its has 20 battery left... Gotta plug it into a wall charger
TopGear yeees yeees, it iiiiis feature
TopGear 6:30 Superliminal  Deadmau5 333
TopGear expensive, impractical or whatnot, this is just another step towards the oil solution
TopGear Top Gear 20x05 ITA HD Seconda Parte
TopGear grazie per i video! sei un grande
TopGear 0100 in 6 secondi? Lhanno confusa con uno scooter :D ?
TopGear Blue convertible went past my bus stop today, so nice
TopGear Woh! a Gold GTR. thats little crazy!
TopGear This car is breathtaking...but is way overpriced at 195000 pounds
TopGear Someone knows the song ?
TopGear umm, it has 565 hp, not 517 hp
TopGear 5.9L V12 but I still love it.
TopGear lol sigla di assassins creed e grazie x queste puntate, continua cosi
TopGear comparing these two cars is like comparing a sprinter that runs 100m races to someone who runs 8000m races
TopGear You guys hate on America to much
TopGear lol 1:55 you can see a part of the race before the race actually happens (mustang behind the sign). GG editing. Not bashing, just pointing it out. love this show.
TopGear Its an unfair comparison, and they really played it off like it was a challenge and a glorious victory for the Lotus, which is what makes me mad. Oh and that comment at the end about using this test to justify British cars being better the American cars.
TopGear did u guys use the smallest mustang motor u could find wtf???
TopGear LOTUS  Lots Of Trouble Usually Serious (for other cars) :)
TopGear That Hotel California BGM.
TopGear This is a joke, a go cart with a supercharger against a four seater mustangenough said. Well,except for the wimpy 4.6 ford engine is in a heavy chassispound for pound, a very poor comparison indeed.
TopGear Sei mitico! Oltre a condividere il link dei tuoi video ho fatto conoscere il tuo canale alla mia classe , seguono ogni tuo video :)
TopGear Pubblica tutto quello che hai su top gear ita anche le serie precedenti ogni video hai un like assicurato da parte mia grandeeee
TopGear sei un grande....altro che d max...stanno ancora alla 18..posso scaricare anche le puntate da qua o hai un link? grazieee
TopGear One of the best fucking passes I have ever seen i wanna see him and dia yoshara have a a match on this track and see who wins.
TopGear I sorta expected them to just dip the tent into the river, before actually lifting it ashore.
TopGear I would buy the Mclaren in a heartbeat...
TopGear Haha when jeremy is driving uts the ac3 theme D
TopGear I too would take the ferrari
TopGear assassins creed 3 music lol
TopGear Nobody expects the Spanish speed hump
TopGear Honestly Ill take...XKRS caz I think its the most brutal..And the best looking..
TopGear That is a dirty, dirty sound...
TopGear This was some creepy stuff.
TopGear Hey Jeremy that bloke that got his gentleman sausage cut off and thrown out of the window of a speeding car, on the A1 should take a trip to Russia so he can grow a new one! See your show really is educational and provides public service announcements!Good on ya crack on mate!
TopGear after the socalled Christmas Special (aired in the spring, lol), when will the show continue?
TopGear Best... Show... Ever...
TopGear They have the best job in the world!
TopGear Michael Schumacher as stig :)
TopGear can you put up season 21 in Australia please

TopGear i think im in love with her lol
TopGear Say burglar alarm in scottish accent
TopGear Girl, Please stop talking cause I will go crazy if u keep talking. my god love your accent.
TopGear She has a great taste in cars!
TopGear People these arent her cars. This isnt her garage. Those are the cars for Top Gear Live, a stage show that they do in the UK. That is why it is a big tent and not a building.
TopGear So weird to watch the lap without jeremys voice, aaand across the line !
TopGear cool guy and he knows how to drive.. nice!
TopGear Why Aaron Paul doesnt drive meth lab on wheels on Top Gear track ?
TopGear 2:14 he forgot the reducing agent
TopGear you do know when referring to driving it is spelt Braking right?, i am hoping it is a play on words
TopGear NeedForSpeed is now showing in theaters everywhere! But first, check out the BTS clip of Aaron Paul taking the Top Gear Test Track.Watch: Is Aaron Paul Bad at Breaking?  Top Gear  Series 21  Behind the Scenes
TopGear Are you proud ? (queen hello hand)
TopGear Saw that Need for Speed movie yesterday. It was Awesome!
TopGear Supercar Runway Race  Top Gear  Series 20 BBC
TopGear I hope they do this with interesting cars in the future. The McLaren is sick, but the R8 and 458 are the most generic supercars ever.
TopGear I mean most of them in that fact......yes hurried and corrected my self haha
TopGear Why didnt they buy an aventador
TopGear anyone else cringe when Clarkson was leaning up against the McLaren with his jeans on?
TopGear aventador roadster xD manual roof lol
TopGear Those cars can reach VR of most planes.
TopGear Top Gear 19x04 ITA HD Seconda Parte
TopGear Continua like in tutti i video si grande

TopGear sad about MAS crash in Vietnam
TopGear FAKE! Touch screens dont work with gloves

TopGear stigs are rampant. cousins everywhere
TopGear Such a good advertisement.
TopGear il bellissimo top gear si rivedr su Dmax il10 marzo alle ore 21:10stagione 19 (W TOP GEAR)
TopGear Zapraszamy na spacer z redaktorem naczelnym polskiej edycji TopGear Szymonem Sotysikiem po salonie samochodowym w Genewie. Zobaczcie subiektywn list najciekawszych premier.WICEJ O GENEVA MOTOR SHOW 2014 NA TG:http:www.topgear.com.plgenewamotorshow2014najciekawszepremierydo,aktualnosci,artykuly,3637
TopGear Im not so concerned with rhe Rulebook on top speed either. But come on... First the SSC Aero which quickly turned out to be a homewelded steel tubular kitcar based on a Lambo Diablo replica kit. And now the Hennessey Venom GT which is built in England, modded in England and still running on Lotus paperwork, Lotus VIN  Chassis number and Lotus numberplates. Which is the only way its road legal at all. So please... Derek... Doesnt it ever get embarrassing to adopt modded Euro cars as american car icons. Such as the Ford GT40, AC Cobra.Wouldnt you like to see the might and manpower of the entire US of Murcas car industry, step up and actually BE competitive instead of just claim to be with kitcars and tuner projects ?
TopGear How can the Venom be the fastest production car when its a stretched Lotus with a twin turbo charged V8? Granted its nice work though Hennessey could have done better by designing a car of their own besides taking a proven product along with a second attempt at this body style .
TopGear demander11 same here the Nismo GTR is an ugly tuner car the 911 Turbo is a beautiful car
TopGear I think its gonna be a ff franchise
TopGear The price is  3,500,000.00
TopGear The one sold for 2 million each
TopGear The Koenigsegg 1t1 was ordered and built as a track car and not some tuning project like the Venom seems to be. The new technologies developed for the 1t1 will also go into the next gen Agera model. It even has 3D printed titanium parts to save weight. (And the 3D printing technology comes from another swedish company with customers such as Airbus, Boeing and NASA)Do not underestimate us swedes :)Cant wait to see some videos of the 1t1!
TopGear I dont want NFS to go on nor do I think it will. AP doesnt have the philanthropical good guy charm that helped Mr. Walker win us over. Plus I think we need to go back to the lighter car porn movie era and leave behind the in your face every car desired ever xxx fest that plagues car movies currently.
TopGear That was the stupidest comment I have ever seen
TopGear zrbcie na lato test golfa r porsche 911s i moe jeszcze co mocniejszego np. ferrari 458 aby pokaza na torze jaka jest rnica prdkoci i czasw i jakie wspaniae osigi moe mie auto za 155000z w porwnaniu do super samochodw za grubo ponad 500000z i miliona zotych
TopGear Piers bashing makes me feel all happy inside.
TopGear I always imagine The Stig smiling up to both ears under the helmet after going for a few rounds
TopGear Look at that little car hip hopping on the track. Id drive with a megawatt smile.
TopGear The stig seems a feminine this time. Chest at 1:15, lock of blonde hair at 1:27
TopGear Watching the lap in 1080p is glorious!
TopGear Please do the lap again in the dry! This was going to be exciting!
TopGear James has had a girlfriend for the past 14 years.
TopGear 1:15 does the stig has boobs?
TopGear Haha, Id love to see someone go on Forza 5 and use the Ceterham on the Top Gear track and trie to beat his time!
TopGear Love it, would trade my Audi A4 for a left hand drive Caterham 620r any day :)
TopGear Non so come ringraziarti di aver messo le puntate di Top Gear! Per la prossima hai gi unidea quando caricarla?
TopGear They did this already with the Porsche from the show. TG content is so second rate.
TopGear Crazy stuff Top Gear!! I love it!! LOL
TopGear this is some abstract trippy stuff. whats Jeremy Clarkson on?
TopGear i think it looks pretty!
TopGear This needs to be on tv in the us
TopGear Garrys Mod in real life.
TopGear I think its kinda stupid to do such a show in front of bunch of people.. They are best at making Top Gear which is watched all over the world from millions of people. The best show in the world :)
TopGear OMG!!! i wanna see once in my lifeeee!!!! :(pls come to italyyyyyy
TopGear it is wet but not wild
TopGear Swimming pool at the end lol
TopGear The Vauxhall Astra techline
TopGear Please upload last topgears news section. 3
TopGear Thats in Dubai. Someone has a ram version of that, its a house
TopGear I think Ill just watch it in English LOL!
TopGear Im French,but i used to watch the French version,but not anymore,i simply cant get back to it,the English version is the best,end of story
TopGear I dont know what channel it must be on. But I would die to watch Top Gear UK here in the US
TopGear If you think that spanish is fast you should come visit where I live. Or just listen to spanish radio
TopGear Turkish voice actors are terrible! In every movie they are always the same and they pronounce very strange.... German and original are the best! Spanish and more spanish sound very funny and I wonder why they need 1000 words to say somethink very eazy xD
TopGear Spanish from Spanien sucks and the other lenguages too. I prefer just in english with subtitles.
TopGear I dont know, but the Hungarian version has a very similar voice for Jeremy. I havent seen this version.
TopGear happy to be norwegian... nothing is dubbed
TopGear it looks like it belongs in a mass effect game, its awesome
TopGear I believe the solution would be a helmet.
TopGear face like a ball bag!
TopGear Come ride this in Mauritius 95 Sun all year long!
TopGear Im french but I love it !!!
TopGear you didnt drive her during perfect road trip
TopGear My bladders gone! Its completely gone! Ive wet myself.
TopGear My goodness, Jeremy, please wash your teeth, theyre pretty much yellow!!!
TopGear Italian 3english still the best
TopGear I am German but I never watch this in my own language, I like the original English version.By the way, Hammond in Spanish is best.
TopGear spanish sounds like crazy frog
TopGear I couldnt stand watching top gear in non english
TopGear TopGear has been dubbed in pretty much every language around the world.
TopGear Dubbing is the Work of Satan.
TopGear There are several translations into Castellano... two dubbers for each in Spain, as well as the Spanish American version...
TopGear Scandinavia, probably the only place where we do not dub shows or movies... in the woooorld.
TopGear The spanish of jammond is best xD
TopGear Common point: All translations are awful.
TopGear Original voices are the best...in Mexico we love this show...jajajaja....no hard feelings
TopGear hahahahaha Spanish was like real hamster :D
TopGear The song when Jeremy first drives the Mono is First Warning by The Prodigy.PROTIP Google search Top Gear songs and click on the link to the FinalGear forums, they have a complete listing of each episodes soundtrack.
TopGear Just sayin Gforce has very little to do with whats happening to Jezzas face in this clip.
TopGear Why dont the people who engineer these cars think Hey, why dont we put a cockpit type windshield on the car? Kind of like a fighter jet?Surely they can make one that doesnt weigh that much...
TopGear Driving without a helmet and then making an issue of his face going south. I suppose he has to cater for the wider audience. A well prepared professional wouldnt do it.
TopGear Check out this video on YouTube:
TopGear the future of FORMULA 1
TopGear Question: for a fun racing car with a decent engine and open world experience, why should i pay 100k for the Mono when i can buy an Ariel for less than half?Im kinda missing the comparison between both here.
TopGear How fast have all these tracked at
TopGear Ummm, ya know, like. uhh, sort of, you know....YOU KNOW WHAT!? I DONT BLAME THEN GUY, SO PISS OFF ALL YOU YABOS
TopGear Everyone Above and Below meloves topgear
TopGear I lost interest at about 1:30
TopGear You know 23times in 3:30min You know!
TopGear So he is the producer.
TopGear Blimey young bloke,,you know..playin,had to do it YOU KNOW!
TopGear And dont you just wish you could drive a tenth as well as those people can! I DO!!!
TopGear how comes european fords are better than american fords....that shouldnt be right should it?
TopGear FORD FOCUS RS!MY FAVOURITE CAR!MY DREAM CAR!
TopGear come fai a pubblicarli senza avere contestazioni per il copyright
TopGear He seems like a chill dude.
TopGear its rainy but our spirits are not dampened hah
TopGear there should have been some thunder and lightning in this scene
TopGear right sided driving ?!!!!
TopGear fake Loki drives a jaguar duhh
TopGear Loki is cool. He just is.
TopGear Why isnt the assistant producer a presenter? Hes better than the current ones...
TopGear they NEED chris hemsworth!
TopGear One of my favourite TopGear races. With the Ford Shelby GT500 vs The EurostarTGV in first obviously
TopGear i wish someday toyota will make a super car. like the nissan GTR. just something equivalent to it. toyota is slowly getting out of the market race to me. the 2014 models are just shit!!
TopGear Take a look at this video on YouTube:
TopGear They call it 90 mile beach because its exactly 55 miles long.
TopGear James May is working! xD
TopGear Look at the sand around the flag 7:08 vs 7:37
TopGear What do you mean fastest car in the world?
TopGear This is called 90 mile beach because it is exactly 55 miles long Oh Jeremy, y u so funny
TopGear SO the Stig do talk... with Norwegian accent... hmmmm
TopGear Surely the Norwegian accent bit was a red herring, just like all of the Some Say intros.
TopGear Hugh is like an older version of Dan Hardcastle
TopGear Super Light Cars and Ryan Ellis on Gearzput the Stig in this.
TopGear He was joking about the accent, otherwise they wouldnt have let it in.
TopGear Da dove le prendi le puntate?? :D
TopGear i would love to believe a certain brit filmed this, a certain superhero, Vav, i hope you filmed this
TopGear Who is the chick!!! She can light me up any day!!!
TopGear REST IN PEACE PAUL WALKER 3
TopGear Porsches in flames? Too soon junior!
TopGear Well heck Top Gear, if youve got spare Porsche 911s to set fire to, you could alternatively give them to me?
TopGear Why use a 911 when you can use a nonmodified Gallardo? HAHA WINKWINKNUDGENUDGESMILE
TopGear I brought some brats!
TopGear pointless waste,i used to like top gear,now all i see is ego fueled presenters who get paid for thrashing,destroying cars people in the REAL world could only dream of owning,its gone from being a fantastic show which was informative to this show of meaningless excuse of entertainment
TopGear I imagine the thought process behind this went something like, Cars and women are too mainstream. Lets do cars, women and FIRE! Thatll knock em dead!
TopGear ghost riders, porsche
TopGear So if your car is all of a suddenly ambushed by a flame throwing lady while your driving on your Porsche 911 you just start doing donuts.what happened to stop drop and roll
TopGear I used to bike a lot before my bad feet, but some of the people I see out there nowadays makes me want to atomic wedgie their stupid lycra pants.
TopGear MOTORISTS. RED AND GREEN.LEARN THE BLOODY DIFFERENCE.
TopGear Stupid idiot English cavemen. Bikes and cars are not the same. Build bike paths. Learn the bloody difference!It doesnt matter if you go through red or green. You will be killed anyhow no matter how fucking green the light is.
TopGear Funny cause its true.
TopGear Yeah, learn it lycrawearinghippies
TopGear Being both a cyclist and a car driver, I cannot agree more with this public safety announcement by Top Gear (copyright BBC).Top Gear Bicycle Advert
TopGear Funny... Every time I hear about a bicyclist being injured at a controlled intersection, its because a CAR ran the red light. Every damn time.
TopGear Soooo which wire was it again?
TopGear I wish all cyclists got blown up to be honest.
TopGear Love Top Gear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear Shouldnt there be someone in a white fire suit in the background, with a fedora on top of his white helmet? That would be Agent S. (Some say he works for an organization without a cool name. All we know is...)
TopGear Two of my favorite shows (Top Gear and Phineas and Ferb) in one?? MUST WATCH FULL EPISODE!!!
TopGear irgendwie hrt man dem typ verdammt gerne zu...
TopGear Richard Hamdon und James May  Captian Slow
TopGear Spot on  well done Top Gear!
TopGear Car drivers that concern you too look both sides anyway dont assume i cant see anything its clear in evry secound you can hit a kid who runs on street do you really want to be a child killer becouse you was to cocksure you have clear path?
TopGear This has to be Archies all time best rant. LOL funny all the way.
TopGear nice archie! great video
TopGear Agree  Best video yet. Judgemental Archie at his very best. Thank You !
TopGear Loud, obnoxious Clarkson, hahaha that is the most hypocritical thing I have ever heard in my life. Strangely enough I agree with you Archie about the quality of the magazine as it was terrible but the way you go about saying it is childish and further proves to me that you are a pompous, undereducated fat prick who spends all of his money on second hand watches and begging for cash on Youtube because he has lost his job as a Waste disposal manager (essentially a bin man).
TopGear GREAT point at the end there, Archie. Top Gears gone to the shitter.
TopGear Jeremy Clarkson is too busy making fun of Piers Morgan getting fired to care about some watch book. Besides I think Ive seen Jezza wearing a Omega most of the time on top gear.
TopGear Yeah this was already out
TopGear Its amusing how the voices are sped up just enough to make them all sound ... adolescent. :)
TopGear Why all video quality so shitty? Either the image is off focus, the sound is too high of low pitched or both
TopGear Why is this such a crap recording with crap sound and visual noise all over it?
TopGear The roads in Burma are bad enough, never mind having Fisher Price roads that baby children have made!
TopGear haha James: auauauau D
TopGear Jeremy looks so funny on horse with a tie and all :DD
TopGear I feel bad for the horses..
TopGear Jesus....I mean Buddha :DDD
TopGear the only fucking reason he thinks they should be glue, is because the horse isnt a horse, its a pony and he could fucking flatten it cause hes too fucking big for it!
TopGear goddd ,me laughin like an idiot,,and my dad,,,,,is like what the fuck are you doing!!!!,,,,,and offcourse me laughin moree and moree
TopGear lol their PSAs were hilarious. topgear is the best
TopGear topgear awesomeness :D
TopGear hahahaha! napaka antipatiko lang talaga e
TopGear I like Jeremy and James had the clothing tags on their jackets, still.
TopGear Whats the name of the song of Jeremys clip?
TopGear Like how they kept the tags on so they could return them :)
TopGear 4:40 everybody..i just cant XD ...breath!
TopGear 1:20 what did Jeremy say?
TopGear Seen the whole series......better than season 20
TopGear What a damn tease! When are you assholes ganna start uploading whole episodes like everyone knows you should?! FUCK!
TopGear Do they buy trucks that are nearly broken on purpose so they can complain about them?
TopGear What kind of old isuzus are clarkson and Hammond driving? I suspect old TY series trucks but Im not sure
TopGear music music music music....concert of music.......
TopGear BBCTopGear Mobility Scooters: Great Moments with RichardHammond http:youtu.beKrZcEzCKNo8

TopGear Lol..dubai has lambo taxi.
TopGear Hahahahaha lol Taxi ? TAXI !
TopGear 8 speed automatic.... EEEWWWW! What the hell! Wheres the stick and clutch? You losing your touch Stigie?
TopGear Its not a real Stig. Real Stig would have listened to Chineese language lesson or something...
TopGear i havent seen the dragster on youtube yet :(
TopGear Why is everyone crying? Theyre not stopping and there will be a season 22
TopGear Ahhaha. Very good. Also get fat!
TopGear Jeremy is dead...anyways xD
TopGear The trouble in Ukraine was cause by top gear and top gear only... Its Syria all over again
TopGear Whats the song at 6:43 ?
TopGear HalfLife 3 Confirmed by James May.
TopGear Aww dacia sandero, luv you May
TopGear Good news! The Dacia Sandero.
TopGear Why not just shift into neutral and rev pointlessly for hours?
TopGear Great video, as always from Top Gear!! And I want a Fiesta like Hammonds!!
TopGear I LOVE the sound of those 3 Cylinders!!!!!!! Almost like a inline 6, but half. That volkswagen has got good potential. I love the sound of it
TopGear Surprised they didnt give Hammster a 5pt harness. The man is truly fearless (remembering the Nardo run in the Noble as well)!
TopGear 1:20 music? I know Ive heard it before.
TopGear the empty quarter is in saudi arabi
TopGear ive got the suv version of that
TopGear 0:54 the car has 6 wheels but the diff switches show 4 wheels?
TopGear only now i know what is my dream .. this and f12 . i dont want more !
TopGear nice car. the video makes it better than it is.
TopGear I NEED IT EHEHUEHUHEUHEHEUHEUHEUHEUHUEHEHUEHUEHUEHEUHEUHUEHEUHEUHEUHEUHEUHEUHEUHEUE
TopGear That was in Las Vegas not Reno
TopGear I guess hes never seen the 6 wheeled cars that used to race at Indy. 4 steering wheels in front and 2 drive wheels in back. Looked weird, but cornered great.
TopGear Weird how Dodge made a concept 6x6 and when the German company bought them said it wouldnt be viable, pointless and no one would want it....now they make this...bs all the way! Good looking though
TopGear 1:05 the Stig has skin!
TopGear I love the autoblip when he or she down shifts .
TopGear Work Harder. Get a Car.
TopGear Just finished watching this, it was brilliant :D
TopGear I prefer these ones when they get cheap basic vehicles and go around the UKWorld doing challenges, I find new superhyper cars a bit boring and the guest in the reasonably priced car! lol.
TopGear They should do one across Australia next.
TopGear Have you been enjoying the Top Gear Unseasonable Seasonal special?
TopGear Anyone know when this is airing or if it has been aired yet?
TopGear Part 2 of this Burma Special..excellent beyond thoughts!! never have I laughed as much as I have tonight!! Top Gear is the best show...........................................................In the world! :D :D
TopGear Have to say, I really enjoy the Stigseyeview of a lap. You really get the idea of how hard ol Stiggie works, especially on a wet lap like that one was, as well as the line he takes and how he sets up.Grazie, Top Gear.
TopGear That steering wheel is ugly as hell.
TopGear Looks like a crossbreed between an R8 and an ISF.
TopGear Vaya coche... es inconducible
TopGear An RPM gauge and speedo would make this cooler. Also in the turns it looks like he pulling Gs lol
TopGear As Big, Daft, Orange monsters go that is a big one.But it looks so great.
TopGear That thing is a handful. Id like to see a dry lap.
TopGear This sounds familiar.... I dont know why
TopGear Ah yes Top Gear a British tv show about cars and they used a song from Mass Effects soundtrack. We have dismissed this claim.
TopGear I think most of the people who came here are Mass Effect fans. like myself :D
TopGear Most of the music from Top gear and Mass effect is called Stock Music. Basically music that is made for general use with cheap licences
TopGear Where is the full video??
TopGear Dubai Police Need for Speed.
TopGear Crikey! Its the Arabic rozzers!
TopGear Yeah why not spend some money on a bit more classy uniforms as well, no?
TopGear the thing is that its never going to work with an automobile because they pull to the side. the trick to doing the trick is to pull the tablecloth down.
TopGear Stupid and borong show. A rave between two vehicles that noone actiually bys to race. Bloody idiots
TopGear How much is that jet skicar?
TopGear I cant wait to see what happened next
TopGear Jeremys film knowledge is pretty good, recreating that scene from the spy who loved me where Roger Moore speeds to Atlantis on a jet ski
TopGear Who else notices the Ferrari 360 on 3:15???
TopGear The 4C is simply a Diamond! Love Alfa Romeo!
TopGear Finalmente, inizia con gli cinesi al posto degli inglesi. Aspettiamo con onore la 18 stagione. Top Gear
TopGear anybody know the soundtrack
TopGear Ok, ferrari is a super car. A little old, but still a nice supercar. But the porsche and especially that HUMMER? I would rather go by bus, which is maybe faster and more fuel efficient then that useless hummer.
TopGear Uhh... are H3s considered exotic in Europe? I drive a H3x Alpha (with almost 100hp more than the I5 version in this video) as a daily driver and I would call it the antithesis of supercar. I love it, Ive owned two, but even I dont think its anything worth getting excited about. Haha. Very strange to me to see it highlighted like this. But thats cool I guess! Maybe Im spoiled.
TopGear I hope there is gonna be a Top gear Romania
TopGear This was seriously the funniest episode yet! I couldnt breathe from laughter. :D
TopGear Lovely. Ill take one, please.
TopGear And another good new...Alfa is preparing a hotter version with 2.0 liters engine and about 320 hp.
TopGear Whats with the crazy colors? Does the Stig see differently than us humans?
TopGear Doesnt look that clean of a lap.
TopGear Grandeeeeee 4C la miglioreee, fai vedere agli inglesi che lAlfa non  morta
TopGear I thought it was just americans, but do british too honestly belive their army is protecting them by being in the middle east?
TopGear Why does Hammond look really sinister and evil with that beard?
TopGear that looks hella fun where can i buy one
TopGear We need a bigger lighter
TopGear I love Hammonds What at the end
TopGear Ah christ his whispery voice during that last bit just killed me.
TopGear kissing the screen atm O
TopGear I dont think I have ever seen Bill Murray laugh that much
TopGear I just love Bill Murrays uncontrollable laughing  that alone would have set me off even if I didnt know what the joke was.
TopGear This was one of the funniest episodes of graham norton ever.
ZONEofTECH Yeah, I figured out that I wasnt a fully partner a couple of days ago. It seems that I need more subscribers to become a full partner. And yes, I agreed with Googles terms and conditions which forbade me to say what my earnings are. :)
ZONEofTECH ok i will thrust you! your hot lol
ZONEofTECH Who the firetruck can dislike a God of War video? :(
GameSack ladest du auch das spiel mit anivia hoch???
GameSack 1131, had to bust out the calculator for that one i see
GameSack You spend too much time on this... and you get no results... Stop youtube its worth it.
GameSack lol hes comparing the range of malphites ult to zacs E
GameSack Malphite ult actually knocks people up and disables them, Zac is just jumping around doing small amounts of damage.
GameSack ehm dyrus TPA stanley nasus jayce yorick swain irelia skins free wait those tags aint even...
GameSack Ziggs has carried this tf imo.
GameSack Wanna play a game. Wait 1 sec. BOOM.

GameSack from 141 to 641 in 3 seconds
GameSack that is just like omg. This guy has some epic luck. He just went in and whacked them to death.
GameSack By the way there really is no perfect guide for any champ, really you have to analyze the enemy team and counterbuild with your items.
GameSack U gonna do a dr.MUNDO
GameSack now thats a big Cockroach (ChoGath)
GameSack Note: This video was made in 2010 maybe it reduced dmg genius ...
GameSack And then there was Veigar.
GameSack beep, blurp. beep, blurp. beep, blurp. Its the sound of you not having friends to play LoL with.
GameSack Too bad it doesnt work like that anymore, laser turret does true damage or something now.... op
GameSack i can only understand the first 2 words
GameSack I guess Jimmy is the hater here...on his own video...
GameSack My thoughts exactly. Those good old days.
GameSack You know, three archangels, zhonyas ring, lich bane and rylais scepter would be so much better to put on veigar? I had 1200 AP and that was rape.
GameSack Amazing how good players fail using hotkeys. And wow, listening to your voice one gets the feeling you are dead  no emotions whatsoever.
GameSack are you guys talking on a fucking walkie talkie?????
GameSack If you used it, you would have lived btw at 1:30 maybe? (terribad grammar right there. RELEASE THE GRAMMAR NAZIS)
GameSack except of pantheon everyone was a tank ...
GameSack hristo7777 It only takes 1 noob feeder...
GameSack jongreenepwns q will at least add more ability power per champion kill
GameSack omfg this pantheon trying to backdoor scene shows how crappy u are. why not hit with cage? O not that hard? no you let him kill ur turret... great play :D NOT
GameSack 20 stacks means that you play good. So anybody with negative comments shut the fuck up and upload your better pro videos. Thanks.
GameSack i just played against a veigar with 1008 AP!?!?! fcking unbelivable, he had 3 archangel a zhoynas and boots and another ap item ( dont remember) i had 200 magic res and his dark matter hit for 781!... he raped our team..
GameSack War ein lustiges Spiel P
TopGear dont copy achivment hunter
TopGear AR12Gaming how the f does tom have so much money, love the vid btw
TopGear Have nick use the sail boat next time and have the whole route go directly through the map. No highways or ring roads. Also give Tom a slower car.
TopGear A golf club? How did he get a golf club?!
TopGear Great video, one suggestion: Music in cockpit? Renault R25 next?
TopGear So which one of you is Clarkson, and when can i punch you in the face?
TopGear Very nice. 1010 would drive
TopGear Woo, you should do some of their epic crazy trips )
TopGear I was really sad when this got taken down, because it was one of my favourite vids

TopGear Please do a review of entity (koenigsegg ccxr or Agari)
TopGear Would have been awesome and hilarious of they added the 3 wheeler Robin car from Top Gear :D
TopGear Hey all dlc cars are free no in game credit :)
TopGear Pfft.. People these things are remodelled! Brand new models, Id rather have new models than recycled crap... That Holden looks interesting, though. I will definitely be buying this pack.
TopGear Ferrari 458 speciale, Mclaren 650s, PORSCHE(911 turbo,911 gt3, Carrera gt, 918 spyder...) , Alfa Romeo 4c, BMW M4, Mercedes SLS Black, Ferrari California T, Koenigsegg One:1, Lamborghini Huracan, Corvette C7, Corvette Z06 C7, Camaro Z28, Jaguar FType V6 and V8 S, Aston Martin V12 Vantage S, Maserati Ghibli, Zonda R, Ferrari 599xx, FXX and others PLZ!!!!
TopGear T10,I understand that you have to remake every car, and that you arent just recycling or copy and pasting them.BUTIf you really do have to remake every car, why not make those cars new to the series? Whats the point of remaking cars that have already been driven by 7080 of people playing this game?Id actually buy DLC if it was new. So would a lot of people. And we all know that youre money whores  you and MS  so you should probably listen to your fans when its about DLC.I know that nothing will changed for the rest of FM5 DLC. All we can realistically do is hope that some sense is knocked into you in future games.
TopGear bring the 2000 Jaguar xk8xkr
TopGear Again cars that only should of been there in the beginning. Iracing is better a lot less cares but more excitement and real simulation
TopGear No C7 corvette.....dropping the ball turn 10.
TopGear Could you please also remodel the drivers needed for using Fanatec Wheels? I mean, if this is about bringing all the stuff we liked about FM4, you might as well let us use the wheels. Otherwise you still wont be getting my money.
TopGear I thought this was Top Gear Pack?! Wheres my Hammerhead iEagle Thrust.

TopGear How do you get so many credits?
TopGear Yooo nick AR12 Gaming whats your twitch name
TopGear You should do best noise
TopGear And the demolition derby?

TopGear Loving these, hope you keep going with these!
TopGear Next episode: Plane vs Car to top of Mount Chiliad (or however you spell it) Although, you should make it harder for the plane.
TopGear You should seek for the best road in LS and Blaine County. Love your videos BTW:)
TopGear I got an alright challenge idea for you topgear presenters buy test and prove that you can get a good car for 16,000 or less I only ask as im interested to see what you guys pick to help me choose a reasonably priced car thats 16,000 or less cause I cant decide and I think you guys would be able to make an awsome episode from it not that all of em arent awsome :) but yeah just throwing the idea out there
TopGear Can u use the ford f250
TopGear This is on Xbox One only, right? I ask because it looks like they improved the handling mechanics over previous games.
TopGear When you twerked in the beggining you used alot of tourqe so would it be tourqed?
TopGear HEY Nick i joined ur gta5 online crew!

TopGear I thought it was top gear but all I get to see is a lame ass game
TopGear I love the original game and find it very enjoyable and have to say I need this s I gotta be honest I totally prefer the street car racing over rallying! Also as you said its a fantastic looking game, off to Ebay I say! lol
TopGear they could make money off the name if they decided to make a game for ps4 or the new nintendo
TopGear Looks smart, another reason why I need to reacquire an N64.
TopGear This game was pretty good for a racing game on the n64 the backrounds of the tracks did look pretty good great review glenn
TopGear Hi I wud like to play with you guys
TopGear Np ahah copier questa tua risposta in futuro hihi popolo del tubo svegliatevi che c una ragazza che merita veramente!!
GameSack PLEASE MAKE IT 10 hours
GameSack Try looking at soundcloud, it should be at leagueoflegends. If its not, maybe Riot will put it up there sometime soon. If not, you could have found it in the location I indicated in the description of this video (this only applies to when the login screen was present though).
GameSack Man this brings up memories, there was sooo much hype around this. S3 championship is gonna be awesome too if riot uses this kind of music, builds up so much hype.
GameSack I was so happy aft kill khaz and getting the victory buff
GameSack watch?vYYgmdhsrPu4 Thats where Riot took the idea. Im laughing so hard.
GameSack Rengar is inspired by washing machine.
GameSack here mousy mousy mousy
GameSack thank you from Canada :D
GameSack Hans Zimmer is good...
GameSack beginning kinda sounds like POTC for a second. :P
GameSack What happens to this channel I cant find it anywhere
GameSack Steve is so hilariously crazy at the end xD
GameSack the new thumbnails look really unattractive to click on
GameSack Is Collective Digital Studio something like Makers Studio?
GameSack MadProps4U will look into it now.
GameSack Julia Nunes (Jaaaaaaa) did the kickstarter thing. In the end, she was really successful with it! :)
GameSack TheWillofDC i didnt notice the music until i read this comment
GameSack youtubers are always whoring around for thumbs up, favorite, subs,etc. which is fair since that it their job after all, what riot did was a smart move, since the game is free they got to earn money off other stuff. also i think maybe it got people on youtube which is always a nice thing. i doubt all those subscribers had an account and didnt joined their website before. now grab a random youtuber and see the ending of one video... follow me,like me, feed me,etc.
GameSack Y U NO talk about theneedledrop winning On The Rise? It was such a close competition!
GameSack Is Jenna Marbles that good?
GameSack she said mario right the canadian way thats how italians say it and its an italian name you americans are saying it wrong :P
GameSack eznoob1v1 Yes, he is openly gay.
GameSack So many YouTubers with over 1,000,000 subscribers..... Man this place grew since I started back in 07.
GameSack You look more buff than usual. You must be working out or something.
GameSack TheWillofDC hey you went a little far with the air kiss thing i mean hey i like a good ass fuck as much as the next guy but hey im on youtube being a fagg
GameSack alright guys, i just want anyone that has anything to say to comment back to me... If youre a Shaytards fan, what do YOU think it is about the vlogsaudience that is causing them to lose subscribers??
GameSack TheWillofDC i love you (: you keep me in the winners and losers. btw wheres nigahiga, and phillipdefranco D
GameSack The Shaytards are not as entertaining as they once were. At one point I checked the Shaytards page waiting for a vlog to come out and now Im still subscribed but havent watched a vlog in months. For me NerdzRL is my favorite daily vlogger ever.
TopGear Mil gracias es lo mejor
TopGear I didnt even know the word slope had other meanings until all this palaver, but having heard that I now find this segment hilarious.
TopGear I think they talk about the bridge
TopGear He definitely meant it. Hes the sort of piece of shit who takes pride in offending people. He says theres a slope ON it not theres a slope TO it so its obvious hes trying to be clever with his subtle racist joke. Its not natural otherwise for him to say on in this sentence. Hes not stupid and is generally quite eloquent. He definitely meant it. I think the lawsuit is a bit ridiculous but I do think Clarkson should be sacked by the BBC.
TopGear Lexus LFA is no more better than 2014 Nissan GTR or AMS
TopGear thats their Cb handle
TopGear Why do all your videos have the bottom cropped off and all stretched and distorted. Not watchable. Super low definition. May as well not even upload them.
TopGear i dont care how bad the quality is. free episodes!
TopGear Adam used a different chrysler for the river cross!! CHEATER!!!!!!
TopGear LOL dat yellow tractor
TopGear the mustang 2 is no longer the worst...Introducing the new Toyota Yaris!
TopGear Yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

TopGear The crews using jeeps and ford trucks for the land clips, helicopters and those flying droid things in the air
TopGear I want to sleep in that little house
TopGear I would clearly get the subaru
TopGear Please upload more top gear videos they are awesome
TopGear top gear uk rocks and this isnt bad but no comparisn against the original uk version
TopGear European Supercars are better than American Supercars like from Europe You can have a Ferrari, Aston Martin, Lamborghini, Porsche and Mclaren
TopGear I thought alot of car guys have heard of Morgan...
TopGear I would so love to do a tuff truck challenge with these guys
TopGear I am reading yours tweets guys and just laughing myself :D Does even Richard know this?
TopGear Vertical video? Really?
TopGear andasyoucouldhaveimaginedivedonethisproperlythis could be a nice hashtag..
TopGear its got nothing to do with how obsolete tv stations are becoming. The problem is that certain TV shows in certain countries are not paying enough money to get the shows on air. Peer to peer acts as an avenue to advertise the show people that do not have a huge budget normally use peer to peer to advertise their products, and it is proven that they still make a lot of money using peer to peer as an advertising tool. Making back money with DVDs etc etc. Game of Thrones is one of the most pirated TV shows ever but they still make over double the amount of money that they put in the show
TopGear big thanks for posting it 3 and bless you for subtitles!
TopGear Who ever has subscribed to my channel i would like to say thank you
TopGear Surprised to see the V8 pass the GT3 on the straight, or am I missing something?
TopGear The rope by which the table cloth was tied and attached to the car should be below the height of the table whereas here its not...
ZONEofTECH Sorry for the delay guys!Editing this took me more than I expected. Topped in at 48h (my personal record).Just to give you an idea on why it took me so long: spent 3h picking the right background songs for the video and edited every single image that I used, in photoshop. Took me ages to find the imagesvideo I was looking for.At least, after 48h of work I am 100 satisfied of the outcome.Hope you are as well :)DanielZONEofTECH
ZONEofTECH flexible glass?bullshit that cant be real.
ZONEofTECH Yes make that video please, I need to know the differences
ZONEofTECH Speak italian...PLEASE
ZONEofTECH You look like Andrew garfield
ZONEofTECH Will iPhones and iPads be getting iOS8
ZONEofTECH U KNOW JUST BECUZ U PUT AN I IN FRONT OF EVERYTHING DOES NOT MAKE IT APPLES IDEA THEIVES
ZONEofTECH Will the glass make it more expensive?
ZONEofTECH I will buy it if, it can make phone calls!
ZONEofTECH I actually like the one better than two because it is more practical, but two is still amazing
ZONEofTECH I think I like 5 best lol
ZONEofTECH Number 2 is the best but i like number 5 aesthetically
ZONEofTECH Number 5 and 2 are sick
ZONEofTECH wow, where can i get a hold of Farahi to come do rendering for my co.? )
ZONEofTECH HAHAHAHAHAHA South Africa in the World Cup Final! XD
ZONEofTECH 5 is absolutely ridiculous lol
ZONEofTECH definitely 3. or maybe 5

ZONEofTECH Its FINALLY HERE!iWatch  Final Leaks  RumorsNEW Apple iWatch  FINAL Leaks  RumorsIf you enjoyed my iPhone 6  Final Leaks  Rumors video, this one is even better :)Enjoy!DanielZONEofTECH
ZONEofTECH are you the amazing spiderman???
ZONEofTECH What is Apple trying to do make a phone into paper?
ZONEofTECH Im wait for the Iphone10! Lol
ZONEofTECH U look like they guy from amazing spiderman )
ZONEofTECH You look like spider man
ZONEofTECH Take the iPhone 6 we have a real time communication to the phone based on official AI you automatically change into full voice mode when you move above 20 miles an hour and I dont think theyre going to make any bigger day have a lot of parts from the iPhone 5c so we will see colors
ZONEofTECH Good thing I got no contract on my galaxy s5 to switch on this baby if its any good when it releases
ZONEofTECH Looks nice... not THAT MUCH of a difference, but then again Im still using the GS3 cause I didnt see much of an incentive to get the 4... maybe Ill get the GS5 or the Note 3 (If only theyd come out with a GS with a built in Spen).I really dont get the complaints about the plastic backs.... 1st: If you DONT put your smartphone in a case, youre a flippin idiot, so what does it matter what the back looks like 2nd: THANK GOD I can remove the back case to change out batteries AND additional SD cards... again, you have to be an idiot to buy a phone that is sealed with no way of expanding memory or easily putting in a fresh or new battery and 3rd: WHY would any intelligent and practical person PREFER to have the extra weight of a metal brick in their pocket (what, that huge new phone isnt heavy enough for you?) and WHY would any intelligent and practical person want a phone surrounded by glass all around (that new expensive gadget isnt delicate enough for you?) and 4th: why would any practical person prefer a more expensive phone just because its wrapped in stainless steel or aluminum when it will just be covered up in a PLASTIC protective case anyway... DUH. It just comes down to shallow vanity... and besides, you look like idiots covering up your TOO delicate, TOO heavy, and TOO expensive fruits with those GIANT Otter case within a case within a case within a case.... I LOVE my GS3... and although the GS5 isnt an earth shattering new model, all I truly look for is: ram, memory, battery sizelife WITH easy access, and SD card capable... and Samsung has delivered in ALL the truly important areas, with the added beauty of their HD screen and camera.My ONLY regret is that its a Googleandroid phone... I used to love Google, but I have grown to HATE Google in the past couple of years, with that hate growing more and more every passing day. With as much as I love Samsung GalaxiesNotes... I have to confess that my disdain of Google is pushing me towards an iPhone or Windows phone in my future. Google seems to have gone off the deep end and seems to THINK that we LIKE being dragged with them eventhough were kicking and screaming the whole time... they have gone blind, deaf, and dumb to us regular users... they have shown they simply dont care about us anymore... they are no longer our heros... they have become our oppressive captors instead... am I the only one who remembers that same tyranny from Microsoft in the Nineties???Google SERIOUSLY needs to get back to their roots and remind themselves of what made them so different and so beloved in the first place.
ZONEofTECH This is major disappointment after a great phone like S4, what were they thinking with the band aid design?
ZONEofTECH i mean a vid of how it is more for sure it is going to be
ZONEofTECH i have iphone 4 ios 5.1.1 and i update my iphone to ios 7.0.6 from iphone setting and now i have apple logo on and off, can u fix it
ZONEofTECH Can u help me root my s4 19505 qualcomm updated to 4.3 thanks
ZONEofTECH Great video again Dan. So detailed and yet such fun to watch....as i said before in my tweet, really appreciate your editing skills my friend. Keep em coming.As for the S5, waiting for it and planning to buy as well. Hope it pleases all of us. P.S. Loved the blooper....ally :D....double thumbs up just for that only )
ZONEofTECH apple is going to have a 5.5 inch screen for the iphone 6 ,but thats when the note 4 comes in with way better features than iphone 6 and s 5 .the note 4 will have 5.9 inch screen
ZONEofTECH they are not announcing a tab 4
ZONEofTECH You look like Andrew garfeild
ZONEofTECH good ,My online shops have ,
ZONEofTECH You look so much like Andrew
ZONEofTECH My mom still uses her NOKIA 6110, what is the big deal about all these IPHONE and Samsung?? as long as you can send messages, make calls and received calls all are fine, nokia old phone and my old trusty motorola which are key pads phone are good and made for people who are honest folks, you can text while having a dump, while eating, while driving, while talking to someone with your fingers instinctively knowing where to press, while masturbating, HELL I can even stroke my girlfriends twat and suck on her breasts and ass, having sex while looking and texting on my trusty motorola phone..what is the big deal about all these Iphone and Galaxy??? it is expensive, goes out fashion in a flash, this is just a way for these people to cheat our hard earned money for things we do not really need...if you want to check out the internet and work on your computers just stick to your PC or laptop...bunch of nonsense, this is the classic story as depicted in the Stephen Kings horror novel Needful Things you people are sad people, havent got a life??? just waiting for the latest phones from these big companies cheating on peoples money...GET A LIFE YOU SAD MISERABLE PEOPLE, there are better things to do than to comment of what is and when is the next phone coming!!!!
ZONEofTECH your audio is weird sounds muffled
ZONEofTECH So to summarize Apple copied all the Android Manufacturers with the bigger screen?
ZONEofTECH Good review however somewhat not true. Apple did decide to change the iconic home button. The 5s doesnt have the square due to impairing the fingerprint reader. Other than that great video man! Love your stuff
ZONEofTECH Apple iPhone 6, tiny bit bigger...... Nothing else Hope you douchebags enjoy last century technology! Getting fucked by Apple over charging and rated piece of shite! And of course Apple will be changing the: chargers, headphones and accessories. Hope you lot have fun being fucked over!
ZONEofTECH Santa brought me nothing for Christmas
ZONEofTECH I got pencils, a watch, a gift card to Khols, a spherical rubics cube, and CANDY!!!

ZONEofTECH What the point to buy macpro and install windows on it ?
ZONEofTECH A question, when you connect you laptop by hdmi. Does still have the same performance?
ZONEofTECH Not on my version. Thats because I got mine from a pirate ship ifyouknowwhatImean :))
ZONEofTECH Are you going to upload video about Call of Duty Ghosts Retina MacBook Pro (Late 13) performance:  ? :D
ZONEofTECH u use parallel desktop?
ZONEofTECH Not trying to bash, I have a Macbook Pro 13 2012 myself, but this is pretty sad. This is barely better than a PS4 or Xbone, and costs 4X or more.
ZONEofTECH Nice video. Nitpick: Windows does support High DPI since the XP days, so way before OSX. Their approach doesnt work as good in practice as the Approach taken by Apple, but it works reasonably well.
ZONEofTECH NEW VIDEO!Crysis 3 on the NEW Retina MacBook Pro!
ZONEofTECH we love Romenia kiss from Serbia
ZONEofTECH Im on a PC at the moment, but Im thinking of buying this retina macbook.Intel Core i7 4880k 3,7ghz Ive bridge ECorsair 32gb quad channelGeforce GTX 660Samsung 512gb ssd22 TB WD Black 7200rpm
ZONEofTECH hey  can you do a comparison between the early 2013 15 2.8Ghz i7 16gb  768 ssd retina VS a late 2013 haswell 2.6Ghz i7 16gb  1TB pci flash retina???????????????????????????????????
ZONEofTECH NEW video!iPhone 5S vs iPhone 5C!FIGHT!
ZONEofTECH Awesome, great video buddy!
ZONEofTECH Great video! Im a photographer and I was wondering which one is right for me. I mostly use Lightroom and will be storing all my photos on an external Hd. I will be working with large files between 4050 MB. Which MBP do you suggest?
ZONEofTECH Never thought Id see Cesc Fabregas reviewing a MacBook Pro
ZONEofTECH Great video! Looking forward to your full review and gaming benchmarks :)
ZONEofTECH Such an expensive computer and yet my MacBook Pro 13 is better. (Not screen wise)

ZONEofTECH New video is here!iPhone 5S vs Samsung Galaxy S4!FIGHT!
ZONEofTECH Why you have black hands?
ZONEofTECH i would say that the gold version would be cool if they had it in black and gold or space grey and gold in stead of white and gold! Go Space Grey! :)
ZONEofTECH Guys come to my channel! we have lots of unboxings. we are small now but we will become big! thanks (some unnboxings: 5s, 27 imac, nikon) we regularly update content please check us out. we also do all sorts of videos :)
ZONEofTECH yes...... i am having an iPhone 5 black(slate) since dec 2012......... and till the date my phone doesnt have a single scuff at all....... its still looks the same when i bought it......
ZONEofTECH You look like Andrew Garfield
ZONEofTECH Is it weird that he looks like drake from drake and josh
ZONEofTECH For some reason the phone looks used.
ZONEofTECH Japanese is after French at the start screen.
ZONEofTECH Are you willing to give away that iphone 5S cause I really need a phone.
ZONEofTECH Whoops! My bad! Thanks for noticing.
ZONEofTECH Samsung phones  plastic shits
ZONEofTECH Why do we buy a colored phone to put it inside of an ugly case? I mean I have a case but it matches my colored phone. Just keep your damn phone protected.
ZONEofTECH Xbox 360 :) Keep up the awesome videos I really like that your channel has grown because you put so much effort into giving us quality content.
ZONEofTECH Did everything :) I think that this giveaway is amazing!! Would love to get gta in pc and the iphone 5c would just be wow! Good Luck everyone! :)
ZONEofTECH xbox 360 would be da bomb! :)
ZONEofTECH Xbox I dont have face twitt or google
ZONEofTECH The real winner is the galaxy S4. Im not joking, I see in slow motion.
ZONEofTECH I have s3 (alittle modified build root deodexed etc) it starts up way faster than this 2. cant imagine how fast s4 can be with some modifications
ZONEofTECH Honestly get the 4S.. Its a far more premium device..glass, vs plastic..and steel antenna bands.. It was once flagship..and 5c just a cheap plastic phone..Get the 5s if you can..always get the flagship phone
ZONEofTECH Well no wonder the 5c is better it is an iphone 5 in a plastic shell
ZONEofTECH And also I dont like the fact that the 5C is plastic .
ZONEofTECH This video doesnt make any sense we all know the 5c is faster since it has the A6 Chip and the iPhone 4s has the A5 Chip
ZONEofTECH Lol!! Screw you!!! The poly carbonate dint help the iphone 5c!!! Its too damn flashy and looks a bit funny!! Coming to technical views 4s is much better than 5c!! Pretty boy grow up!!! 4s is a Steve Jobs revolutionary product!! :) 4s is still a good phone than 5c :)
ZONEofTECH your own 4s has problem!!its to slow!!!in all!!itsnt true!!only the first 3..is better!!butmy old nokia has boot time 10 sec!!!its better from ALL??4 5 6 7 my 4s is exactly the same EXACTLY THE SAME with 5c
ZONEofTECH I love my iPhone 5c its the best, FYI the iPhone 4S brakes more easily since its all glass and the 5c is plastic so its a little bit more durable.
ZONEofTECH Um excuse the iphone5c red is pink did you notice that
ZONEofTECH Coldplay in the background.
ZONEofTECH I would love the IPhone 5c
ZONEofTECH If anyones interested, heres an iPhone 5C unboxing I did with one of my music tracks called Sun Beam http:youtu.beuz7uDCyrGD8
ZONEofTECH 5C is the worst Iphone model yet. Do not buy it. You are wasting a upgrade.
ZONEofTECH I loved the green one!
ZONEofTECH Did it come with a sim card
ZONEofTECH i want one bc my mom wont get me one
ZONEofTECH i dont care what colour it is as long as its an iphone...but white would great.....post it to Malaysia plss..... :)

Now I could have this over his head and seeing is how its a third party (named ZoneofTech, Im sure itll be a slap in the face. lol) One thing I will give him is his phone is faster than my 4 (old phone), but I mean....my 4 is WAYYY older.

ZONEofTECH You didnt pay attention to my video. After youve installed BETA 2 you just go to Software update and BETA 3 will install automatically. You only need to install BETA 1 manually, the rest of them install automatically from within iOS 7.

ZONEofTECH Or you can just turn off your iPhone  then plug it in into iTunes but as soon as the Apple logo comes on hold the home button. Phone will go into recovery mode  iTunes will ask for a restore
ZONEofTECH This is the only method that I tried that actually worked! thank you so much! 1 subscriber
ZONEofTECH Maybe you should try installing it again because you might have downloaded the mac version.
ZONEofTECH recboot for x64 systems does exist?
ZONEofTECH Why isnt my iTunes picking the Recboot up?
ZONEofTECH does this work on Windows
ZONEofTECH press home button and button for turn device ONOFF...hold that two buttons together till you dont see an apple logo on the screen
ZONEofTECH Youre the fucking best!!!!!!!! Youre so amazing thank you so much!!!!!
ZONEofTECH It does not work at all
ZONEofTECH I am already running ios 6.1.4 do I have to restore anyways to the one from the website?
ZONEofTECH HOw long does it take to finally update? Just wondering?
ZONEofTECH firstly i need to update beta 1 and next beat 2... are can i directly in to beta 2
ZONEofTECH or you can simply download the iOS 7 beta 3 from .kappleos7.om I tried it and worked out of the box. Download was simple and secure. Many people have already got it , you can too :) Cheers !

ZONEofTECH Why dont you get it in the UK...
ZONEofTECH I like the update. But I hate the music app. My family uses 1 iCloud account so there music goes to my phone and my music goes to there phone.the only bad thing about it. They need to make it where we can delete music from your phone.
ZONEofTECH didnt have in denmark :(
ZONEofTECH how do u delete the music though kuz it still appear kuz of ma icloud bu I dnt want em no more
ZONEofTECH Free...with Ads Crowd claps
ZONEofTECH So not a hands on demo, twat
ZONEofTECH hands on not a hands on
ZONEofTECH !!      !!  :http:www.apple.commacpro
ZONEofTECH wtf this was not a review
ZONEofTECH Apple love to pretend there making ground breaking tech when i could have done this on my phone back in 2001 (infrared sharing). Besides sending photos over wattsapp would be just as easy as this.
ZONEofTECH Its like android creates the function and later on apple creates the explained one.
ZONEofTECH apple dissing samsung :p
ZONEofTECH So, basically it behaves like Nintendos StreetPass, but its manual and not automatic?
ZONEofTECH Well, Android Beam and S Beam need Bluetooth and Wifi (respectively) to work, i.e. to transfer files. The NFC only pairs two devices. AirDrop is useful between computers that you cant bump into each other. It is pretty much like sending files between devices with Bluetooth, but with WiFi. Id have liked to see AirDrop on iOS activated by NFC (at least as an option alongside the current method).
ZONEofTECH Just got a message beta2 has been released
ZONEofTECH How more longer we much to wait for ios7 for ipad mini
ZONEofTECH I like the new design for the lock and home screen and I dont use safari so
ZONEofTECH for retards that like to spend too much money. iSheeep. It looks like it doesnt have anything close to the features Jelly Bean and BB OS10.1 has and by the time its released there will be Key Lime and 10.3 in beta (which 10.2 will have everything jelly bean has at its current state on the S4 like the eye reading n stuff)
ZONEofTECH I hope this voice will be used in Voiceover on Mac and IOS.
ZONEofTECH Does the new ios7 come with new sounds for texts and ringtones?
ZONEofTECH I dont have siri on my iphone 4 ios 7 what should I do plz help!
ZONEofTECH its realised on iphone 4. yes. also samsung are just cheap plastic copy cats
ZONEofTECH I bought that ipod for xmas and not long after I found out it doesnt have a back camera now im really upset :(
ZONEofTECH Can we change the black screen in to a white screen
ZONEofTECH why does every retard care about the 16gig ipod touch 5 without a camera
ZONEofTECH Can I Have The 32Gb I Bought 16gb its so crappy plz give it
ZONEofTECH Im sorry, I dont know what the play button does. Does it takes you to options or the forums? Can someone tell me? lol...
ZONEofTECH Here you can get real free Riot RP Points:Visit:.RiotCodesGenerator.om.online points generator, no money  I hope this helps!!!
ZONEofTECH Add me plz name is. ( xxwildstarxx)
ZONEofTECH I cant close the program or turn off the computer then because the next time i want to play it i have to redownload it
ZONEofTECH 6th :) and yes I do plan on getting this when it comes out. It seems very worth it
ZONEofTECH Will the 360 pads work on xbox one  do they conect the same ?
ZONEofTECH why tf would they put it like that the batter back is ugly
ZONEofTECH I wanted to know what the two buttons do in the middle? I think its menu and switch screen to full size and back again but wanted to know for sure.
ZONEofTECH Is the iTouch giveaway true? Please reply.
ZONEofTECH Your mothers a gunther fuck ya lyfe
ZONEofTECH 8 core vs 4 core doesnt have anything to do with trust and reliability. i52500k is the number one recommended processor for gaming. Not to mention you will never need 8 cores for gaming. Using the argument you wont use 8gb of ram then saying Ill take my 8 core processor is idiotic. On top of that, if you own no consoles you have absolutely no room to debate on them. I have owned most consoles at one point or another, including all the modern ones and custom PCs. I can use experience.
ZONEofTECH You are a honest man :) i doubted you and am sorry for that
ZONEofTECH Number 5. Good functions to same design. Number 1 seemed to be imitated from Windows. Apple doesnt need that
ZONEofTECH number 5 hasnt got any sort of design change apart from the additions like the widgets which Apple arent going to do, they have stated they are going to make it more glance able but not with widgets. 4 and 3 are so different users wont know how to operate which apple have already talk about and said that hey wont change the way the phone works to much. 2 concept much be a possibility but with a design model design. number 1 is probably most accurate.
ZONEofTECH some of these concept artists need to get jobs at apple i would love if apple made ios 7 like this
ZONEofTECH And I love the flat display I cant wait till it comes out!!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH 00:43 yes we do go to the apple website
ZONEofTECH Yes, thats right. Why are you asking this :)) this you steal an iPhone recently :)?
ZONEofTECH 1 was gorgeous. very elegant appearing. 5 had a real MS Metro look to it...didnt care for that at all!
ZONEofTECH Pc gaming for the win
ZONEofTECH wont pay a dollar for any apple product, wont even take their piece of shit product for free
ZONEofTECH AND IN MY DAM COUNTRY IT IS GONNA BE 160 DAM BUCKS
ZONEofTECH if the iphone c (cheap) is gonna be 300 dollars that doesnt make sense because at verizon the iphone 5 is 199 for 26 gbs
ZONEofTECH Its going to be cheap so it will be rubbish quality. I say they dont
ZONEofTECH iPhone 5 already has Siri
ZONEofTECH 8s its a super awsome phone if got one, yellow and grey
ZONEofTECH this is fake as shit, i have adblock so you didnt even get your 114 of a penny for my view
ZONEofTECH Samsung making more annoying phone these days.. S4 just okay than this weird phone.. Mega for what??
ZONEofTECH This was a comparisson.
ZONEofTECH iPhone games are better optimized? Dude wtf that is not fault of samsung . its so interesting how many idiots are on net
ZONEofTECH finally someone who made it perfect!! I know now what is my choise!
ZONEofTECH Iphone 4s WINS!! Lol!! ..
ZONEofTECH I got the s3 mini and i love it
ZONEofTECH Good that I was going to get s3 mini anyway
ZONEofTECH Brilliant ! Super ! You is the BEST!!!
ZONEofTECH FIRST. S3 mini has Super amoled screen vs FTF on iphone and also S3 mini wins at gaming beous of bettee specs
ZONEofTECH Working on it. Part 6, Part 8 and the main video should be up my midnight. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH In the unboxing and review of the Samsung Galaxy S 3 Mini you said that it had a noise canceling mic next to the micro usb port?
ZONEofTECH The iphone is sort of better but in my country the iphone is about 800 and the s3 mini is 300 and the s3 mini is a good price
ZONEofTECH who puts an ad in the middle of the vid
ZONEofTECH I want to get samsung galaxy s4. I currently have a very bad 30 phone :(
ZONEofTECH You cannot change the graphics settings in Temple Run not Real Racing 3. Both phones run the games at their highest possible settings.
ZONEofTECH well lazydougie28 ur right but also remember the more megapixel the camera have the sharper the better the camera will be
ZONEofTECH its not about the megapixel of the camera but the lens they use in camera. s3 mini is better.
ZONEofTECH The iphone 4s doesnt have macro mode.
ZONEofTECH you love the 4s admit it
ZONEofTECH Thank you WazzUppProductions :) WAZZZUUUPPPPPP!!!
ZONEofTECH i got s3 mini for my mom she loves it
ZONEofTECH Inyoure..? I think its pronounced inear )
ZONEofTECH i will buy this soon what color should i choose black or white?
ZONEofTECH do you really think we care about whats on the outside of the box
ZONEofTECH Sweet thing!!! ) If youre from UK get the GALAXY mini from Amazon  amzn.to16TPlHh
ZONEofTECH I dont understand why others are always saying samsung s4 is laggy but still watching s4 reviews in YouTube. .haha..
ZONEofTECH People complaining about 8 cores is effing retarded. Samsung DID NOT put 8 cores to make the phone more powerful. No. They did it so that they can deliver decent power, and the same time, deliver much better battery efficiency. That is the whole idea behind 8 cores. BETTER BATTERY LIFE. get some effing education GEEZ Also people who complains about the size are retarded since s4 is smaller than s3 in every aspect(except for the screen size)
ZONEofTECH thanx so much, its really helpfull
ZONEofTECH Megabajts ? megabytes I think...
ZONEofTECH 1000 likes from me and who are those people that disliked??
ZONEofTECH i was waiting for iphone 5s but fuck it this one is 3times better then iphone. allways on top. i love u samsung.
ZONEofTECH i was waiting for iphone 5s but fuck it this one is 3times better then iphone. allways on top. i love u samsung.
ZONEofTECH I changed from iPhone My only negative is that instructions for the bazillion features are not easily had. On the other hand bye bye iphone got the Samsung tablet and s4 WONDERFUL
ZONEofTECH Let us see the original first then give you the suggestion.... However the AppleApple only, after S4 release will tell you the truth..
ZONEofTECH your a pretty android fanboy arent you. You scream that on all the android videos almost ..
ZONEofTECH I found a winner!!! :)
ZONEofTECH Youre right not INHAND review, but THE PHONE (Galaxy S4) is AWESOME... forget AWESOME,,, Smart Scroll is AWESOME,.... we will have to invent new Adjectives to describe Galaxy S4... how about its GALAXOME...
ZONEofTECH apple sold their soul to samsung in a sale
ZONEofTECH Do u sell it i I have samsung s3 and i do not know how to donwold music
ZONEofTECH if u bye the iphone5s u bye the same thing u bought a year ago
ZONEofTECH I still have the S2 and I have compared it to Ip5 and I know my S2 is better. What is Apple going to do to compete with S4... I dont know... Apple Lost the Hardware War, now Samsung is beating them in software... I only wish BLACKBERRY users would give Galaxy a try... any Galaxy... even the S2... which I now have... P.S. I was a Blackberry user from NEXTEL days... Blackberry was a Great phone... But you have NO ideal what you are missing with ANDROID. Same Goes for PALM dieHards.
ZONEofTECH anybody who owns an iPhone. now should be ashamed and embarrassed in themselves.
ZONEofTECH you should be ashamed for saying iphone V is the best fucking fail of a phone.
ZONEofTECH All those popups are annoying.
ZONEofTECH yer 3rd commet. i cant wait untill it comes out thumbs up if u like the samsunggalaxy 4 comes out :)
ZONEofTECH wow pretty impresive almost looks as good as need for speed most wanted on ps vita

ZONEofTECH Dude, stop trying to profit from misguided people. THE iWATCH ISNT REAL (YET). I would be more forgiving if you SAID it was fake and a concept. angryface
ZONEofTECH I think it will be square and super thin curved a bit waterproof the arm band will be hi gloss have a cam for facetime

ZONEofTECH Windows, Mac OS 10.8, Linux, Android, and IOS
ZONEofTECH Fuxk i just bought mountain lion just cuz i wanted to get the lastest
ZONEofTECH mac osx 10.8.3, and Ill be one of the first to get 10.9, I bought Mountain Lion the day it came out, right after watching the keynote... I used to have windows, but once I got a Mac, I cound never go without one. I do have parallels desktop, but I always prefer to just use the Mac OS.
ZONEofTECH Why did they screw up the controller
ZONEofTECH No, I hate call of duty I think its the most hideous creation of the modern world. I like games that push hardware to the limits.
ZONEofTECH I just jumped on the Best Buy website and found a Quad Core PC with 8gb of Ram (Upgradeable to 32gb) Windows 8, and a 1TB hdd with a 2.6Ghz processor for exactly 429 ! Sounds like the PC is the better deal. And last time I checked, there is no console to date that can match these specs. Heck, the Xbox 720 wont even be able to match them either! By the way, 240 sure can buy several PC games, Dozens upon dozens, just go check out Steam!!!!!
ZONEofTECH are you stupid the new xbox is not named yet and the controler is not like that
ZONEofTECH are you stupid the new xbox is not named yet and the controler is not like that
ZONEofTECH That is a great misunderstanding from a lot of people! But the fact is that you dont need a lot of money to buy a good PC that can run the latest games. With only 500, you can buy a PC that can run all of the latest games that have been coming out on consoles. When you compare that price to the 350 that you have to spend on a console, Id say the PC would be the best choice, considering that you can also use any type of screen and adapt a controller to it as well!
ZONEofTECH Why does quadcore suck? its still better than dual core Radeon? no one knows that. The only thing thats for sure is the video memory, which is 2 GB. And yes, the reuse of games sucks :( I forgot to mention that in the video but both PS4 and the new Xbox will prevent you from reusingrenting a game.
ZONEofTECH Will the game graphics be better than the xbox360 please
ZONEofTECH Niklasfrilander But you have to ask what sort of service ps3 delivered? How many time has sonys network gone down, there security got hacked and lost loads of peoples details which sony shouldnt of been holding in the 1st place. The network was very slow and laggy, plus you really shouldnt do gaming with wireless its bad on pings plus do you really want Cancer? Wireless is worster than a mobile phone...
ZONEofTECH Is this really working or youre just trolling everybody? lawl
ZONEofTECH to everyone wondering if still works! IT HAS BEEN PATCHED THEREFORE IT DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE! IVE TRIED EVERYTHING OVER 20 TIMES
ZONEofTECH is it still working? zonetech?
ZONEofTECH Problem is that they didi it xP
ZONEofTECH A mi me funciono...!!!!
ZONEofTECH It works!!!!! Thx man a lot!!
ZONEofTECH It does work on HoTS. Ok :) The requests for that video have been INSANE :D Tomorrow (4th of July 2013!) The independence day will bring some independence to Heart of the Swarm as well (if you know what I mean)
ZONEofTECH im confused : when at 1:49 when u said select ipsw i didnt download it so it didnt work. HELP ME?
ZONEofTECH Yup, I live in manchester :)
ZONEofTECH Watching this on my ipad mini
ZONEofTECH Guys, please LIKE and SHARE this videos so more people can see it. Thank you :D
ZONEofTECH you should return it, you still got time
ZONEofTECH 1) Optical drive is obsolete, nobody uses it anymore. (I havent used one for over a year) 2) It DOES have a Mini Display Port BUT no computer can input video, just output. So the only way to play xboxps3 is to connect them to your TVmonitor
ZONEofTECH How do you delete a task?
ZONEofTECH No, but Siri works exactly the same on both the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 4S. No differences at all.
ZONEofTECH Now I get it! thanks! :D
ZONEofTECH you say this works on windows? how do I configure windows for this? thanx

ZONEofTECH hey nice video.. may i know if the ipod touch 5 has been released in stores?
ZONEofTECH ME TOO I CANT WAIT!!! im getting either white or blue, cant figure out which one
ZONEofTECH Most likely getting it Wednesday :)
ZONEofTECH It is official apple will release and iPod touch 5g in October along with the iPad mini
ZONEofTECH What is that thing on the back, in the upper right corner ??? Cant wait !!!
ZONEofTECH if youre talking about the camera flash, it does..it has an LED flash, but if youre talking about the flash plugin for browsers then No, no apple products have flash support.
ZONEofTECH No dumb ass gamerx it will last for 40 hours if u listen to music bitch
ZONEofTECH i still love my5 gen ipod nano .
ZONEofTECH It really is a video. Kenburns effect for the pictures with the trailer turns it into an EPIC blockbuster movie.
ZONEofTECH shut the fuck up asshole apple copied nobody
ZONEofTECH Nope, before the iPhone 99 of the phones werent tochscreens, the only famous touch screen phone before the iPhone was the LG Prada, which DIDNT have a green phone icon. Anyway, they even positioned the phone icon INSIDE the green app, the same way they did on the iPhone. At least they couldve changed it somehow. 2nd. The iPhone design dates from 2004, while the iPhone 4 design dates from 2008, so back in 2007 they didnt have the iPhone 4 design.
ZONEofTECH Look at the pictures of Samsung products after the iPhone was announced and after then come back with a good argument
ZONEofTECH this phone is so shit
ZONEofTECH nice phone very very nice
ZONEofTECH Its 18....I even posted a link in the description...
ZONEofTECH how many dollars you pay
ZONEofTECH Which Ios Version is the newest for the iPhone 3GS?

ZONEofTECH Cool does it have voice over?
ZONEofTECH How do you like your ipad? My parents do not want me to download itunes because it can cause viruses, but is it necessary to have it if you have icloud?
ZONEofTECH I think it is not a fair vs, as there are better HDD with 7200. I suggest a SSD with Black WD at 7200rpm.
ZONEofTECH great indepth video!! thank you...im buying the SSD!
ZONEofTECH no one was talking to you bitch
ZONEofTECH Grape is slang for gang rape. Please dont post any videos :P
ZONEofTECH Well, Internet Recovery ONLY reinstalls your OS (LionMountain Lion) and only works on 2011 or newer MBPs. After you got your OS onto your new SSD, you have to restore your data from a Time Machine Backup.
ZONEofTECH Nah, I just think that everything they manage to pull off in terms of their bullshit hardashell to customise and maintain is nuts, and the prices they change is beyond belief.
ZONEofTECH There is a way to edit the image so it will fit on a standard DVD, but I cant remember how. :(
ZONEofTECH haha stick in there thats what she said
ZONEofTECH Thx :D be sure to SUBSCRIBE to my channel if you enjoyed my content Cheers :D !
ZONEofTECH SOLVED: It seems that one of my RAM is loose. Thats what the 3 beeps meant.

ZONEofTECH Sory dude you got ripped of i got a cooling pad for 5 that can reach speeds up to 2800 rpm
TopGear New connected car standards put Europe into top gearImagine that you are driving along, and a message is projected on your windscreen, warning you of an accident that has just happened around the next corner. This could soon be a reality thanks to new European standards. Connected cars, able to communicate with each other and with road infrastructures, are expected to appear on European roads in 2015.Two European standards organisations, ETSI and CEN, confirmed today that the basic set of standards requested by the European Commission to make connected cars a reality has been fully completed. The norms which they have adopted ensure that vehicles made by different manufacturers can communicate with each other.The EU invested more than 180 million in research projects on cooperative transport systems, whose results helped develop the standards. This will put the European car industry, which provides 13 million jobs, out in front in the race to develop the next generation of cars.http:europa.eurapidpressreleaseIP14141en.pdf

screenjunkies Do one for Forrest Gump
screenjunkies say: Put a donk on it.

screenjunkies fua, I would very much like to be a part of you
screenjunkies holy shit! flula is fucking famous!
screenjunkies Phr33Pur3 neither do I, but hipsters used to be a smaller part of trendsetters, allways stating that they started wearing this and listening to that BEFORE it was popular. remember? hipsters used to not go with social trends, at least thats what they thought.
screenjunkies Flula, you make me so happy.
screenjunkies You met Ed Helms. I envy you forever.
screenjunkies Usually when the interviewer tries to get more attention than the stars, they fail and its really painful to watch. This time it was glorious.
screenjunkies Where do I get the Tshirt with the laser beam eye cat? Can I get the Amazing Flula to sign it?
retrogametech Nice book, I might pick one up.

screenjunkies Watha you are a stupid
screenjunkies He is no pixel Dan. Too bad. It would make him more lickable.
screenjunkies Im just roasting my friend. Its his 30th birthday. Most of these clips are from 3 or 4 years ago. :) Hes actually a great guy and really close friend. He has close to 100,000 subscribers so people love his videos!
screenjunkies where is the guy from Honest Trailers , THE ONE WITH SUPER COOL VOICE :o
screenjunkies 0:32 Nick Mundy meets THE ROCK
screenjunkies 0:38 Just like that my attention span is gone
screenjunkies Every time I decide to watch the Screen Junkies show, I end up regretting it. Ive said it before and Ill say it again: Hal Rudnick sucks.
screenjunkies YES cinema sins, HISHE, and screen junkies my dream has come true
screenjunkies Ey, next anniversary, can it be hosted by me and mr.peabody and Sherman pleaseMy birthday is in September 20!
screenjunkies You, CinemaSins and HISHE should really make a channel or a parody together :)
screenjunkies Nostalgia Critic is without a doubt the best thing in this video :P
screenjunkies cabea decepada na tartaruga explosiva foi foda! kkkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies O que fazer sem Breaking Bad?
screenjunkies Cadela  o caralho, vadia.
screenjunkies Caralho, no paro de procurar coisas sobre breaking bad... algum ja traduziu os minisodes?
screenjunkies O avatar que era avatar no pode ser chamado de avatar, j o avatar que no era avatar, acabou ficando com o nome de avatar :D
screenjunkies AFTER EARTH  TO RUIM ASSIM PRA COMPARAR COM ESSA PORCARIA AI???
screenjunkies e... quem quer ser um milionrio?!
screenjunkies inhale cringe exhale loudly
screenjunkies 2:41VINCE: oh god whats fucking next
screenjunkies The Jennifer Aniston part.
screenjunkies While The Last Airbender is abhorrently bad, After Earth is much worse.
screenjunkies Lolol i saw that after school special in health
screenjunkies Is vince vaughns character going to be found in the the new jurassic park movie that is coming out?
screenjunkies i think you pissed him off when he was like guess who fell down right before the finish line and you like lance Armstrong and he was all like no no.... peter bilingsle
screenjunkies happy birthday shoesy!
screenjunkies We all know Nick Mundys answer.
screenjunkies Choosing between vin diesel and the rock is like choosing between a broken arm and a broken leg.... i would choose the rock because vins a broken leg and i hate crutches
screenjunkies If I wanted to street race this scion what would I wanna do to it? Trade it in for something else.
screenjunkies I always thought it was pancakes.
screenjunkies If youre still trying to decide whos better between Vin Diesel or The Rock you should ask them both to beat you to a pulp and see who was better at it. Better yet, have someone record it and upload it and well let you know in the comments.
screenjunkies Vin Diesel, hands down. Water has the power to wear down and destroy The Rock, whereas Vin, with a lower specific gravity, would simply float on top.
screenjunkies ride or die? AND WHY ONLY ONE TSHIRT FOR WOMEN?! I WANT THE HONEST TRAILER ONE :(
screenjunkies Bryce Dallas Howard as Dr. Crusher
screenjunkies Charles ShaughnessyBradley CooperMichael Jay WhiteTom HiddlestonJon Michael HillSibel KekilliLily TailorDanai Gurira...and if you REALLY want to count Wesley in,.... Nathan Vetterlein
screenjunkies NNNNNooooooooooooo!!!! These fucking movies should have NEVER BEEN MADE AT ALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies no no no no no no NO NO NO NO NOOOOOOOOOO!
screenjunkies Bryan cranson is not playing anymore bald characters. Get over it fanboys. Breaking bad is over.
screenjunkies Lol lets keep it Whoopi
screenjunkies I would prefer Hugh Jackman over Walter White for Picard. I dont think I would be able to take Worf seriously if Terry Crews played him.
screenjunkies Samuel L. Jackson as Worf, because a Klingon that says mother fucker a lot would be pretty sweet.
screenjunkies i think JJ abrams should be the janitor on some of the upcoming good movies so he has a chance of picking up some pointers on how to direct . Seriously star trek he turns spok into a gibbering cry baby , kirk into a dumb jock , uhuru into a complete idot , scotty into a skinny retard and rehashes all the ship design . the movie should have been star trek with great effects new ships and setting designs a story that was just not possible to visualise in the 70s and even further story developement of the series , instead we get twenty somethings with teenage problems in a disney theme park ride , for the love of god get him away from star wars
screenjunkies Patrick Stewart will always be the best
screenjunkies I just backed Zack. Thanks for the reminder. I might have totally forgotten to add his project.
screenjunkies I find it hilarious how only 746 was raised XD
screenjunkies Yes thank you. This bullcrap with celebrities asking for money for freaking vanity projects is making me sick. You assholes have money and the resources to find your own backing. Kickstarter is for those that do not. fucking leeches. I hope Zach Braff never works again.
screenjunkies Yeah...why dont we donate 2 million to keep people from making a movie. How about a 10 million dollar campaign to tell people what they shouldnt spend their money on.
screenjunkies Yeah...why dont we donate 2 million to keep people from making a movie. How about a 10 million dollar campaign to tell people what they shouldnt spend their money on.
screenjunkies Screen junkies sure sounds mad. Y u mad, screen junkies?
screenjunkies This is dumb. Ive lost respect for screen junkies.
screenjunkies Dont back Zack! you guys have fallen for his bullshit like a couple of scrubs.
screenjunkies But he is also a multimillionaire.
screenjunkies Oh dear Id never put my mum through that haha
screenjunkies that film is a bad porn movie :P
screenjunkies I feel sorry for your mom
screenjunkies Ok so I really dont think silence of the lambs is gory. I found it more creepy than anything else. But the 2nd human centipede is way worse in so many ways. The first film was gross but not as bad as I was expecting. I would not watch it again though.
screenjunkies dude, your mum is awesome
screenjunkies the first human centipede is horrible and boring, saw the second one and i loved it, awdward, gross, horrifing great movie
screenjunkies i want someone to make a reaction video to her reation.
screenjunkies The Lone Ranger is NOT a family movie
screenjunkies You know, I don t know why you people didnt like Iron Man 3 or Man of Steel, Iron Man 3 was great, most of you guys say it was full of plot holes, I found a explanation for all of them (except the operation part at the end) and I liked the plot twist, because this is the Marvel CINEMATIC Universe, not the Marvel Universe, are you guys just going to get angry at Age of Ultron because they are making their own Ultron Origin Story without Hank Pym in it? As for Man of Steel the only thing that I didnt like was the fact that Superman killed Zod. Of course this is only my opinion.
screenjunkies Its funny watching this vid in 2014, knowing how many of those movies, did infact SUCK.
screenjunkies HERE IT IS!!!!                            http:www.ign.comarticles20140110thehungergamescatchingfiretopplesironman3as2013sbiggestdomestichit?abthid52d0574ec75dfd6726000029
screenjunkies That guy on the left is an Assclown.
screenjunkies In iron man 3 he wasnt even in the suit twice, and the suit was barely even shown!
screenjunkies Star Trek and Pacific Rim were both epic movies, Grown ups 2 etc can go fuck themselves :
screenjunkies That awkward moment when you though iron man 3 was gonna be amazing, until you actually watched it in theaters and was severely disappointed.
screenjunkies Man of Steel was great! Christopher Nolan can do no wrong.
screenjunkies his friend maddawged me HA at least he noticed, that close of marky mark made me laugh so hard
screenjunkies I would love to have met Michael Clarke Duncan, but since he passed away not that long ago I wont be able to.
screenjunkies pain and gain was a pretty bad movie. best movie in ten years haha.
screenjunkies huge crush on emma stone.
screenjunkies Lol. You gotta control your fanboy.
screenjunkies bet this guy dose not watch wwf
screenjunkies omygosh i fully understand this. this is exactly how i feel about leonardo dicaprio. like, why is anybodys else presence necessary when youve got him in front of you? awesome dude (giveleoanoscar )
screenjunkies Pain  Gain is one of the worst movies ever made....All actors involved should sue for damages....even the key grip should get in on it.
screenjunkies mark looks really pissed off
screenjunkies veeeeeeeeeeei, FAA MAIS PF, TA MUITO BOM, CHORO DE RIR COM CADA UM.

screenjunkies I am Irish dude your f:(g racist
screenjunkies 1:38 and 2:35Words can not describe how much I laughed!!! XD
screenjunkies 24 had the best drinking game DAMMIT
screenjunkies Any reality or talk show, drinking Canadian Club or Jack Daniels. One swig if: someone cries, and wipes the tears with his fingers. Two swigs if: someone cries, and flicks the tears away with ginormous, clawlike fingernails.
screenjunkies A stoners piss ale for weeds.
screenjunkies And if a hot redhead shows up on screen...super jerk off.
screenjunkies CH3CH2OH  H20 is not beer, fools. It is pure ethanol (alcohol) plus water.
screenjunkies For years I was thinking that Osama ruling USA, I would not except that fault from Osama..
screenjunkies Nerd theme holiday needs to be Durins Day. :3

screenjunkies Just wasted 3 minutes and 32 seconds of my life.
screenjunkies IT TIME FOR NEEDCLEAR WAR !!!!
screenjunkies It tasted like a super gross butt because Obama is a super gross butthead. Wow, havent said butthead in ages...xD
screenjunkies The British The Office is indeed better the the US The Office.
screenjunkies Girls are actually stating to name their daughters renesmee.... Fuck... Its all over the internet... renesmee sounds like a white trash house cleaner name... Fuck poor kids
screenjunkies Srsly that staring thing cracks me up everytime. But really that Skeletor thing sold me.
screenjunkies whats the stare music?
screenjunkies say its peanut butter jelly time
screenjunkies Seriously this movie is beyond stupid, how come anyone enjoy this?!!
screenjunkies Theres a movie patrick stewart did called safe house.... I think it would put this entire saga to shame. I consider it the worst film ever made. I am amazed it didnt kill patricks career.
screenjunkies Dude am I the only one who thinks that Kristen is hotter as a vampire
screenjunkies Pretty much what twilight is ...... a bunch of crap
screenjunkies and the inability to use toothpaste. hahah holy crap
screenjunkies Well, thats 26 minutes of my life that ill never get back...
screenjunkies I LOVE the stares so much!!!But I couldnt watch the whole thing. I just couldnt do it...I made it to 3:30...
screenjunkies i made it two minute two
screenjunkies Stupid video waste of time !
screenjunkies OK I get a brownie badge for watching the whole thing.
screenjunkies There is a special corner booth in heaven for the people who had to edit these movies into this stareathon. I only made it 2:35 into it. Sorry, but my commitment level is not intense enough to subject myself to Twilight without the mockable dialogue, etc.
screenjunkies hahaha it looks like some kind of modernartexperimentalmovie
screenjunkies Lasted a minute and a half with all those creepy stares. My respect to anybody being a masochist enough to last 26 minutes of this cinematic torture.
screenjunkies I love how you wave goodbye
screenjunkies Oh my God, Rudnick !! That suit has got to go. Were you a Salvation Army Store model in a previous life ?
screenjunkies did anyone notice how uncomfortable this episode was? i thought hal wanted to leave from the beginning especially if you notice he started to say something before the overlord voice finished introducing the showing... maybe just me but it felt very forced almost as if they felt obligated to do this episode. I still loved it just felt kind of weird.
screenjunkies So John Travolta has mispronounced something for two straight oscars.
screenjunkies When did the screen junkies become TMZ?
screenjunkies I know you think you are funny but you actually are not. Accepted it and stop doing these kind of video.
screenjunkies You look just like PeeWee Herman!!!
screenjunkies I WANT THE ACTION FIGURES IN THE BACKGROUND O.O
screenjunkies it would be nice to see cyclops and jean resurrected some how, anyway i think the movie may have already screwed up because of the fact ONCE AGAIN the story revolves around wolverine
screenjunkies Hulk...Wolverine...Spiderman....and The Tick...lmao jk...ummm....Dr. Strange or Green Arrow (the one from the tv show)
screenjunkies Wolverine and the Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D.
screenjunkies i agree with Alison .. I LOVE GAMBIT
screenjunkies YES! all Marvel is crap since mickey mouse is the boss!!!
screenjunkies so are you going to do a Godzilla Trailer?
screenjunkies I was just talking about the katana thing this afternoon!what a coincidence!
screenjunkies I would love them to introduce deadpool probably and attempt to make the x force team with phantom x also I would love them to either do hulk vs wolverine as I think that would be Awsome or bring beta ray bill into the thor movies
screenjunkies Best team up would be spiderman and deadpool
screenjunkies Are these girls actors?...
screenjunkies Ellen Ripley and Captain America
screenjunkies Testing out how classic movie romance plotlines would work in the real world...
screenjunkies Wonder Women on her back on the beach, the Invisible Man on top, and Superman flying over looking to get laid. Ouch!
screenjunkies That was in fact the moment when I stopped the vid, cause I lost all interest in these girls.
screenjunkies They dont get any of the references thus far ive got them all!
screenjunkies Ive learnt women are self involved and uncultured from this video.
screenjunkies I thought GL Females were like 200lbs, Fat , Nasty, Missing Teeth, Drug users, Drunks, looking for their Prince Charmins, Soul Mates, True loves, have like 2 kids, looking for their Sugar Daddies, 3070 yrs old and just want to go for walks on beaches, snuggle at home, blah, blah, blah, Blah, BLAH!.....?
screenjunkies Star Wars is awesome you idiot.
screenjunkies naaa spongebob has the most epic half time show,,
screenjunkies Admirable, but what does this movie have to do with the Super Bowl Half Time Show?
screenjunkies Best half time show recreate the spongebob half time show (sweet victory) with a guest appearence of morgan freeman
screenjunkies Best half time show ever would be the Epic Voice saying various phrases (like he should be doing at the end of the Screen Junkies Show)
screenjunkies Nicolas Cage appears and sings some Rare Earths old tracks. While hes doing it, his hair just change forms in all the hair styles he had in all his roles. In the end, his head starts to burn and he flee with a flaming pepsi motocycle.
screenjunkies Best half time show: The Avengers reenact Magic Mike. ScarJo will play Mike.
screenjunkies I CANT DO IT GOOD LOL.
screenjunkies I would let that redhead ride my broomstick.
screenjunkies Trust me dude, if there was a spell to make your dick bigger it would be on the front page of my book of shadows. In fact I would throw out my old book of shadows and start a new one with penis maker bigger spell on the front page and get more pussy spell on page two.
screenjunkies he was being such a douche
screenjunkies witches are people who believe in mother earth and father sky. i am a witch and the way that we are seen in the media is just all wrong. we dont eat children, nor own any flying monkies, nor fly on broom sticks. we cast spells, worship the earth and all that was given to us through her, and are peaceful human beings.
screenjunkies Selfish evil creatures.Oh, I want a parking spot so Ill just force someone else out of it.
screenjunkies I used to really like screen junkies but this video is fing stupid. I think every one has a right to believe in what they want to and these women are Wiccan and you invite them to see this movie that makes their religion into a joke and a gimmick to then make them into jokes themselves. I am not Wiccan, I dont really have a religion but this would be the same as a movie making Jewish peopleschristian peoplesMuslim peoples ect..out to be monsters children eaters and evil. Real Pagans and Wiccans through out history have had their way of life ripped from them like most others. They have been killed and run out and had their cultures morphed into tacky plastic cauldrons and hats..I think you guys are a holes and can go f yourselves.
screenjunkies they go on about witches being portrayed badly but dont they end up having a witch being the good guy in the end ?
screenjunkies I think the way he treated these three woman was horrible. This is their religion. Would you sit down and disrespect a Catholic, Muslim or a Jewish persons faith in such a way? Just because you do not believe in a religion does NOT give you the right to belittle someone elses beliefs, even if it is not considered to be a mainstream religion or even if people do not understand it. Not only did you question their religious beliefs continuously through the interview which you would never do it a Christian person, you were rude, down right offensive and it was obvious how uncomfortable you made these three woman feel.
screenjunkies WE NEED MORE OF THESE CELEBRITY VISITS!!!!
screenjunkies The best way to kill an zombie is to show them twilight
screenjunkies Catch a zombie, place brains inside the head of the zombie. He will rip his own head into pieces to get the brain.
screenjunkies Rob Corddry was the worst and least convincing zombie in that movie. He wasnt struggling to talk at all, he was just whispering.
screenjunkies Kill zombies? You monsters! Havent you seen Fido?
screenjunkies Nick James .and thatAll Folks
screenjunkies a twilight movie they will kill themselves
screenjunkies I would show the zombie your video. It would die from boringness
screenjunkies noones fav character. you got that right
screenjunkies Schindlers List functioning shower and mass grave set.
screenjunkies Im surprised nobody said that action figures and toys are aimed at kids... What sort of parent lets their kid watch Django? Anyway I dont think its offensive to make action figures out of anything as long as theyre responsible about its marketing
screenjunkies Its an older movie, but characters from Salo...
screenjunkies the birth of a nation, sorry... but he asked
screenjunkies the wolf of wall street. comes with action figure condom )
screenjunkies zombie strippers action figures.
screenjunkies did the guy at 1:46 say Arnold Soldiernigga???? lmao
screenjunkies legenda the walking dead por favor
screenjunkies So many people say that the Amazing SpiderMan film was so much better than the first Spidey film. I was one of them for the longest time, but as the hype kinda wears off, I can easily say that both films were better than each other in certain aspects. Both were great in their own ways. SpiderMan had a more compelling villain. The Amazing SpiderMan had better supporting characters (besides Aunt May). Both did great jobs with Uncle Ben. SpiderMan was a more rewatchable movie (Probably due to its lighthearted nature). The Amazing SpiderMan had a better Peter Parker and SpiderMan as a whole. The Amazing SpiderMan had a much better New Yorkers help out Spidey scene (Crane operator with a debt to Spidey aids in quick travel for injured hero vs. random NY citizens with preplanned speeches for Goblin and cars full of rotten food and misc. junk to throw while Spidey saves perpetually screaming redhead and kids). SpiderMan had a more memorable music score (The strings and percussion played in a way that totally gave the score a creepy spider movement vibe, whereas I hardly remember TASM score and I watched it for the 15th time, yesterday). Its really hard to be subjective because I grew up on SpiderMan cartoons, so I fell in love with the first two Spidey movies. Heck, my first comic was a SpiderMan comic. But we have to face the reality that neither of the two franchises are perfect, but they have their moments. I really hope that Marvel doesnt get the movie rights for Spidey back for a while, because we all know what theyd do with him (see Ultimate SpiderMan cartoon on Disney Channel). Id like to grow old and die before I ever see Spidey ruined like that on the big screen!
screenjunkies Was dissappointed with this episode guys ..sorry!...I was waiting for SANTA to lean across the table and make NICK the NEW SANTA!! ..He touches NICKS chubby little finger ..THEN....(cue sparkles!.. stars and mystical whirlwinds!..) .........TA DAH!!....NICK would have looked down at his new red costume..and said....:OH!..MY!...GOD!....I LOOK SO FKN AWESOME!!!!......AND ex santa SAYS .. OK...Now that thats over with!...SHOW ME MORE shit movies!!...
screenjunkies The Razzie award was made by people that failed at everything in Hollywood and then came up with an award to takeout theyre anger and hatred on those who succeeded.Just like people who become movie critics.
screenjunkies Nick Mundy is incredibly annoying and talks over everyone. Yelling something really loudly does not make it fact. He makes it really hard to enjoy any screen junkies show he is in.
screenjunkies worst director M. Night Shymalan
screenjunkies Every unknown actor from the last airbender
screenjunkies Why does everyone hate on Tyler perry so much. I think made a is funny as hell I get maybe its cheap humor but hes still crazy funny. :)
screenjunkies Nick Mundy is hated so much. He needs to change his act.
screenjunkies Die Hard has the biggest fall from grace of any action movie franchise.At this point its like a Scooby Doo cartoon Every time John ventures out to the grocery store for milk... terrorist hijinks ensue.
screenjunkies Die hard 1,2 and 4 were the best out of the whole films.
screenjunkies Only the good Die Hard
screenjunkies Die Hard 5 was fine... only part i agree with is needing more practical stunts and effects... death by helicopter? just throw a guy in a helicopter blade.
screenjunkies HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
screenjunkies the die hard movies are begining to die hard
screenjunkies y does he have a fake arm?
screenjunkies i only liked the fourth one because timothy olyphant was the bad guy, other then that...
screenjunkies Possible titles for the new Die Hard movie:  Go Big Or Die Hard  If Gives You A Lemon Die Hard  Die Harder Than Youve Ever Died Before

screenjunkies I just watched this film yesterday, and I have returned with a totally new perspective about superman.
screenjunkies hell i would fuck superman and im not even gay.
screenjunkies Super man is definitely way different than that one dude.
screenjunkies Johnny Depp couldnt play Edward Cullen.

screenjunkies Hal you looks like he could be the son of Pee Wee Herman . Could you do and impression of himon the next episode ?
screenjunkies Okay this guy is horribly unfunny, just remembered why I only watch honest trailers and avoid everything else on here.
screenjunkies when they were still upstairs near the end the girl on the left looked like she was gonna slit someones throat 0.0
screenjunkies I feel really sorry for the children of the girl who wanted to name her daughter Renessme.

screenjunkies Damn, I wanted to see Snow white in the slave leia outfit.
screenjunkies Sabastian just made my fucking day LOL
screenjunkies I would watch it... but I am pretty sure I am not the only one
screenjunkies I still dont understand why people are so pissed about Disney buying the Star Wars franchise. At the very worst, people ignore the new movie...but the chances are, it will be awesome.
screenjunkies What kind of audition is this? You knew what this was.
screenjunkies Prequel fanboys think this is what Disney is actually going to doing. Whatever they do its gonna be better than what Lucas did for the special edition and prequels.
screenjunkies Im with ryanrightnow, without honest trailers you would be homeless. Or just have a different job.
screenjunkies I wasnt even paying attention at the beginning, I was too busy looking ant the South Park figures.
screenjunkies Use the force on a old Chinese lady, if she speaks english and understands you, she will listen...mwahahhahahha
screenjunkies Hahahah this is the best.
screenjunkies Awesome true Jedi mind trick! for real! :)
screenjunkies Hal Rudnick has the uncanny resembles to PeeWee Herman at 4:27... Right?!? Back off Cuz!
screenjunkies best part of this video is seeing hal with a weird yellow tantint?
screenjunkies People need to get a sense of humor
screenjunkies This is NOT funny. This is just being a prick and a douchebag. And stealing. And harassment. Stop doing things like this.
screenjunkies Dammit Peter Jackson, even two was enough, three was ample but four!?! Ergh
screenjunkies She was clearly coming on to me, I laughed so hard at that.
screenjunkies Its crying ow hot hot
screenjunkies Lol that MJ lookalike was really creepy and had a really really giant nose.
screenjunkies Thats not real Oh god, the irony.
screenjunkies Ah, come on, I like how he is an ignorant asshole while looking actually interested in what people do and talk...
screenjunkies do more celebrity ghost hunting
screenjunkies Why is Honey Boo Boo famous? Ive seen the show and I dont get it, I just dont get it. Whats so great about watching a fat, probably inbred, child being incredibly stupid?
screenjunkies Please do The Warriors Way!
screenjunkies omg, IT can read honeyPOOPOO
screenjunkies 4:03 honey boo boo is fappin
screenjunkies If a good portion of America were like this family they would have diabetes, heart problems and gout, oh wait.......
screenjunkies Honey boo boo is so weird
screenjunkies LMAO THATS NOT AN ACT . THERE FKING STUPID. And I agree with you.Stupid is Chic in this country. If someone on these hick show showed a trace of intellegence they would burst into flames like a vampire in sun light
screenjunkies We hate them too. Trust me. Between them and jersey shore they give us an awful name.
screenjunkies So many cool actors linked to Honey Boo Boo? Seriously mate, you could have used them in such a more amusing way.
screenjunkies CHRISTOPHER WALKEN SAYING VAJIGLE JAGGLE! pure internet gold
screenjunkies This is pretty funny!
screenjunkies The first part of this video with Christopher Walken, Sam Rockwell, and Colin Farrell is absurdist bliss.The second part where the poor guy actually eats sketti? Well... just dont do that, OK? Youll thank me later.via JulianSimpson1 on Twitter
screenjunkies you look like one huge shitty pussy, you know that?
screenjunkies Heres a tip: dont eat sketti.
screenjunkies I feel physically ill whenever I see the Sketti, I think Ive discovered my Kryptonite. Blaargghfff.
screenjunkies Christopher you really have to find a write to write a script for you to play Howard Zinn. You would win an oscar for this role.
screenjunkies Super Vagina haushaushaushaushasa
screenjunkies Frequncia cardaca sincronizada UAHSUhsauHSUAhsuHS
screenjunkies SUPER VAGINA ehuehuehue
screenjunkies have you ever thought about recording accompanied by other instruments such as guitar and bass? I think that would be fantastic too.
screenjunkies DR MANHATHAM ASUAHSHUSAUHSAUHSAUHASUHAUHSAUHSAUHS
screenjunkies ja tinha percebido que eles se comunicavam sem fones , mas esse trailer honesto me fez ver que os vingadores nao  tao bom assim :(
screenjunkies bane gayyy kkkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies A cota de super heris do mesmo filme para o Quarteto Fantstico foi preenchida pelo Tocha Amrica
screenjunkies Que isso, adoro o Capito Amrica!
screenjunkies meio q n o ultimo filme do hulk tem esse negcio de ele controlar a raiva e talz..., mas sei l.

screenjunkies Im Albanian an i will take you!.... ...nah just joking i will kill you.
screenjunkies I saw this movie... just a few weeks ago... pretty good actually
screenjunkies I would watch this version of Looper .
screenjunkies As fake trailers go,this is right up there with The Shining recut and Scary Mary.
screenjunkies 12 monkeys  Bruce Willis goes back in time and sees his younger self Disneys The Kid  Bruce Willis goes back in time and sees his younger self Looper  Bruce Willis goes back in time and sees his younger self WHAT IS IT WITH BRUCE WILLIS STARRING IN MOVIES WHERE HE GOES BACK IN TIME AND MEETS HIMSELF!?!?
screenjunkies does everyone seriously think this is a real trailer? stupid people
screenjunkies Im a total idiot, I thought it was real.. :P
screenjunkies Why is everybody saying Hello, Jovem Nerd???
screenjunkies The truly sad part, IThis trailer is more interesting than some other, real movies currently out.
screenjunkies you have to have the right attitude for the avengers. no its the best movie ever. no its not a good movie in the sense of plotstory.but it IS entertaining. and it DOES have a plot, no matter how simple. (unlike transformers).
screenjunkies i cant belive the little girls comment... Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 really?!?
screenjunkies you should have gone to chills
screenjunkies do a video with watchmojo.com
screenjunkies I gotta agree with you on hating the Chihuahua Movie girl! When I saw the Chihuahua movie trailer in theaters and rightfully boycotted that movie by not seeing it, and I saved a few million braincells by doing so! Some kids dont have souls! Viva the Avengers!
screenjunkies Not trying to be racist, but that little girl is too young and mexican to be liked.
screenjunkies That little girl. Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2... just... I cant.
screenjunkies I HATE THESE PEOPLE!!
screenjunkies the little girl... ..
screenjunkies he needs to interview Sandra Bullock... coz she speaks German LOL would be interesting to see both speaking German together haha
screenjunkies a friend of a friend will show it to you...and then you will enjoy it... :P hahah youre hilarious
screenjunkies WHAT? He should have ended with DANCE! :(
screenjunkies I so wished I lived in Flulas world
screenjunkies i love your accent xD
screenjunkies Omg I love Flula. He does a lot of hilarious stuff on his YouTube channel.
screenjunkies Wow, Susan Sarandon comes off as a real bitch here.
screenjunkies biggitydiddity I want to chickmcfuckit your chickenmcnugget!
screenjunkies Dumb. Chrimbus Special is a SPECIAL and not a movie, and The Comedy only has them in it, its not their movie. The Comedy is not written or directed by them. Also, what the fuck is Millionaire Dollar Movie?
screenjunkies Was expecting like Harry Potter or something. I think those are just normal mushrooms. Sorry guys :
screenjunkies You could tell it was a joke because I highly doubt one half of Tim and Eric could crumble into a mess like that over one hit of mushrooms. Still funny though.
screenjunkies this is fake as shit. Being on shrooms isnt like that.
screenjunkies nothin like a good old spoof n goof
screenjunkies Lol, Tim and Eric dont do drugs. Its an act. They frequently lampoon the notion that their comedy routine is inspired by the use of psychoactive drugs in their show. Theyll often say theyre on drugs and demonstrate cliched druginfluenced behavior to an awkward extreme in order to show how silly it is to assume overthetop absurdity must be inspired by drugs.
screenjunkies a great spoof and a goof
screenjunkies O MY GOD THE BROWNIE MOUNTAIN ONE MUST HAVE BEEN SO INTENSE
screenjunkies why would you make a video about peoples last words and then play loud ass music over it?
screenjunkies That was a really well edited mash up, especially the end. Nicely done!
screenjunkies how did it not have the bladerunner death scene?
screenjunkies and wat movie is 2:42
screenjunkies PRIME!!!!, i cried like a little bitch when i was a kid
screenjunkies Cant hear what they are saying : Music to loud :(
screenjunkies Wheres Fly You Fools???
screenjunkies how was sean bean not on here even once. U need to answer me this screen junkies
screenjunkies got a bit sad at the end :(
GameSack It really was an impressive port. Only a few effects got toned down. The biggest was when you touch fuzzy and get dizzy.
GameSack Scott  Chris are my favourite people in the world, this is hilar!
GameSack I bet half the time they play games in that place. Xxx
GameSack Love how scott goes proper red lol
GameSack This was really funny, you should do more of these!!
GameSack That was amazing but still not as funny as Chris Stark riding the elevator in his boxers
GameSack I made a note of it,  will probably look at mods sometime after Halloween.
screenjunkies Lots of F words hahahaHey guys! Just started up my YouTube channel about a month ago and it consists of me giving reviews on movies, games, and even talking about some recent movie news. Since it is still fresh, there is not a whole lot up right now, but it is definitely worth checking out!For those who do, thank you so much! It means the world to me listening to me talk about one of the things I truly love. Thank you :)
screenjunkies Seven hells you got me
screenjunkies A supercut of all the times they say Oh Geez in Fargo. please help screen junkies see this haha it would be amazing.
screenjunkies This is stupid, dastardly bastards.
screenjunkies No fucks were given that day
screenjunkies Fword freeforall   :P
screenjunkies i think its great that Arnie Grape gets a cameo in this film.
screenjunkies i feel the same thing about jenny she was the biggest bitch ever.
screenjunkies Terminator 2 or Starship Troopers. I dont know I love them both.
screenjunkies They should watch Spank the Monkey together
screenjunkies What about the crow brandon lee?
screenjunkies Natural Born Killers, amazing movie
screenjunkies Do the Best 80s movies! I love the 80s! Everybody who loves the 80s start demanding that they do a Best 80s movies episode!!!!!!!
screenjunkies Where the hell did you get this panel??? You mean to tell me that you guys didnt discuss the greatest Scifi  Action movie of ALL TIME???..... TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY!!! What an injustice.
screenjunkies Hate the freaking advertisments on youtube. Worse is sometimes you cannot skip them.
screenjunkies say if titanic didnt sink Leonardo DiCaprio had an oscar
screenjunkies Definitely one of the worst movies ever. Cant believe I watched 1 hour of this before deleting it.
screenjunkies Say : omg he kills kenny, you bastard
screenjunkies Say Kick out the epic motherfker
screenjunkies Say EA Sports  Its in the game!
screenjunkies honest trailer: Captain Philips
screenjunkies Say this: Why doesnt anyone ever ask me what I want to say?
screenjunkies True detective pleeeease!
screenjunkies actually do it pacific rim meets Independance day and jurrasic park for the 4th movie cause IT GOT DINOBOTS
screenjunkies Put in the You Got the Touch song from the original movie and then hit megatron with a freighter! wait, hes dead right? Then, um then make Grimlock pick up the freighter in his mouth and hit the main antagonist with it!... Please?
screenjunkies god, hel looks so raged about this guy :DD
screenjunkies Age of Extinction will hopefully be better as Bay said he realised that these films should be more like the last hour of dark of the moon......... clap clap good job Michael. But then again he admitted revenge of the fallen sucks but probably just to get us to see Dark of the moon
screenjunkies Its funny cause hes fat
screenjunkies Anyone else think Nick is an annoying fat shit who is about as funny as a high speed car crash?
screenjunkies How to fix Transformers:Put The Rock in It
screenjunkies So true, but Transformers is boss, but theres too much cursing in the 2nd one. My favorite is the 3rd one and my second is the 1st one.
screenjunkies I agree, the Humorous Scenes just make it super awkward. I mean, WE CAME TO SEE ROBOTS BEATING THE SHT OUT OF EACH OTHER NOT THE MAIN CHARACTER HAVING A FUNNY SPASM THING!!!
screenjunkies its a new movie but I would have put the worlds end in here for some humor, I saw it without knowing anything of the premise and I literally stared at the screen for 5 minutes thinking I was hallucinating something
screenjunkies What is the movie at 2:26?
screenjunkies God damn it you spoiled everything!
screenjunkies Do a trailer for home alone 2 lost in New York
screenjunkies Unbreakable had a pretty decent twist and in my opinion is Shamalamadingdongs finest film.
screenjunkies didnt actually give away Se7en completely
screenjunkies stop with the spoilers u dicks
screenjunkies Am I the only one who likes Brans plot line
screenjunkies Episode 9.. That was totally heart stabbing. All people that I thought was the main character is dead shhh, now I just hope that George RRM wont kill Arya. And I havent seen Season 4 yet.
screenjunkies I remember the fuckin aggro crag... damn it.
screenjunkies Joffery actually is a literal bastard.....right?
screenjunkies The dynamic between Brienne of Tarth and Jaime Lannister, during season 3, really worked for me. They came together out of practicality, but do watch out for each other out of some level of human compassion... something especially not generally observed in Jaime. They still have no hesitation to snipe at each other and hold different values, but Brienne managed to bring out in the kinkillingchildkilling Jaime an unprecedented sense of compassion for someone other than himself and Cirsei. That it was never a romance between the two made it all the more awesome.
screenjunkies Ow my favourite part of season 3 is NONE OF IT BECAUSE GAME OF THRONES IS SHIT there is too much crap going on, my idiotic human brain cant keep track and the only reason I watched this video was because I thought Id give game of thrones another chance but it only confirmed for me that game of thrones IS SHIT and so is walking dead
screenjunkies you guys are gonna be so pissed at Dany this season, lol your lucky you didnt have to suffer through what her self doubts for hundreds of pages at least. also this isnt a spoiler im just lowering your expectations.
screenjunkies The way I see it, Bran becomes everybodys best hope. Arya becomes even more badass, but I have a feeling she will wreck the wrong shit and fuck up everything for everybody. Just a hunch though.
screenjunkies ERIC YOUNG IS WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION!
screenjunkies That R  L  J is one big ass spoiler if some no book reader gets it.
screenjunkies Lord Friend Zone really wants some of that Thargaryan pussy. Im afraid hes not going to get it before the last dawn sets upon him.
screenjunkies Lord Friendzone killed me :D
screenjunkies Lol king jutin bieberU killed it hahaha
screenjunkies Littlefinger made Lysa Tully murder her husband, Jon Arryn.
screenjunkies the fck with the censoring, are you complete retards?
screenjunkies TOO. MUCH. CGI. Holy shit. The reason the live action movies were so fun was because of the fight choreography that was done in the suits. The one guy says that itll be a more interesting Transformers movie because of the personalities. CGI characters always have less personality. Itll rake it some cash but Im afraid it wont have the longevity that some of us had hoped for.
screenjunkies I have many problems about the new TMNT movie, for starters i wouldve loved if the movie was inspred by the new Nickelodeons TMNT cartoon, that cartoon has an awesome backstory for the turtles, it has the best chreder and master splitner ever made, adn also has the Turtles finally acting as teenagers, for the first time ever the turtles feel like unexperience teenagers who always are learning new lessons about life, and they have PERSONALITY, real personality, unique personality, but no the director of this new movie decided to fuck all that awesmoe work and do an extremly boring backstory
screenjunkies I dont see how this movie will mess up the franchise, because this is as close to real mutated turtles would look like. in past movies they looked more like oversized frogs, than turtles. the only thing that I dont like is that Shredder is some white guyscientist (no offense) smh. should have kept him asian.
screenjunkies Im cautiously optimistic. Bay is only involved in a producer sense so hopefully we dont just get a bunch of action blur and depth less characters.
screenjunkies Bay should just make porn.....lots of suckage
screenjunkies Megan as April... NO!!!!
screenjunkies looks better than the original any day
screenjunkies Am I the only one gettin mad watchin this..?? How much money did they pay you guys to sit there and kiss all tht hollywood ass and mislead die hard turtle fans?
screenjunkies I am excited about the movie, but I am not sure Michael Bay is the right choice, the Transformers are the prototype of a turd trilogy, lets hope someone kept him from filling the movie with explosions
screenjunkies imma see the movie frist before i give my opinion cuz im not a douche bag
screenjunkies You should do Divergent, Im about to finish the book
screenjunkies do the winter soldier now
screenjunkies Robert Downey Senior xD
screenjunkies THE WINTER SPOILER XD....ROBERT DOWNEY SR!!!! XD
screenjunkies PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!! DO TAKEN
screenjunkies Go juice! Lol Do Winter Soldier!
screenjunkies I love how on most of the dials the name Stark are engraved.
screenjunkies About 80 of Gangster No. 1. Theres also this one scene in the first episode of the One Missed Call TV series, girl got her neck slowly severed by a pane of glass sliding off from the back of a lorry while she was trapped behind it, watching as the pane just slide slowly her way. It was a while before I could sit near windows.
screenjunkies Anything by Aronofsky, that guy is very sick... I wish I never get exposed to any movie hes involved ever again, I had to make a freakin study out of Requiem for a dream, that movie is so fd up...
screenjunkies Shuts Eyes I cant hear you! I cant hear you!
screenjunkies Village of the damned 1995: In the first half of the movie when you see all the mothers give birth to the babies on the exact same day, you will notice that one of them seemed to have had a miscarriage, which Dr. Susan immediately takes away to her secret lab. Afterwards throughout the movie we see the children look like normal kids with just the same white hair, but then later on when Dr. Susan takes one of the fathers to her secret lab, we are shown what the still born baby looks like in its natural alien form, which in my opinion is the most WTF part in the movie.
screenjunkies the scene in the movie evil dead(2013). when the branch of the tree goes into her vagina...creepyy
screenjunkies My Achilles heel feels wierd
screenjunkies I can boil it down to the top 50!50. Natalie Portman cutting her cuticle in Black Swan49. The cheeseburger scene from Menace II Society48. Warren Beatty saying the nword in Bulworth47.

screenjunkies Its an easy answer a live action pokmon movie just not an Ash Ketchem character in the movie but do refrence the show and games
screenjunkies best ever?.....wreck it ralph...
screenjunkies Halo would always be the best game used in a film. While the best videogame film Ive watched would be Mass Effect: Paragon Lost, followed by the Tomb Raider film. I the best Ive watched because I think they are right. THE BEST has yet to be made.

screenjunkies LOL I THINK U ARE AWESOME
screenjunkies The claw got to me bru rmfao
screenjunkies Divergent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
screenjunkies 3:44 LOL i was thinking that the whole time i was watching it!
screenjunkies not bad cake boss, not bad LOL
screenjunkies I asked myself the same question, where do all the arrows keep coming from? And the claw :)
screenjunkies I want Nick Mundy to Host the Oscars.
screenjunkies The Tupac hologram should host the 2015 Oscars!
screenjunkies Bill Murray wants to host, but they wont let him

screenjunkies it will still be better than any recent dc movies
screenjunkies I expect this film to be completely shit, Id be highly surprised if Im wrong.
screenjunkies Is it gonna flop or is it gonna pop? thats what she said
screenjunkies Boooooooooooooooootista
screenjunkies I love the idea of it but I just bet this movie is gonna bomb! The thing that made the avengers popular was that the heroes were built up through individual movies and then put together. Thats what made it such a success. These characters arent even nearly as well known as the avengers and havent even had a real introduction. Marvel have not advertised the movie well enough. Im not even sure what audience this movie is aimed at! There are parts that look like theyre made for kids and other parts that look more for adults! I seriously have a bad feeling about this one and Im sure Im not the only one.
screenjunkies the mother fucker in the jumper wont let any one else speak
screenjunkies Thumbs up if you watched gravity on your phone :P

screenjunkies Please do The Mentalist! loved it, but it deserves an Honest Trailer guys!!
retrogametech yay, I knew youd return :Dedit: If you are having trouble finding new consoles to buy and fix you should just buy random broken consoles and try to fix them as a challenge and see if you can resell them for a profit
retrogametech Ha ha!!! Nice! Easiest fix ever.
retrogametech Very lucky and awesome! I live over in the USA and I have to say the UK plugs are way better then ours, even though they are bigger.
retrogametech You lucky git :) well done. That must be the buy of the year for you
retrogametech That is cheap for a Vectrex. I think this is one of the most interesting things you have fixed I have seen you do not many of these around so the more working the better.
retrogametech I think they have one of those at the leeds media museum
retrogametech yaaay you are back :)
retrogametech The only time Ive ever played one of these was at the Insomnia 49 gaming festival. The camera really doesnt do the display justice. Im assuming its electron beams that make up the shapes, but Im not sure.
retrogametech played the same console in game in glasgow a few year ago, hink they were selling it at the time for 80 odd quid, 26 quid is a steal, nice find man :P
retrogametech Those are an impressive set of blue balls.
retrogametech I found them at The Works, there were only 2 left, the two in this video! :)
retrogametech I got Metal, Super, and Knuckles. The three best!
retrogametech really cool man good to see you back man!
retrogametech This is odd, but cool at the same time, pretty detailed too.
retrogametech Unintentional ASMR video. :3
retrogametech Aww Yea RetroGameTech is back :D. I hope you had great holidays and a happy new year. Also do you know where to get GBA Micro faceplates from?
retrogametech I never tire of this mellow flow Martin has.
retrogametech I look forward to guys like you and lukemorse1 the most ! missed the vids !
retrogametech not sure if you will see this but do you have a neo geo pocketpocket color? if not you might want to have a look at them they look really fun although there isnt a huge library i think only around 80 games? and a lot of fighting games. I like collecting handhelds as well although my collection isnt nearly as good as yours
retrogametech Soon as they are available in France
retrogametech hi mate keep up the good work and very nice collection of retro handhelds love watching your videos mate also from scotland myself in glasgow mate
retrogametech good vid mate, love the vids )
retrogametech Great to see you back and posting great vids. Hope you decide to continue.
retrogametech I missed you, glad your back. Google really needs to give up and just let Facebook have the social network crown.
retrogametech glad to see one channel that isnt getting spammed by the bobs army bullshit. and great job getting the smart card to work!
retrogametech Awesome you got it working! Youtube is filled with great helpful people :)
retrogametech can you tell me what hardware you exactly used on the video and what to search for on e bay (etc.)?would be really nice!because I dont know what to search for ( I tried but found nothing )
retrogametech Does the GBWriter also read gameboycolour games?
retrogametech you like cant find it any were i tryed amazon ebay and cregslist it is not there
retrogametech Looks the same as EZflash 1 I still own I have the software if you want to try it give me a note and i see if i can upload it for you later on
retrogametech Fingers crossed for you finding drivers, would definitely be useful backing up saves and maybe even getting saves online with all characters unlocked etc.
retrogametech Left a comment on your channels discussion page with some possible links. Best of luck!
retrogametech That is an ez flash 4 i have the same one, great little thing.
retrogametech Hi martin, Im looking to get an ez flash cart but cant seem to find one, any advice?
retrogametech http:www.hkems.comdownload2020Transferer2012.htmDid some looking around, and found some similar software that might just be compatible. I have no idea, but I guess you could try it out.Keep up the good work on the videos!
retrogametech http:www.mediafire.comdownload40yrylf0sq3msduewin0.66.rarThat should be it...
retrogametech Can you make a tutorial for the homemade gbc cart?
retrogametech Thanks for the shout Martin, glad you like the bootlegs thought they might go nicely with your scorpion etc! Tbh I havent really given Strider 2 much time, only tested it but I love the two shmups, I couldnt tell the difference between those and the originals.
retrogametech hey i have a few broken game systems, if you want to trade or anything let me know
retrogametech It wouldnt let me comment until I upgraded my account to use Google, this is seriously annoying.. Anyway, the language on the back of the Strider 2 cartridge is Korean. Any time you see characters that look like space invaders spaghetti hoops with all the circles and straight lines its Korean.
retrogametech Lol, you always say this but Ive been uploading every few days. :P
retrogametech Gah... dont buy bootlegs... and avoid Hong Kong sellers
retrogametech Fucking love your videos. Please keep doing them.
retrogametech Sadly the zero mission game in the picture was just a picture he took from the internet. I have seen some sellers put up pictures of a game showing the nintendo logo on the pcb. I really appreciate that.
retrogametech Glad to see youre doing more videos. You should start doing Lets play series.
retrogametech Thanks. Already working on the hidden gems vid :)
retrogametech Would defiantly be interested in a best ofhidden gems video, the GBA is a system that passed me by. I got a few when I bought my original DS, but thats about it.
retrogametech Thanks, appreciate it!
retrogametech I understand that Microsofts decision to name it the Xbox One is stupid, but that doesnt mean you can just reject it haha. The original Xbox IS just called the Xbox, and the new one IS called Xbox One.
retrogametech Are you selling one of your dream cast plz replay pm me if u got more dream cast plz thanks
retrogametech What kind of media player is that ? Im looking for something small like that for our game room here at the house .
retrogametech Cheers, dude. Hope to see a vid soon!
retrogametech The shelves? 10 from my local discount store. :)
retrogametech Im from just outside Glasgow :)
retrogametech Wheres your Hellghast figure? It was pretty neat!
retrogametech Yes, it makes absolutely no sense in why they got rid of them.
retrogametech I take it you like the black look! ) Very swish looking collection mate.
retrogametech That is camo in.gears pink dont paint it might be worth more one.Fay yo.gears fan well.cool Mabel I should do a video like thus some.time
retrogametech No he didnt Kind of a chill guy to talk to. He did do the Dom voice from time to time which was cool , but you could tell he had to change his face to do the voice. I dont know if that makes any sense but yeah lol
retrogametech The only software I have for it is the disc it came bundled with. Its all in Japanese so I have no clue how to use it effectively. I know you can do video chat, photo editing, and email. Not sure about games. I sacrificed 1 of the mats when I first got them. Cant bring myself to use the rest :P Tbh these prob arent my most obscure items. I thought I should try and show some stuff I hadnt previously (or at least recently) done vids on :) . Thanks for bringing TTT back from the grave! XD
retrogametech Nice items. I love the pink gun and video chat camera.
retrogametech I just bought one of these off eBay, probably from the same seller.Do you have instructions for building a supergun like the one youre using in the video ?
retrogametech I just had a thought... Do you know a lot about PC hardware?
retrogametech Are you getting a cabinet at some point?
retrogametech Didnt he mention a viewer from the UK sent him the board and a game? Probably from the same excess stock.
retrogametech Thats awesome dude. Nice one, classic games room have a review of samurai showdown.
retrogametech Man, I love your videos. Theyre always really insightful with plenty of cool content. You also just seem like a genuinely awesome and chilled guy, thanks for taking the time to make these. :)
retrogametech Yes, its the CRT. If youre younger, then it will likely sound louder. (Peoples hearing diminishes as they get older, and it gets harder to high the highpitched noise.) Its a noise you got used to years ago with CRT TVs and monitors. Proper retro sound. :p Doesnt bother me, but then I am getting quite old now. lol
retrogametech Haha, thanks dude. Been busy with work. I wish I had a bit more energy for making vids!
retrogametech And used by terrorist to set off bombs! xD
retrogametech Special tool XD, its just torx...
retrogametech Wait  do all dpads on Xbox 360 controllers spin like that? 2:11
retrogametech Watching this stuff really wants me to get some faulty stuff and repair it. Though I will have no idea what Im doing. Which is one of the reasons why I dont do it. XD Oh well. Thanks for the upload! Please upload abit more! D
retrogametech Didnt you used to have the old white 360? Also do you play online now? One last thing why dont you do videos repairing sony handhelds?
retrogametech Great video, may I ask what screw driver you used? Thanks
retrogametech I think the best thing to do is just buy a new controller every year or two. It doesnt matter how careful you are with them because they always wear out.
retrogametech Awsome...how about a lool in your parts bin? Sounds like a magical place. Enjoyed :)
retrogametech Dishwasher is overkill and a bit dangerous for certain components but i washed an entire CM full of oil (not kitchen oil, but motor) with a toothbrush and soap. If you protect the processor socket its ok.
retrogametech How is the sound? More videos?
retrogametech Id just use the original Genesis. Theyre very common, built to last and easy to fix if they ever go wrong. :)
retrogametech Yes, its Russian. I had one Mega Drive clone that looked like Fat PS1, but it worked like charm.
retrogametech You are welcome, mate! Glad you liked it! Btw, I can see Dendy Classic 2 at my local internet auction for a humble price of 200 USD. xD Good luck with that mission.
retrogametech Yay another Scottish techie YouTuber
retrogametech Mega Drives from Thailand? Sounds interesting...
retrogametech I have that Atgames Sega Genesis 80 games in one consoles. Its okay but the sound is off.
retrogametech Hah, I have this fake console in 2000 year! ) Russian fakes
retrogametech what is the name of the song at the end ??
retrogametech Use HDTune to check your free hdd for errors and bad sectors , its free and it will tell you the health status of the hdd
retrogametech Love a good waffle, great vid as always!
retrogametech Awesome find on the Sat box,wish i found stuff like this : Did the box work..why did they throw it?
retrogametech Nope, theyve 100 genuine. Ive been collecting GBA games for a few years now and can spot the bootlegs from a mile off :P. I only buy boots if theyre of weird ROM hacks or have interesting art. Anytime I make a vid featuring a fake cartsclones I make a point of talking about it.
retrogametech Duck Amuck is such a great idea for a game and its done really well. Shame you can see pretty much everything it has to offer in an hour or so.
retrogametech Free Hard drive, sweet :D
retrogametech I have the same Kasumi figure!
retrogametech Good idea but unfortunately I already junked the housing. But thanks for reminding me! I really need to get that CMVS project back on track! haha.
retrogametech Its hard to believe but there are some out there. My advice, stay away from American Dragon Jake Long on the DS. Just saying.. :P
retrogametech Retro Relics lol we have a pot shop called that
retrogametech I dont really have any PC games. I could actually list all of them right here in this comment! :P GTA Vice City, Super Meat Boy and now The Sims Complete Collection. And I use a really lowend Acer Revo R3700 PC running Windows 7 for pretty much everything. Haha, the pics are mostly of old friends from school. Nothing of interest :P
retrogametech Hi Martin. Ive been following your channel for about a year and I never took the time to write a comment about how good it is. I really enjoy your repair videos and all the obscure clone console stuff. Ive bought a copy of Guitar Hero On Tour (not the Decades version) for really cheap recently. My fingers hurts but Ive been able to make it to the final area in expert mode (but I dont think Ill be able to finish it). I Hope youll keep making fun videos.
retrogametech I really enjoy watching your videos. I do also dislike the PAL DS games, guess i have to switch them out. :P BTW: the XG Blast amzn DOT to16vgGTB
retrogametech hey i was wondering how to save data on games like super mario land and Go Go Tank
retrogametech I have the standard on tour version of guitar hero DS :)
retrogametech I really surprised you dont already have one with a bunch of the games! haha You can still find lots of the games sealed on ebay pretty cheap. Dont see the system very often though. Going to hold onto mine for now I think. But Ill let you know if I decide to sell it. Nice to hear from you btw!
retrogametech OH WOAH I forgot I had that GameBoy Camera, Ill have to go into the attic and try to hoak it out.
retrogametech Bummer that you didnt get enough footage for the Pokemon system. Even if you were unable to revive it, it would have been interesting to see what the insides looked like. I love it when you teardown and refurbish hardware. :D Nice pickups.
retrogametech They also came in dark gray.
retrogametech It had the 2 brightness settings and i could see it in the dark.
retrogametech It was also released in China as iQue GBA SP, its official and it had backlit screen. AFAIK in only was in silver and purple
retrogametech Australian AGS101 GBA SP data was added to the Nintendex! Australian AGS101 GBA SP: A backlit version of the GBA SP released in Australia. Rare and hard to find. It seems to come in Pearl Blue and has no Shiny variant yet.
retrogametech I have an Arctic Blue AGS101 which says AGS001 on the back.
retrogametech Try amazon or or a store called the exchange if you have one.
retrogametech There is this pirated console called the xgame 360 which is a ripoff of the xbox 360, you should check it out
retrogametech I will look into that. Thank you.
retrogametech Is the unibios really worth the extra money compared to a debug bios? Debug20 uni40
retrogametech I bought a modchipped xbox at the swapmeet maybe little under a year ago, Been a bitch to work with, I paid 10 but the parts ive put into it really kills it, and the harddrives pretty rotten from previous owner. 120gbs but its dying forsure, motherboard had grime and rust on it, entire inner metal shell was rust. Had to have been living outside or something.
retrogametech I was watching this on ebay, i was really tempted to bid. But decided not to because of the price of the games.
retrogametech I saw this on ebay but was put off by the chip and the megadrive power switch, if i had known somebody as good as you repaired it i would of been in.
retrogametech You dont actually need to press select if you only press start it works too
retrogametech Yeah, I was hoping you could too but sadly no option for that.
retrogametech For GBA you should definitely look into getting an EZFlash IV. I did a video on it a while back. But for GBGBC youll needwant GB USB smart card 64M. Hope that helps! :)
retrogametech Im not bother either way . Its written as Color on the console itself so not much point worrying about it. :P
retrogametech I just tried it with the Mario Kart Advance (from the ambassador program) and whilst it displays the game in the native resolution there isnt a GBA surround, just blackness :(
retrogametech Hey man , really enjoy your videos youre an inspiration for retro consoles collecting! I was wondering if the consoles you order from ebay or amazon come from the us or asia etc..how much do the UK charge you at customs for tax and all? also are you a seller on ebay?cheers
retrogametech Thanks for watching. Hope you get it running without too much work! :) Its a great console.
retrogametech Could you recommend some GB Cards? Any Names?
retrogametech I ordered a 360 HDDVD drive the other day from CeX, inc 3 discs total cost delivered was 12.50 :) It arrived today, Im very happy with it. I couldnt get discs to play on my laptop (laptop is too old), but the films (Apollo 13, The Big Lebowski  The Thing) all work well when connected to the 360. I picked those 3 films as the bluray versions actually look worse (DNR issues). But I doubt Ill be stocking up on titles, unless I can find another HDDVD addon for backup (oos online now at CeX).
retrogametech Have you tried an every drive with it?
retrogametech Have you managed to get in contact with Gary Smoke? Maybe he can somehow answer this problem, or at least direct you to the people who manufactured it and maybe they would know?
retrogametech I stumbled across this channel from Zero Wing music somehow... At any rate I love your technical videos! They are interesting to watch and they make me feel more intelligent that I really am, haha. Good work bud!
retrogametech wow looks like your almost their,sonic 3 and streets of rage 3 had special lock out technology applied to them stoping them working on ntsc mega drives,my friend had a Japanese mega drive and he brought sonic 3 day of release and could not play it on his mega drive i think it was the blue line of pal mega drive games that had this lock out technology but definitely sonic 3 and streets of rage 3,keep up the good work.was gonna ask are the wireless md joy pads and good? could you do a video please
retrogametech Getting even a vague form of life from the 32x on unofficial hardware is achievement enough! Good job!
retrogametech Hey Thomas! I was thinking the same about the Scorpions CPU clock being slightly off and causing an issue with the 32X. As you said, the freezing shouldnt happen if it was just a video sync problem. The oscillator rating on the clone is indeed different to that of my original MD. Now Im tempted to switch it out and test! haha Regular MD games have the same issue while played via 32X on Scorpion. Personally I believe the Scorpion is a Taiwanese clone. But nothing concrete to back that up.
retrogametech Will It Blend that is the question
retrogametech resident evil 4 and speed racer is very good as they are very action arcade like games. metroid other m is bad. get target terror and just dance 1.
retrogametech RE4 wii edition is the ultimate edition of RE4, feature wise. Its got better graphics over the cube and ps2 version, motion control, and most importantly, all the extra modes the ps2 version got.
retrogametech Miss the older platforms now its all about DLC and screwing the gamers out of as much cash as possible.
retrogametech Xenoblade Chronicles is by far the best game on the system.
retrogametech even if you dont like mario, try out super mario galaxy its one of the best 3d platformers ive ever played, it doesnt play like classic mario
retrogametech also you should find sonic colors, super smash bros, mario kart, donkey kong country returns, and metroid prime 3( i got that game for 3 dollars)
retrogametech If you have your wii softmodded id suggest trying the ScummVM interpreter if youre into point and click adventures. I found the Wii mote to be a perfect controller for these type of games. There is also a compilation of the Bit Trip Wiiware games called Bit Trip Collection on disc. Its a very addictive Atari 2600 era influenced PongDefender hybrid and you control the paddle by holding the wiimite horizontal and tilting it forwards and backwards.
retrogametech If you DO get Red Steel 2, you will need the Wii Motion Plus addon in order to play it, just a headsup for you
retrogametech Need for Speed Nitro isnt the best game on the system, but worth it if you find it cheap.
retrogametech Resident Evil games, Animal Crossing, Klonoa, Monster HUnter Tri, Tenchu: Shadow Asssassins  Sin and Punishment
retrogametech Its definitely a quirky little addon. Thanks for watching!
retrogametech Whats with the moonshell? Was you trying to see if other things would run? Or maybe just used an SD card from a backup cart you had music on already? Pretty cool though, wish I got one that cheap.
retrogametech No, you dingus. This is photoshop.
retrogametech Very cool device! Cant complain specially with that price :)
retrogametech Haaaa. Thats the Playyan. Never knew the released outside of Japan. Envious now...
retrogametech No, I havent tested that yet. Id guess it just switches the DS into GBA mode and looks the same. Will test later though.
retrogametech Hey man. I would like to see the part 2 of that neo geo video. Will you be doing one soon? Thanks man
retrogametech It was the only one and in the preowned tradein section so your best bet is maybe ebay or an indie game store. I dont think HMV themselves ever sold these. If they did it would have been many years ago.
retrogametech Whats the master system compatibility on this like? Have you tested any MS games on an everdrive as the real Megadrive had Master system hardware compatibility built in.
retrogametech I loved that shop. They had so many types of Micro Machines! Id have spend hours in there if Id been allowed, haha.
retrogametech Haha, yeah the sound on those AtGames clones can be a little wonky to say the least! There are lots of original Mega Drives on ebay very cheap these days though. Makes it a great console to collect for :)
retrogametech Did you mean to say the Master System converter? If so I hadnt even thought of that! :P I dont own one but it would be cool to test. Id guess it would work.
retrogametech Probably. Ive seen variants of this console posted in forums by US collectors.
retrogametech You can still watch it on YouTube :P And its weirdly even more enjoyable to watch now! haha
retrogametech Interesting clone system, and funny that the gaming show thought it was appropriate to advertise a clone system :)
retrogametech What, no love for the bootleg, Luke? haha Youd strip it for parts? Do you know how long Ive been looking for one of these Scorpion clones :P Was the Mega Drive successful over in Japan? Or was it not that popular? Here in the UK theyre all over ebay and carboot sales. There are so many of them that you can pick one up for next to nothing. SNES on the other hand is the complete opposite.
retrogametech Shame they only fitted 2 mod switches. What you have there is region lock and language, I have a clone called Mega Drive X that has 3 switches. Region, language and 5060Hz.
retrogametech The problem I had with sound just happened when I played that game all my another games worked perfectly
retrogametech This is the best bargain i have seen!! Well done mate. I think the unibios chips are different for the MVS, depending on the motherboard they just plug straight in (socket type) and i dont think you need to solder wires?? Or am i wrong
retrogametech Haha yes, it looks like I might have try and fashion an alternative.
retrogametech Yup, but its not the greatest, 2mbps only, but for now at least its good enough to what the youtubers I like, will do a update video soon though :)
retrogametech Great price and great ending. As Hannibal Smith used to say I love it when a plan comes together!!
retrogametech lol, yes i would. let me know when you want got get rid of them and the price you want. would love to take one of these bad boys of ya hands.
retrogametech Can you teach how these things?
retrogametech Neo Geo best fighting game console ever!
retrogametech Wow, excellent work. What a deal! You could easily make like 150 quid if you resold them, right? Looking forward to your update video.
retrogametech The GBA emulator on the Wii is pretty impressive! You probably enjoy messing around with that.
retrogametech Ah, that makes sense. Thanks for your response! :)
retrogametech Hey Martin, very nice cable management. Not messy at all. Also, lov da Outrun passing Breeze track playn n bkround
retrogametech I wish you would ome around my house and sort my cabling out, its a nightmare
retrogametech Really love watching your videos, plus this kind of made an updated entertainment setup tour of sorts! great cable management, I need to sort my cables out, theyre hidden well enough. Do you have any planned fix it videos in the works? Also are you still accepting room tours on your last video? I recently got my roomsetup into a condition Im content with. Wouldnt mind sharing it with you, seeing what you thought of it. Thanks for all the videos again btw, always entertaininginteresting.
retrogametech Great video as always, although (personally) I generally have an issue with adding scanline emulation to a game that was actually meant (originally coded and designed) for either a 480i (fake hires) or 480p (hires). Scanline emulation should be really left for 240p original content, that has been transferred to a 480ip encode. Saying all of though...... it can look rather pleasant when overlaying a progressive image, especially from a console with duboius quality output like the Wii. :D
retrogametech Hey, I wanted to ask you what can I do to use my consoles with a VGA monitor. Maybe via component or SCART.
retrogametech Thanks. Im never quite satisfied with it though. Theres always something else that could be streamlinedimproved :P
retrogametech Nice :) I need to get an SLG. How well does the cheapy scaler work when it actually scales the image up to 720p? In essence you are just using it as a pass through to the slg3000 right?
retrogametech Thanks. Couldnt believe it when I got the confirmation email on the controllers. I thought it was a mistake :P
retrogametech I still need to complete 12! :P
retrogametech Thanks. I remember hearing talk of a 3rd party circle pad pro that had a built in battery for extending the playtime of the console. Not sure if that ever got made though.
retrogametech Excellent video thanks for sharing! Have you had any problems with your PS3? Ive been told at GameStop that those older, bigger models are more likely to have issues then the newer, slimmer PS3s. But, they are cheaper, so Ive thought about getting one.
retrogametech Thanks for watching :)
retrogametech Keep up the great work. Love the vids
retrogametech That is a lot if consoles
retrogametech Id love to see a video of you going over all the flash carts you have. I find them just so intresting.
retrogametech Love the scanlines :) You should install Wiiflow on your wii then you can just load all your games on a USB hard drive and play them without discs.
retrogametech Passion to revive console games. nice!
retrogametech wow, that shows amazing dedication and patience! nice job.
retrogametech Awesome repair mate, another old classic get resurrected from the console graveyard.
retrogametech You are amazing!! Its so damn good to know there are people out there that can keep these old systems from dying out. Greetings from all the way over here in California.
retrogametech Astounding work, well done !!
retrogametech 6:03 SWEET JESUS THROW IT AWAY 9:55 very nice :) another blow against entropy :P
retrogametech Great job,youre obviously very skilled in console repairs. Watching this video reminded me of a memory from my childhood.I went to an independent games shop in Leeds with my mum back in the early 90s and the shop was packed.Everyone was buying Japanese megadrives in boxes.But I just didnt understand why there was so much interest in the funny looking megadrives at the time. Now looking back I wonder if the shop had modified the megadrives internally to operate with PAL TVs.
retrogametech Yep, the conversion looked like it was done in a hurry by someone who really didnt care.
retrogametech Awesome! I love the Lets Repair Series, Keep it up!
retrogametech Hey buddy ! Great Vid ! your just like the king of repairs ! anyways i wanted ask how much if you dont mind saying, you got your neogeo console for ? plus what were the games you were playing in the vid ? Thanks man !
retrogametech How would you approach the repair if you did not have any spare parts? Still possible?
retrogametech im looking for this controller so if someone has spare one to sell drop me msg thx
retrogametech You can buy replacement switches, I think allelectronics or digikey has some that are the same size. what are the dimensions of the switches in mm?
retrogametech How do you still play them games?
retrogametech Thanks! Im never quite sure if anyone will be too interested in watching me repair stuff like this.
retrogametech I doubt you shorted it. Its probably just got dirty contacts somewhere or maybe a worn cable.
retrogametech Pretty sure you cant. I wish you could though. They appear to be proprietary SNK and designed specifically to fit inside that black plastic housing.
retrogametech Yeah, maybe in future theyll release a full blown sequel with the original on disc :)
retrogametech You should send a pic of this to the Bloodragon developers and say Hey, I bought the game, but the box was empty! :D
retrogametech Great effort. Great idea and a great game.
retrogametech Now that would be awesome! haha
retrogametech I have yet to play this game :( Im a massive sega fan too :) you can buy this on pc at the shops. but I think your custom sega case looks so much better
retrogametech actually, thats still a Physical release
retrogametech The Pc version has a physical version here in Austria
retrogametech i like sega because if they say their gonna release periferals they do unlike nintendo.
retrogametech Pretty crazy for a 1990 console game! :)
retrogametech Sega was ahead of its time. If only they are still around, no doubt would bring out a beast of a console for todays market.
retrogametech Not much. Under 40? Cant remember off the top of my head. You can usually get them loose for around 2030.
retrogametech I find it a bit strange that they remove the rear ext port on later revisions of the hardware as they still could have used it with other peripherals thou personally have no idea what. Just that this was basicly way to ahead of its time I suppose   nobody really wanted to play a game with someone in separate houses in those days.
retrogametech Really informative video martin. Im a big fan of the mega drive too. As a kid it was one of my favourite consoles.
retrogametech This is so awsome! Cant wait too get one of these. Your Genesis megadrive is fucking solid bro..makes this old man smile! Peace and happy gameing
retrogametech Do you have any consoles you are waiting to selltrade because i just got an old channel F and i have no idea what to do with it
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech ok so i get the collecting part. i do. i really really do. so collect them. but why dont people play the games on emulators more? it works so well now.. and its so simple...
retrogametech Got the MVS running in attract mode and can stop looking at itdrooling :P
retrogametech This channel is awesome as fuck.
retrogametech I have the Nintendo consoles hidden away in storage. The Wii can play my GameCube games and emulates everything else so thats good enough for me :). The typical Nintendo games like Zelda and Mario never appealed much to me as a kid and werent very popular in my part of the world. So I dont have any nostalgia for Nintendo. I grew up playing stuff like Streets of Rage, Golden Axe, After Burner, Road Rash and Sonic :) . Love my Sega and Arcade stuff :)
retrogametech Do you have the model number?
retrogametech Hey Martin  I originally went for sony trinitron 15inch but found the screen a bit too small, then i went for BO 21inch it makes a huge difference, the scan lines are absolutely beautiful and much more defined due to the extra size, mainly use it with RGB connection for (snesmegadrive) but even the later consoles such as the PS2 also look really good,
retrogametech Charity shop called DebRA.
retrogametech Do you get the same full SCART effect with the scart adapters that go on composite cables which were common in UK and here in Ireland?
retrogametech If you find your TVs model number type it into google with the words service menu. You should find what you need. All Trinitrons have a hidden service menu :)
retrogametech Well its good you are happy.I cant imagine paying for such a device, especially considering I could just hook up my PC to a TV and use an emulator with filters that look way better than the unfiltered raw picture you showed. (the one without scanlines)
retrogametech Thanks :) . A quality Sony PVM looks like the optimum solution for getting the most out of these old systems :) . Imagine a wall of stacked PVMs! One for each console :P
retrogametech That is a nice device. You cant beat scanlines. :)
retrogametech RGB makes a really big difference IMO. Its so nice to be able to clearly see each individual pixel in a sprite. And the added colour vibrancy is stunning :) . Haha, I shot, edited and uploaded this vid twice before I was happy with it. It was really tricky to accurately capture and give a sense of what is seen with the naked eye. Its good to hear people like what they see. Cheers, Luke!
retrogametech Retrogametech, just bought a dreamcast and loving every minute. It makes a fair noise when reading discs. I assume that if I opened it up and greased its cogs and lazer running track it might help, but what grease would you advise?
retrogametech Thanks for the video, didnt know there was a product like this will definitely be updating my Mame cabinet with this.
retrogametech Very cool! I would definitely pick one of these up, if I didnt still use CRT televisions for gaming. This would also be great for a MAME cabinet utilizing an LCD monitor.
retrogametech Yea if you have the space.. then a bulky crt is the more sensible road.. u could probably get a nice crt for cheaper than the actual SLG3000 btw :p
retrogametech This video kinda kicked me into gear to improve the look of my retro consoles on my flat panel! Ive got an RGBVGA upscaler, and am working on getting a scanline generator. All that remains is for me to figure out how to get RGB out of my NTSC consoles. I see a lot of expensive RGB SCART cable importing in the coming weeks lol
retrogametech Id also like to know where you got the black QD case?
retrogametech RetroGameTech I know this is off topic and I hope Im not bugging you. I have a 32x that every time I put a genesis game in it it freezes. Im pretty sure its due to the fact the carts dont sit right in the 32x. They have a fair bit of play and can move real easy. Do you know how to fix this?
retrogametech Martin...that is beautiful :) How does the cart work in conjunction with the modem? More info please! Just fantastic too get to see this in action. Thank you and have a great weekend
retrogametech wow that megadrive is seriously hooked up. could you plug anything else into it?
retrogametech Madness???? This... is... SEGA!
retrogametech Ive never heard of this module before... do you plan on making a video about it. I would be curious to see what it really was in the day. Seems pretty inovative for the time.
retrogametech Yeah it was banned in america because it was a choking hazard.
retrogametech I beleive the saturn had a modem also. I dreamcast was the first to come standard with the console. I was looking to get one of those, is there anything usefull that it can do?
retrogametech Wow you found a practical use for the NGage. Can the modem be used on the Sega cdx?
retrogametech Reminds me of a track on Richard Burns Rally, very nice roads.
retrogametech Beautiful sights man! I just moved to New Hampshire from the west of Ireland, and I thought that in the rare occurrence ( ..cuz we normally get fuck all!) that it did snow there, that it was heavy, but its a different world in NH! pure snowed in! how much snow do you get typically in central Scotland?
retrogametech Funny... The last few days in winter where great!
retrogametech easy left, easy right, jump Sega Rally Championship:)
retrogametech Love the music. Compared to Rhode Island, Scotland looks like a cool place to live.
retrogametech Ugh... Your country has bad draw distance.
retrogametech Man Im so jealous of people who get snow. Looks like an amazing drive.
retrogametech How much snow do you guys typically get around this time of year?
retrogametech Can you make a video of fixing this problem?Both my 3ds have the same problem and I really need to learn how to fix.
retrogametech My son spilt milk on hes 3ds the A button doesnt any ideas I took it apart and cleaned the contacts but same result?? The button still feels stiffer than usual
retrogametech Ah so you Scottsmen have different notes to us Englishmen I assumed we all had the same notes because we all use GBP. Learn something new everyday :D
retrogametech Absolutely love the show, keep up the great work.
retrogametech well done for keeping it out of landfill
retrogametech Another great video man. Got me thinking though, I bought a Legend of Zelda 3DS a while back but it was missing the interior box (the cardboard tray everything sits in), any idea where on Earth Id find a replacement?
retrogametech I paid 43 for a 3ds and 20 for a display. I have fixed it and sold it for 104
retrogametech damn if the guy who sold this watched this, hed be pissed lol
retrogametech best part about ngage was that you could ran the games on any symbian phone without jailbreakingrootingwhatever your phone :)
retrogametech can somewone write down all of the games here in a comment so i can download them to my 6630? Yes, i still have one :D
retrogametech Thanks. Yeah it can be difficult explaining the logic (or lack there of!) behind owningcollecting sealed games :P Good luck with the Sonic collection. You should do a video on it!
retrogametech wow i didnt even know it had so many games
retrogametech Congrats Man! Ive Been Contemplating Starting A Complete Gamecube Collection.
retrogametech also would like to see gameplay for anyone honestly, especially ones that use a lot of 3d graphics as opposed to 2d.
retrogametech do some call of duty n gage gameplay
retrogametech Do you use an NGage as your actual phone?
retrogametech The price of the system seems to fluctuate quite a bit. between 1550 depending on modelcondition etc. The most expensive Ive seen a game sell for was a factory sealed copy of SEGA Rally. It went for 400 USD back in 2012. Crazy!
retrogametech Its xbox one joysticks
retrogametech Where did you find this I want to buy it
retrogametech Really bad idea IMO. Also, good luck maneuvering that molten plastic biro down the deep and very narrow holes in your expensive LE controller :P. Much easiersafer just to by the correct tool for a . Failing that just use the technique I mentioned using a precision screwdriver. The melted biro method only really works for game carts where the screw is easily accessible. And even then its likely going to damage your cart. Not to mention the fumes and dangers of handling hot molten plastic!
retrogametech i found someone on ebay selling them ebay.co.ukitmXbox360TransformingDPadREDCHROME261176934168?ptUKControllersAttachmentshashitem3ccf5bbf18
retrogametech It might just need reseated. But it could also mean the stick mechanism underneath has worn out. Its kinda difficult to say without taking a look. Controllers can be a real pain in the balls sometimes. The slightest bit of wear in any one of the buttons can throw the whole feel of the pad off. Sometimes its best just to replace the whole thing and save yourself the headache :P
retrogametech Also I think they left the battery pack black because it hides the stickers and other junk hiding under it.
retrogametech I mentioned some of the differences in the video description and I think theres an online wiki about it on the fan site :) . And yes, Kasumi is full frontal neked in the Japanese LE intro :P . Well, shes in some sort of water bubble thing but you can see everything ahem.
retrogametech cant find this game :(
retrogametech Its one of those game like Streets Of Rage where I never seem to get tired of playing it. Weirdly satisfying :)
retrogametech Youre missing out! :P
retrogametech i want to play my dreamcast now!
retrogametech They did a great job on the graphics with this series. DoA3 on oriinal Xbox looks like it could actually be a 360 title. The best part is the gameplay didnt suffer because of the pretty visuals.
retrogametech Thanks for watching :) . I think this one and the 3DS versions are the best. Ive not played the 5th one much yet but from what Ive seen its brilliant, too.
retrogametech Hes a pretty cheap boss. It definitely gets frustrating when he spams the same unblockable move at you :P Thanks for watching!
retrogametech Nice video. What are the chances of you doing some sort of urban exploration videos?
retrogametech Love your dash cams man, really cool, always good soundtrack too!
retrogametech Excellent, the road layout actually reminded me a little of Sweden, where I live. Especially earlier in the clip, in the city. Really good choice with the lowkey electro music, fit perfectly, Bravo.
retrogametech Thanks. Id like to but I dont think theres anything too interesting around my area. If I find something cool to explore Ill definitely do a vid though :)
retrogametech Power Glove are most definitely worthy of a listen! :) Ive been looking for a good excuse to use one of their tunes in a vid for ages :P. I freakin love the synth sound and electronic drum fills they use! xD Good luck with the theory! Its extremely easy so dont sweat it. Driving is great fun, just wish it wasnt so damn expensive :(
retrogametech Ahaha, I was wondering why I felt like I was watching an 80sRocky montage.
retrogametech you can backlit a gameboy advance using a kit from china, heres a video proof: watch?vXiu2sXSyBBc
retrogametech thanks for the reply i just rewatched the vid does the screen look faded like it does in the vid or in person is ther more contrast? and what would you say is the best color back lit screen? are other colors better suited? thanks
retrogametech does it effect the battery life very much?
retrogametech Awesome mod man! Kinda sad when I heard that you cannot do a backlight mod on the NeoGeo Pocket Color, guess I will have to go back to using a flashlight D:
retrogametech Nice page! and videos! If your ever looking for hard to find games or anything let us know! We carry a lot of the classics!
retrogametech Oh I see. I got mine from some slightly dodgy website that sold them preinstalled. Either way, it made the original GBA actually playable instead of a dark piece of crap :)
retrogametech Hi, nice vid! I want to make this mod, but have one doubt. The original screen is super when playing outside, even better with direct sunlight, will I lose this funktion if I switch to backlight screen? (I hade many DS and PSP consoles and they are unplayeble in direct sunlight...)
retrogametech damn , your videos are some of the most interesting on youtube
retrogametech Ive read about it but I think its really only for people who want to use the DMG for music production.
retrogametech So we can use the same method for Game  Watchs?
retrogametech Shhhhh..... secretly Im destroying every Nintendo console I can find.... I make vids about faulty GameBoys every now and then just so nobody suspects what Im really upto! SEGA FTW!! Shhhhhh.....
retrogametech I think I have a couple sitting in storage waiting to be refurbished. They arent that common but theyre also not rare.
retrogametech great mod, interesting idea to use the back light from a broken DS.... wonder if that same back light would work on a GameGear.....I need to look into that. How is the battery light? as even without this mod, the lifespan of VMU batteries are not long.
retrogametech Good work, Martin. Of course the second time around is better you have gained so much more experience in modding. Hows this for a challenge: I would like to see you apply a back light to an original Game Boy just for fun. :)
retrogametech Very cool! I miss my main green VMU I had back in the good ol days! :) DOA all the way!!
retrogametech sadly you cannot backlight a gameboy color, as the lcd isnt transparent anymore. for gbc only frontlighting works.
retrogametech That DoA2 Training Mode memories. 3
retrogametech Bro i think its a great deal, i have read that in the UK they maked a Turbografx on very limited quantities and i believe this is one of them, so if im correct you have a rare Turbografx, i live in Santiago, Chile and i owned one as a kid, and the stickers were different, mine said the whole Turbografx 16 with red and yellow letters, i hope you can do some research and answer my commentary, greetings!
retrogametech its turbografx after all. no wonder that it was in a good condition. good job anyways.
retrogametech great deal, great work on it  just amazing :) thumb up
retrogametech I was pretty surprised to win it at that price! :) After a little research it seems like a previous owner had attempted to do an RGB andor region mod. Possibly decided they were out of their depth but by that time had already killed the console. I just reconnected a couple of legs on that IC and it was good as new :) . A lucky find for sure!
retrogametech Says no one else bid on it, says 4 bids.
retrogametech can i steal all your consoles please 00
retrogametech After seeing the condition of the board I just assumed the thing must have been fried or previously repaired and had died again. I wasnt hopeful so it was a real surprise to see it boot up! :) I figured since the controller and game typically sell for around 10 each that I couldnt really lose :P. Problem is Ive now got a taste for TG16 gaming and would love to get the Japanese console with some games! But my wallet hasnt recovered from Xmas yet! :P
retrogametech Aww how do you reflow and stuff thats why I was watching I wanted to get into this sort of stuff I like fixing thing not sure if my hands will do it lol I guess I just would need to practice how did you find out that the pins where bad can you do a video of this stuff pleas ill Su. And keep a eye out
retrogametech 15 sorry I am full of useless facts Nice buy
retrogametech Autocorrection however is not much fun especially when the font size is very small :(
retrogametech Yet another great video, I would be happy to watch hour long vids of your collection as well as repair vids. Keep up the fantastic work....
retrogametech I would like to see the current gen stuff you picked up! :)
retrogametech Mario is so much fun! On the first shareware I like the taxi level!
retrogametech Not sure if anyone has mentioned this yet, but the PAL Dead or Alive case is actually an old case they used for rental games at Choices. I picked up Sega Rally 2 in the same kind of case.
retrogametech Some nice stuff there mate, Im after BK3 too. There seems to be SO many bootleg carts around for the GBA, i have a multi game cart but it wont run on my DS Lite. Metal Slug is awesome, shame its a dirty booty. Did you ever get that dodgy, fake MD with all them random switches running?
retrogametech for some reason I LOLd when you said the headphones smelled a bit suspicious.
retrogametech great video always excited to see a vid pop up from you ... usually hoping to learn how to fix another console. Thanks for the VID and keep them comeing
retrogametech Ah man trip world! I love that game :3
retrogametech Hey, could you upload the ROM for that bootleg Sonic for the Game Boy?
retrogametech The largest capacity flash ROM I could find in a PLCC32 package was 8Mbit. The Shantae ROM is 4Mbyte so I believe I would require at least a 32Mbit chip to accomodate the whole game. I will probably have to look into different chip types and alternative methods of flashing if I want to make a repro of that game. Im trying to figure out and learn a lot of this stuff out as I go :P
retrogametech Hi there Ive been watching your videos for a littlw while now(about 45 months since I first discovered your channel) Just thought Id say great videos and projects. It makes me want to start more hardware based projects, no idea where Id start but I thought it be cool to mention youre a source of inspiration for me in a sense! Keep up the great vids and projects!
retrogametech I was just wondering if youre still working on this Reproduction cart project. Because if you still are, I may have something that will make them look a little less messy and almost official.
retrogametech Hey Thomas! Good to hear from you! Programmer is very cool. I think itll come in handy for future projects :) . Surprisingly cheap too!
retrogametech I accidentally sent that comment before finishing it. On the subject of flash carts, do you still have any of those r4 cards? Both of mine have packed in and theyre getting pretty hard to come by.
retrogametech AMAZING VIDEO! make sure to keep us updated with the information and the project. I enjoyed it greatly and now i need to do it
retrogametech it is at first Ive let my friends play around with mine they get so confused but when you learn how to use it it feels so good :)
retrogametech Also, Im sure you know this already, but check the legs coming off the chips in that Conker game. One could be floating a tiny bit off the contact and itll screw up the whole game.
retrogametech HOW IN THE MOTHER FUCK DO YOU DETATCH THE RIBBON CABLE!???
retrogametech Thats a Game Boy Color game... do those work in the original Game Boy?!?!? I had no idea!
retrogametech Lol I have the same triwing screwdriver as u
retrogametech i like all your videos.
retrogametech Hope the previous owner is watching..
retrogametech How did you take off and reattach the screen lens?
retrogametech this is a cool channel subscribes
retrogametech dude your videos kick ass! dont stop, I always look forward to them
retrogametech for sure, Martin is a very generous guy. thanks a lot and I think you should give it a shot!
retrogametech Wed just end up deepfrying a taco lmao
retrogametech Haggis is honestly one of scotlands gems you should try it
retrogametech no video of you trying the stuff out?
retrogametech Does this mean that youll be doing another fooddrink review Luke?
retrogametech What a great gift, happy Christmas!
retrogametech Nice gift! Hello everyone, im subbing your channel as a xmas present, so if you want one more subscriber drop me pm saying: sub me. i will accept :) Happy Xmas time Luke and everyone here.
retrogametech Thats really nice!!That Irn Brus a great drink!!
retrogametech hahaha irn bru iron brew  made in scotland from girders  great when hungover and very cold! i remember seeing RetroGameTechs video with that santa GBA game in it looked fun n quirky platform type game, you should do a video on the irn bru lol
retrogametech Piss take, who at Nintendo thought this was a good idea?
retrogametech That sounds really stupid.
retrogametech I saw this on IGN yesterday. That is bull crap. I wont face it in the U.S., but this shouldnt happen anywhere.
retrogametech Theyre trying to avoid getting in trouble with the law in Germany due to the fact that Nintendo of Europe is headquartered there. Since thats where theyre based they have to follow German law and its really fuzzy on what is allowed for digital shops so Nintendo is erring on the side of caution and following the television rules for the eShop. Sony and Microsoft get around this due to the fact their European operations are not based in Germany and have different laws they have to follow.
retrogametech Erm.... England people?
retrogametech And yet another reason I will not buy another Nintendo console. I almost got a 3DS a week ago sooooo glad I didnt.
retrogametech fuck new gen i sold my ps3 a year ago and i dont regret it , retro all the way!
retrogametech Its part of the child rating laws in Germany and that is the Nintendo distribution hub of Europe.
retrogametech Im of the opinion that parents should actually do some parenting and be responsible for controlling what there children watch, download or listen to. Not that I would use the store on the 3DS, it seems very over priced compared to owning a physical copy of games they have for sale.
retrogametech I LOVE DRILL DOZER! Seriously, I wish I kept my GBA when I was a kid. If I would have known this game existed when I was a kid I would have bought five of them. The good old days served me well. I even could have played it on my ds, but still, luck was not on my side. I found it on an emulator and instantly fell in love with it. You are one sniper you clever dog! Have fun with the bonus levels, boy they are a bitch!
retrogametech Its very good! One of the best on the system IMHO :)
retrogametech I wanted to see the GBA Santa game for comparison. :(
retrogametech allawys love a pick up vid even if its simpel :) come check out mine :p
retrogametech Honestly, I am continually surprised by what I find. There are so many games I didnt realise got a port for the system. Some very obscure but brilliant stuff!! I have a couple dozen more hidden gems in my collection that I bet most people dont know even exist! :P . One of the best game libraries ever IMHO :)
retrogametech Thanks, glad you liked it!
retrogametech RetroGameTech I will take a look, and by the way, you say you feel old Im 47 and still love playing..... Lol
retrogametech I remember it from my younger years, I first encountered it eight years ago when I had just turned six, I still have it and play it regularly.
retrogametech I think in Japan they used the EXT port for a modem, but the cable for Zero Tolerance is rare because i think it was a send away thing, so youd need to make a ghetto cable not sure if a regular serial cable would work it might.
retrogametech Cool vid man! These vids seem cool )
retrogametech Im so gonna do that headfone jack thing
retrogametech The rocker switches look a little bigger next to the sliders but theyre more or less the same depth. Im sure theyd fit in a model 2 no problem. Their pins are also easily bent should space be an issue. The way I see it, a console isnt a member of my family UNTIL its been modded! :P
retrogametech Yes, you are correct. But, in order for this to work you must also have the MCD powered up to get audio, even if only playing the MD. I play my MCD so infrequently that I prefer to keep it disconnected it from the PSU. Its more convenient for me (less wiresmess) to get my audio directly from the MD as this is what I mostly play. If I feel like playing MCD, I also have the correct mixer patch cable and phono adapters required should I need them. But yes, you are correct in your theory :).
retrogametech Where did you get the 10mhz oscillators? Ive been looking for them for what seems like forever.
retrogametech My PC isnt that great, could probably run a couple of them but at low quality settings and res. But I thought I may as well order the games, just keep them in my steam account until I upgrade the PC
retrogametech i like that you used the rocker switch over the metal toggle switches that you usually see on modded systems...ive always hated the way they look and never wanted to do any mods that required switches because of them....it seems so obvious to just use another type but it just never really dawned on me so now i might actually do some mods.
retrogametech Are there any mods or repairs you preferably enjoy do over others?
retrogametech Looks cool, cant wait to see the finish product!
retrogametech Lol, yeah just a few months :P. It still sits half complete in my cupboard, haha. Maybe it can be my new year resolution to finish it.
retrogametech Nice project! I am going to follow this. BTW, that BIOS, or atleast that matchbox came from Finland. :D
retrogametech mame, winkawaks, uh... used to be some old dos one but he never updated it.
retrogametech Its all coming together.
retrogametech Thats a pretty coll idea :)
retrogametech I want to do this, hopefully I can once I get my CNC and make it soo pretty. Awesome work man!
retrogametech was waiting for this one! Looking forward to see it completed Martin! It will be great as always!
retrogametech Hi there m8 I love your channel and videos. I have a problem with my Dreamcast, It starts up, shows the Dreamcast logo and the screen goes blank. some guys say its the fan that needs replacing. I need some help as you have dealt with many consoles m8. Thank You
retrogametech i did that when i took apart my laptop. only had 1 screw left and was for shielding. think might have put a wrong screw someplace maybe because the one was too small it seemed which is why didnt go.
retrogametech in his defense, it could have been used for like direct dialup (your dreamcast calls your friends dreamcast using yoru phone number) or dialing up an old special BBS system that didnt actually connect to the internet.
retrogametech thats ok until you knock them all to fook by accident
retrogametech Ok, Im confused... my NA model DC has an orange logo on it (pulled it out to verify,) or, is it more blatantly orange for the Japanese model, and more red for North America?
retrogametech Excellent video. Also good to notice a screwdriver with magnetic tip helps tons.
retrogametech Nothing If Foolproof. Happened With One Of My GBA SPs.
retrogametech How hard easy is it to mod the dreamcast to run at 60 hz full screen.
retrogametech LIKE A BOSS!!!! :D:D:D
retrogametech Some interesting pickups there, cool that the Mega Drive wireless controllers are backwards compatible with the Master System. By the way, have you noticed any buffering issues on Youtube over the past few weeks. At certain times of the day quality settings as low as 240p take an age to load. No problems on the iPlayer at same time so must be Youtube specific. If youve had problems google this Oyl8HEc4rHg, should bring you to a Slow buffering google productforum page. Maybe EU server issue?
retrogametech I actually kinda like it! lol :P . Thanks btw :)
retrogametech That poor Mega Drive, as if getting all the other ports filled wasnt degrading enough. I love Shadow Dancer! I hate that it was not released in US. I dont think I have ever seen a F1 car drift like that...but I would pay money to see someone do it. That Space Harrier music is...intersting?
retrogametech Agreed, Sega Ages has my favourite versions of Space Harrier, Afterburner II and Outrun, so much infact that I picked up the Japanese Saturn versions of Outrun and Afterburner II yesterday. They shouldve kept Outruns arrange soundtrack and Afterburners soundtrack with melodies in Sega Ages Vol.1
retrogametech Congrats on 10K subs and 3 million views! Your commitment to providing quality content is impeccable I dont think many people would burn themselves while making a video, and still worry about having the right angle. :)
retrogametech Wow I had no idea they remade space Harrior. But Im from the US so I probably wont be able to play this. XD
retrogametech I got a good deal on my sega genesis wireless controllers, too. I got one controller and the reciever in a lot of 20 Broken genesis controllers for about 20 shipped. I tried them and all of the controllers worked except two third party controllers.
retrogametech Great Sunday video ..Enjoyed this. Have an awesome day.
retrogametech you have the same holder as me, mine broke off there too .
retrogametech Very helpful. Thanks man!
retrogametech Be sure that the game is in your region, 3ds is region locked
retrogametech Nintendo should put on the advert ITS NOT A CUP!!!
retrogametech Every solder based repair requires a beep button... doesnt matter how careful you are, I recommend getting drunk beforehand and caring less... however that time I not only grabbed the tip and dropped it on my leg, disproves my advice.
retrogametech i dont think that they work really well with surface mounted stuff.
retrogametech Thanks for showing the actual repair! Great job there! Keep em comming....
retrogametech Think after watching this I will be wearing gloves when soldering lol! If you do sell it, I would probably sell it on eBay as these are still going for 100 quite easily, especially boxed. Trade in value isnt so great in your case as the 3DS xl sells for 170 in stores, whereas Amazon are still selling it for 158 with a free game.
retrogametech Thanks. Im never sure if people will like these type of vids or not, haha. But I enjoy watching other people do repairsmods too. You can sometimes pickup tricks you hadnt though of etc. Thanks for watching!
retrogametech Great video bristolian? ?
retrogametech Your poor Wii is crushed by those huge consoles and TV, lol. XD
retrogametech do you still have the Orange Pikachu N64? Id so would you consider selling it? since im after one :3
retrogametech If its so simple to make a console region free, why dont the producers just so it themselves?
retrogametech I used to think martin and you were the same person....It was a long time ago but it is the truth. I didnt used to use youtube with a profile and subscrptions. You are both sincere and talented...
retrogametech god damn Im so jealous! nice systems man! 1010
retrogametech Argos a couple of years ago. Think it was about 25.
retrogametech Well, playing nicely into that stereotypical tech geek persona, there is no girlfriend or wife for me to worry about right now, haha. I suppose any future lady friends will either have to be very tolerant or just as geeky as me! :P
retrogametech i cant believe i never saw you responded. HOLY CRAP YOU RESPONDED!!! please make the video on your handhelds. that would be sooooo awesome. bro you are so cool! i watch all your videos. even if i dont like the content, its always a good time listening to your accent haha.
retrogametech Got my CMVS project on the way P
retrogametech Awesome xD You listen to the best swiss Band 0 And I really love your gaming setup Q
retrogametech Nicely organized setup! I wish mine could be this tidy. Id expect you to be the type of guy to ask, Does this system come in black? Ill take any color... as long as its black.
retrogametech I sold off about 23rds of my PS3 collection. I just never played it and I really dont like that controller. I just buy current gen stuff for the 360. The PS3 is mostly used as a BluRay, DVD and PS1 these days.
retrogametech Yeah that gets confusing sometimes! Me  What the hell?, the TV remote stopped working?, WTF? confused look on face. Me a couple of seconds later  Doh! :P
retrogametech Hey Martin,i need some help with one of my clone R4 flash carts,i have sent you a pm about it.Thanks
retrogametech Theyre really useful. Frowned upon by many but most of my game purchases have been based on games I downloaded on one of these things! They were also the main reason I picked up a DS in the first place :)
retrogametech Im looking to buy an r4 card. Can you help me? I dont know which website to use becuase everyone I ask says a different thing...I live in USA so I would like one that does free shipping in USA. Bc a few other sites do free ship but they are in china and other foreign places. If you can respond, that would be great :) Thank you.!
retrogametech That is ALLOT of R4 cards
retrogametech I Got one for 30 bucks in turkey, sold as a Nintendo Super 300 PACK. works dandy.
retrogametech thats not possible i even ordered a couple from different places one is official they all had the same bump only acekard etc dont ive never seen an (well at least more current r4s even the 3ds) they all have bumps only the really old cards dont
retrogametech So in the end how many did you get to work again?
retrogametech The ones with bumps are not official, theyre the fakeclone R4 cards. The market was totally flooded with them and even legitimate resellers ended up selling them. In this joblot I got many of those fake R4 clones with the bumps and many of the official ones without. In comparison the fake ones have much poorer build quality and dont work with the proper R4 firmware.
retrogametech Theyre illegal to sell at all in the UK, and I think in Germany? Although Im not too sure about that.
retrogametech I have a boxed copy of this game for sale if anyone is interested?
retrogametech de ja fucking vu. i picked this up in china but it had its own cart
retrogametech That music is horrific, it shouldnt even be legal to put that music on that bootleg game lol...
retrogametech its on the saturn not the mega drive
retrogametech These console homebrew hack like games really usually put in music as an after thought. I would like to play one someday with decent music. haha
retrogametech Have you never heard any chiptune or what can be produced using a GameBoy and LSDJ? You should YouTube it! )
retrogametech Have you ever considered using a capture card and recording from a Game Boy Player or Super Game Boy?
retrogametech oh my god the sonic  knuckles title theme just got murdered lol
retrogametech My poor sennheisers D:
retrogametech Is it pokemon music in the background? It sounds like it from ruby sapphire or emerald.
retrogametech My DS Lite recently stopped holding a charge and I read online it could be one of the fuses, but in their example, it had fallen completely off and a quick check told me they havent fallen off on my DSL. How would I diagnose if, and which fuse is the problem?
retrogametech Thank you Martin let me know when u do also would you mod my snes and mega drive to play all regions and 60hz please
retrogametech What mod card do u have in ur ds?
retrogametech Aww man, that sucks! Hope it heals quick!
retrogametech i was just asking where i could find a gameboy advance sp i have been looking everywhere
retrogametech Yes they do, he lives just one city over and although they are rare, we do have them.
retrogametech Hi i was just wondering is there any way to repair the hinges of a Nintendo ds light as they are a bit loses and i dont want it too break. Thank you
retrogametech Yeah you make a lot and it seems like everyone enjoys them so keep it up!
retrogametech Wow! thats amazing! (first but i dont really care)
retrogametech Any chance you could make a tutorial on how to make one of these?
retrogametech Wow, thanks RGT for uploading this! I remember when a buddy of mine borrowed my Genny 32X CD setup, and had hooked the wrong powersupply to my then 400 model1 SEGA CD, and killed it. I died that day. I am soon going to build a Genesis 32X CD minicab, and using only one adaptor will help heaps. I just uploaded a Dreamcast arcade cabinets video you might really like. Its a new upload, so Im sure its pretty low on the Dreamcast searches, so the link is watch?vsBCYo9Kn1B0 Thanks again man.
retrogametech Thanks for the mention. I 1st designed my version of this power supply more than a year ago when one of my customers asked if I could create one for him. I set to work running current draw tests on all 3 units combined. I then started quality testing and endurance testing. Today the Trio is a best seller at Retro Game Cave.
retrogametech The voltages and current running though the wires is very low. Theyre all soldered together and properly insulated so the chance of fire is extremely low. The cigarette adapter has been completely gutted. Its really just a plastic housing to keep the wires from getting tangled or damaged and isnt part of the circuit. The PSU itself is fused as is the power strip itll be connected to. So any major short circuit or component failure would burn out the fuse before anything else.
retrogametech You should produce these things and sell them on ebay or somerhing.
retrogametech Is that a ps1 power cable in the middle?
retrogametech would you consider making these and selling them?
retrogametech RetroGameTech I sent you a PM with a really cool Xbox mod that you should check out. I think itd be a great video for you to do.
retrogametech I like your thinking on wiring everything up to a jamma harness. Im doing the same so can switch between my arcade and consolised
retrogametech Im pretty sure Luke Morse did an in depth tutorial on fixing N64 controllers just recently. If you go to his channel Im sure youll find it no problem :)
retrogametech this is what i like to see, YouTubers helping one another instead of arguing about religion
retrogametech Multi Video System... wait that was a joke right? .
retrogametech Awesome mvs dude, I have consolized mv1b aswell. I dont have an enclosure for it yet but Im excited to see what you come up with to enclose the mvs board. Maybe you could do a step by step on how you made the housing for it?
retrogametech Thank god for the biosmasta. :)
retrogametech If you are looking for arcade controls, I used a reseller of Ultimarc. Ultimarc have really good quality products at a reasonable price.
retrogametech Where did you get this? i want one
retrogametech Dude please answer ) When are you repairing a console again? I love those vids ) Prob gave the xbox one like 100 views )
retrogametech haha mario gunna say bitch where is your blast proccesor now byatch! but as fer the music ..its not bad .. better den some other game ....holy crap it in my head.......
retrogametech lol one time i had to go to a certain country and my brother saw a sonic game called sonic advance six at their mall
retrogametech There was no Sonic fighting game on the Saturn.If your on about Sonic The Fighters that came out only on the Sega Model 2 arcade board and on Sonic gems collection on the PS2 and GameCube.
retrogametech whats a gamebox at 7:45?
retrogametech Take a dump :D liking the colour of your DS lite!!
retrogametech Sweet!! Thanks for the share! Well made video cant say that about the game!!! Hahaaaaha, happy gaming! Peace
retrogametech What on EARTH are you talking about youll start seeing more and more of these being sold as faulty. If youre handy with a soldering iron then you can potentially grab yourself a real bargain! I bought one off Ebay and the damn things peripherals werent sending any output. Headset 1  2  USB decoder work, Possibly the HiFi port are all in working order. However, the main reason I loved this unit was for the 5.1 Analog Output peripherals... but those do not work. Is it a fuse? a diodeResistor, a Capacitor?? could this all be at the Main Intergrated circuts fault? Fourtunatly i have 2 of these exsactly showing the same problem Just i do not know what direction to begin repairing this unit in. .PS: Also, i do not feel like starting the project if the problem persists in a simple manor whereas i always end up doing things the hard way when it comes to the simple repairs.Confident I may be in repairing The Tritton AX PRO 2011 Model honestly either rout this undergoes, BUT the question lies with what do i repair? Because i too would like to have a good bargain out of both my AX PROs.hEX mCcAUSLIN
retrogametech I Pleasure Myself To Comments Like Yours.
retrogametech Why the fuck would you type like that?
retrogametech Driver San Francisco haha :)
retrogametech Couldnt find any on eBay. Nice fix
retrogametech I cant believe you gave up on the other board) If it was me, I would sell both faulty boards and find one that works, but that is because I am getting lazy in my old age.
retrogametech NEW CONSOLIZED PROJECT CHECK YOUR MESSAGERS search Sega STV Titan Arcade Jamma Mother Board on ebay
retrogametech You mentioned before that the cartridge you are using is one of the MultiInOne carts. Perhaps if you tried a legitimate cartridge for testing, you may get a better result?
retrogametech A lot of the solder points around the chips are pretty dull so possibly a bad connection?
retrogametech I tried swapping out the BIOS chips but got the same garbled menu. Could it possibly be a GPU or RAM issue? I suppose I just need to go over the whole board again and clean up the individual legs on all the chips and resolder. At least theres some signs of life with this one! Nearly hit the roof when I heard the Neo Geo intro music and got the title screen that one time, lol.
retrogametech I never knew that. Good stuff man.
retrogametech watch?vluZWkteXhVEfeatureplcp HEres a video of a NES cart I installed a battery holder on.
retrogametech The that I find cool about this, is the battery holder. Of course this is cheaper but that is not the most impressive part to me. It is more that I cannot stand soldered batteries, what with the reluctance to pull it out if worried about leakage of an old cell. Anybody else feel that way? It isnt just a practicality thing (although it is partly that). It is also a factor that may deter people from replacing the battery (if unsure about novice soldering), thereby increasing the chance of a leak.
retrogametech make a video of the soldering. i wanna see your equipment. soldering, that is.
retrogametech Did they use flash memory to store saves instead? What did the Pokemon games use?
retrogametech I wish I was at all handy.
retrogametech Just Curious, Do You Know If Its At All Possible With GBA And Gameboy Games Without Modding The Plastic?
retrogametech haha pretty neat! its sad that the batteries in most games will be dyingdead
retrogametech They do! Check out this video with a tutorial on how to put them inside Pokmon Gold (same shape as Red): watch?vCKU6hDHgnNQ
retrogametech why cant I watch this damn video?
retrogametech metallica in the background! :D
retrogametech Have you removed the clock capacitor on your Xbox?
retrogametech Haha, I was weirdly disappointed I didnt need to tinker with it! Still, really happy with it :)
retrogametech heh, my Xbox has a stuck DVDROM drive.....hit the open button and then smack the top of the system and the drive opens LOL
retrogametech Protect switch was to disable the mod chip if you were playing Xbox Live
retrogametech you dont need a chip to mod the console, i use splinter cell and action replay to mod mine, you put the mod on action replay from your pc, and then your run the mod from within the game using action replay.
retrogametech i have a halo edition that i got as interest from someone
retrogametech Just bought a Old Megadrive 1 for exactly that Chip, will have to post Videos of the finished product
retrogametech My bad  skipped around and missed your point about the BIOS :P
retrogametech How do you deep clean a motherboard like that?
retrogametech hell yes I want to get a MVS too and will prob get a cheap one with faults to fix up so this will be very helpful ty :)
retrogametech Have you got an AES? I find the AES much more appealing, maybe because the cartridges have labels :o)
retrogametech A 10 minute quick update? Still watched the whole thing though
retrogametech thats to small how can u play that dude
retrogametech I dont do much with the 360 these days sorry. I should have an original Xbox project soon though :)
retrogametech Epic find dude, hows that AES coming on?
retrogametech Awwww that is sooooo adorable!!!!! Maybe they bring good luck!
retrogametech do they have these for systems like the NES and SNES?
retrogametech you should make a video about it :)
retrogametech Does any one know any good ways to store xbox360 and ps3 games Does any one know any good shops in the UK to purchase a video game shelf like the one in this video?
retrogametech Admit it : you play these and pretend youre a giant......
retrogametech i wonder how the blast processing handles !
retrogametech I guess youll be the guy to speak to if I need any spare parts then, lol. Yeah, those vias are what worry me. I dont want to have to start running wires from one side of the board to the other! Any suggestions on the best place to pickup a UniBios chip from?
retrogametech Nice to see that you have made a little bit of progress. I dont know why it is that I find arcade repair so interesting. Where did you pick up the multicart?
retrogametech What are you going to house the console in?
retrogametech It sounds like there is still a glimmer of interest in these boards for you, seeing how, despite your hardware being in the loft, that you are watching this video. I for one am finding it rewarding just reading both positive and negative comments on the boards.
retrogametech Do you have to be a certain distance from the TV for it to work? I need to sit close as I cant see well!
retrogametech I got some official Sega master system 3d glasses for 30 boxed and complete with polystyrene inserts, manual, mint condition glasses (no cracks), 3d adaptor and the lead!
retrogametech lol yeah i know, i just thought that phrase was really funny :P
retrogametech those came with the x3d extreme 3d system for pc. i got it free but never really tried them.
retrogametech You could sit on the floor directly in front of your TV and still see the 3D effect. I was walking around the room while playing and the 3D effect looked great! So distance isnt really a problem.
retrogametech Google Logisys CLK4WT2 4 Dual White Cold Cathode Kit those would of fit perfectly for what you needed. etherway keep up the great work.
retrogametech I was considering do this. It wouldnt be too difficult to convert the countdown display to a real clock. Maybe a future project if I find a cheap donor clock :)
retrogametech Yes, but can you fix the NGauge from sucking 100 though? That is the question lol. Good stuff man.
retrogametech Theoretically, If I had an unlimited amount of money how much would you sell every game, console and awesome tech gadget you owned for?
retrogametech I cannot help but look at this giant NGage thing and wonder how it might look if modded to accommodate that NeoGeo arcade board (with a screen added of course).
retrogametech Im definitely picking one of these up, along with a Gameboy Micro :)
retrogametech Did you transfer the roms to your memory card with the EZFlash software using a PC? The ROMS need to be patched and the EZClient software also has to create a special folder with save files etc.
retrogametech from where did you buy it ? I wanted a trusted website...
retrogametech managed to add some cheats to the games? if not, check out gbaatm.
retrogametech where can i get a gamebox
retrogametech why dont you mod your agb to backlight?? good vid
retrogametech I was aware of SFII, but just thought all these flash cards had these sort of issues. Will the EZ Flash play Monkey Ball Jr? I have never seen that game emulated correctly. Also, will the GB USB smart card work in a Micro? Really, the only reason I bought a Supercard was because I had a dinky little Micro,  I wanted everything all in one small portable handheld  no extra carts. I always wanted the Micro to be backwards compatible with the GBGBC anyway, smooth NES emulation was just a bonus.
GameSack The Gaming Historian FTW!!!
GameSack wish i could go. you and alphaomegasin make it worth it
GameSack Good luck to all of you.
GameSack The Game Chasers got no love from game sack hahaha. like the Highlander, there can be only one...Duo on Youtube!
GameSack Wish i could attend i wouldnt mind meeting you two.
GameSack Ill be there! I cannot WAIT to meet you guys!! Ok ok ok, calm down, Josh... stop geeking out... lol
GameSack live in Texas but wont be able to go to Arlington :(
GameSack Why update a dead game when halo 3 has more players than halo 4.Get back Halo 3 Double XP Weekend and the ORIGINAL GAMETYPES.
GameSack As I stated on their Facebook page a couple weeks ago, this is the only Youtube subscription I anticipate new videos on. For some reason I cant find my comment on their page anymore though....
GameSack Neo Geo CD reminds me of a North American SEGA Saturn and the games and cases remind me of Japanese SEGA Saturn games. Both systems are obviously 2D juggernauts.
GameSack Please do a episode on the Commodore 64. Such a great system!
GameSack Cool, lots of info on a system I knew very little about aside from the Neo Geo connection and the loading times (and Im not surprised to learn that theyre exaggerated).
GameSack They are a lot of neo geo AESMVS games that did not get a release on CD)Any way to take neo geo AESAES rom and burn it to a cd so you could play them on neo geo cd?
GameSack So of all the comedy skits at the end of all the episodes... this one so far is definately my favourite!!!!!
GameSack Is that a real Turf masters? If so that is quite amazing!
GameSack Greetings from Boulder. Your stopmotion hardware teardowns are the best.
GameSack Where did you get the shirt Dave?
GameSack Are there any Fighting Games on the Neo Geo CD?
GameSack Great show guys! You should do a sketchonly special you guys are hilarious!
GameSack Come on dudes, Viewpoint is SO cool!
GameSack You guys are great yall need to do more episodes.
GameSack This game is completely messed up! I would hate to be that guy (getting hit in the balls)
GameSack Is the Game Sack a ScotteVest bag?
GameSack Talk about mother on the famicom!!!
GameSack adventures of little Ralph, for PSX
GameSack guys you should make an entire episode dedicated to MSX! that if you have one of course :)
GameSack Keep doing what you do guys. I love your videos and are easily the best gaming gurus on youtube.
GameSack Try the soccer RPG game Captain Tsubasa on Famicom  super famicom. I love the game. Try part 2 or 3.
GameSack Legend of Xanadu II looks awesome. Too bad it was never localized for NA.
GameSack You could probably do an entire episode on The Great Battle series released on the Famicom,SFC,Gameboy,PS1,NDS  PSP. There are also a ton of spinoff titles too, and theyre all pretty sweet!
GameSack You guys should check out a Japanonly PSX game called Community Pom. I think itd be right up your alley.
GameSack What I dont understand is how bungie feels that it understands the playstation community, and I dont think the Playstation community understands them either. The vast majority of Bungies fans are based on the xbox, and the remainder of them on PC, owning to Halo and bungies previous titles like myth. Theyve never made a game for them, and also the majority of playstation users will never have played Halo. So hundreds of thousands of Playstation players have preordered the game based solely on the fact that it was praised by critics at E3, and also that the development studio has made very popular games (Halo) in the past, that (vitally) they themselves actually havent had the opportunity to play. Who knows what they might be expecting, especially with all the hype? Most of them arent preordering the game because of their own experience with Bungies games, and that will cause some of the players to be dissapointed. All im saying is that a lot of them dont really know what to expect (gameplay wise) from Destiny, or from Bungie themselves. They might have all hyped themselves up for a game that just isnt their bag of chips, and that would be a shame for the reviews and the reputation of Bungie.I didnt mean this comment to be hateful in any way, and am just concerned about how quickly the community size on that platform may decline. Id like to hear anyone elses opinions on this.
GameSack 2 quits in one video coop YOUR officially ICY
GameSack SAINTS MIGHT POSSIBLY SIGN BACK GREER AND VILMA AND MAYBE EVEN WILL SMITH!
GameSack http:www.twitch.tvthatdcoop
GameSack I was told Id go blind if I did that too much, but losing my RAM is a new one.
GameSack awww no game sack you got me once with this its not happening agian
GameSack So sony screws Nintendo again huh? Lol ironic since the 64 was watching and I see Phillips was nowhere to be seen haha  lol props to anyone that knows what Im talking about
GameSack Shot in 5K resolution as always
GameSack Looool.That is awkward. You ruined the consoles image :p
GameSack What the hell? What I just see?! Still, pretty funny :)
GameSack That was fuckin hilarious. I consider this the cowbell of videos. And we need more. More cowbell.
GameSack i thought the snes played hard to get, then turned down the playstation?
GameSack NO Original Medal of Honor!? Fail! )
GameSack Crash 3 Warped is definitely the best game in the series.
GameSack this was a pleasure to watch thanksbut i was hoping to see jet moto or twisted metal on here im sure you guys played both those games and you guys probably spit balled including one of them
GameSack You should cover games and series like Jet Moto, Resident Evil, Road Rash, Tekken, Tomb Raider, Twisted Metal, Vigilante 8, Wipeout, and Um Jammer Lammy.
GameSack uhh.... no mention of resident evil, gran turismo (like... THE best racing game on the whole system)?
GameSack No mention of the Colony Wars or GPolice series?
GameSack CLASSIC GAME ROOM talked about GHOST IN THE SHELL a few years back.
GameSack I really hope to see more console focused videos from you guys. The others are definitely good but the main reason i got kind of obsessed with this channel is because of the Dreamcast and Saturn episodes.
GameSack I had a crush on the Japanese girl from Ridge Racer
GameSack ach dhalu pls aboniren
GameSack Ugh. Voice is so monotone and unexpressive, but great video anyway. You introduced me to a lot of mascots I missed out on!
GameSack buck bumble was the shit as a kid and so was vectorman. ive gone back to play the latter and still enjoyed it but i can see how they might not have stood the test of time.
GameSack Vectorman is AWESOME )I love the atmospere of the game, the gameplay, everything!I think that this mascot failed just because the 16 bit era came in the past. I live in Russia, everything was different here because we had everything much later, so these two games were extremelly popular here, and the Vectorman himself was very famous at the time
GameSack Vectorman and Billy Hatcher are side series, not mascots. People gotta do research before recording themselves play games.
GameSack vectorman was awesome
GameSack Dave, isnt Samba actually called Amigo?
GameSack Fuck your commercial.
GameSack What you mean by Shrek, its names actually Baron Dante.
GameSack lol...this dude is freaking hilarious. Well played. Shoulda told him we already had one testicularlyscrotum challenged Ranger (Zoma).
GameSack Catsle of Illusion  at the end.... well, every good cinema projector operator knows  that you turn off the projector AFTER the curtains are completly closed :)
GameSack Whats the song that plays between games?
GameSack 12:53 is that spiderman?
GameSack Shining Force II should be number one! I know that its niche, but its sadly overlooked!
GameSack For me its a tough call NOT choosing Super Castlevania 4 but I think Id go with Chrono Trigger. I played it at the right time (13) and the story, music and graphics just blew me away. Ive played through it 91 times (yes I keep count) and never get tired of it. I play it at least a few times a year because its just that good.
GameSack I do agree with number 1, but the side scrolling flyingshooter of sega i would have changed to UN Squadron
GameSack what game is that music from playing at 2:55?
GameSack correct me if im wrong but I believe Battletoads did the whole throw the enemy at the screen to beat the boss thing 1st.....not tmnt.
GameSack Oh I just noticed u played a chrono trigger song in the background at the end!!! What a cock tease
GameSack Ive just downloaded Shinobi 3 on the 3DS. That double jump is a bitch lol
GameSack Really had enjoyment with trutles too. It was a strong fighter.
GameSack Are you kidding me? Budokan 2 was the best of the DBZ series on SNES.
GameSack The being too far apart from each other thing in the DBZ game mimics the actual anime, which is infamous for multiple 20minute episodes of people staring down each other.
GameSack Play Dragon Ball Z Ultimate Boudakai, and or Boudakai tenkenachi 2. It will walk you through the storyline perfectly and teach you what is going on in that game. Both very fun fighting games.
GameSack Slaughter sport for the genesis. Do that one!
GameSack Having played DB Budokai 2 to the death back in the day when my cousin had it, I can tell you the game has dash key. L or R I think to dash left or right, you can make a homing fireball chase you and lead it back to the guy who shot it. I agree its not... really a good game at the time but I have to give it credit for having a beam clash system, not only superior to the cheat sword clash system that Samurai Shodown failed to implement correctly, but really makes the game like its source material. :3
GameSack What about Amiga fighters? Shadow Fighter, Elfmania, FIghtin Spirit? Each of these was in my opinion far better (gfxwise, at least) than the games covered here.
GameSack 12:33 Hmmm... Thats just like that stage from street fighter 4.
GameSack amazing compilation, someone had to do it
GameSack Happy birthday, Jon (a day late, I know)!
GameSack Could you do Jazz Jackrabbit (first for DOS, couldnt care less for JJ2) review, please?
GameSack 1 hardcore oldschool gamer channel on Youtube, nothing else even comes close.
GameSack Wow, nice looking games Ive never seen before good review guys.
GameSack Get the PCBs and a Supergun? You dont need to buy or setup a full cabinet...
GameSack Would love to play bucky o hare.
GameSack Some good games there I will check them out. Thank you.
GameSack At home on the Sega Dreamcast where they belong. Not the Sega Saturn
GameSack Sweet Game Sack shirt Joe!!! Where do we pick one up?
GameSack I played Battletoads, which was at one arcade I went to once in a while. From what Ive read, it wasnt in wide release. Dont recall seeing any of the others, but I didnt start going to arcades a lot until 1994.That slanted elevator level at 7:53 was also used in one of the Ninja Turtles games, either 3 or 4, dont remember which.
GameSack Without your mouse you cant point out soft beards :
GameSack I would love to participate in this 2v2 thing! It sounds like a ton of fun, and I really want to get better at the game too. That is a great idea.I havent gotten a chance to try out the new action sack stuffs yet, but paintball sounds really interesting.
GameSack Couldnt get a hang of paintball, husky raid was pretty cool though.
GameSack You overestimate the number of people who know csr exists.
GameSack This is one my favorite systems. Its just a step below Fujitsus FM Towns I feel, but thats not a strike against it.. id have been more than happy to have one back in the days I was lusting over the Super Gun system id never have.Excellent system synopsis here, hits almost everything.
GameSack For whats its worth, Mad Stalker on PC Engine is same game (with minor changes to stage design), but with better graphics.
GameSack Damn it guys now i want an X68000. Great episode as usual :)
GameSack I really want one of these systems, you guys are lucky to have one.
GameSack Game Sack is the shiznit o bam Sally!
GameSack Music at 7:12 AMAZING
GameSack Salamander  life force?
GameSack Amazing episode. I wouldve never known about the Sharp X (with echo for emphasis) 68000 if it wasnt for you guys, so thank you!
GameSack This is the best presentation of X68000 ive seen on Youtube.Well done guys!The system was expensive back then because it was quite advanced for its time and its expensive now because its relatively rare and many of its extra components and modules are really hard to find.So, you better off finding a good emulator and some disk images if you want to experience the software firsthand.Yeah, i know its not the real thing, but you have to wonder if its really worth it to pay good money for vintage hardware.
GameSack Please do Nightmare Busters for the snes.
GameSack Have you tried Desert Demolition, Dave? its a pretty good coyoteroad runner game IMO. Not to mention also good Sheep Raider for PS1
GameSack Joe does looks like a Wookiee but less hairy.
GameSack At 13:15 theres an awesome remix of a music from alter A.I.L.A, that I cant find anywhere on the internet. Where did you find it ? I love this music and this remix sounds so cool, id like to hear the full version :)

GameSack Thank you, your videos always make me smile.
GameSack This was worth it to see the tower of genesis addons.
GameSack It would be better with a 6button layout. It would be more comfortable to use and 42 sucks for fighting and Genesis games (except racing).

GameSack I love the GBA adapter and that you can use super gameboy , so redundant!
GameSack Probably the funniest video you guys have done yet, and was informative. All packed into 12 minutes!

GameSack Speaking of Bad Apple, I wonder if Joes played Touhou much.
GameSack Oh Mummy is the first game I ever played back in 1985 on the Spectrum. Fond memories of my dad plugging the whole thing together and showing me how to play it.

GameSack SEGA  MUTANT LEAGUE FOOTBALL,,,,,NUFF SAID
GameSack Marcel komm aufm TS :D
GameSack Stormcloaks for the win.....FREEDOM FOR SKYRIM
GameSack Yep japanese companies and their ideas yep.
GameSack I like this idea, it seperates the netdeckers from the people who actually have a logical thought process, who put real time and effort into building a deck. Watch as only 1 or 2 players know how to build a deck and the rest are MAIN ENGINE! STAPLE STAPLE STAPLE.
GameSack But at San Diegos draft one last time I went, it wasnt actually draft but people giving us prebuild decks from Battle Pack cards. I know it saves time, but it was a downer for me. Even with that, they took forever to start.
GameSack Good luck using the high priestess or any other ultra rare when its not even playable in draft format, at least do some research before spreading news youre already on the site. and yes Konami is just trying out something new let them jeez worst case scenario they see a problem with the sealed draft packs and revert it back to normal, best case scenario Yugioh gets another tournament format or anything,so what if a below average player makes it through swiss theyre either not below average or will need continued good luck to continuously get amazing cards out of the packs and know how to use them.
GameSack stealing from mtg again I see lol
GameSack I love this. No more using decks they found on the internet.
GameSack This is the stupidest thing that could happen in this game People just have to complain and complain about decks instead of trying to actually play this is gonna kill the competitive scene
GameSack Who runs this business? I saw this happen in several European countries and thought: if they were to do this in the United Stated people would go crazy. I just hate the very core of this idea. By making a ban listening that changed four times a year I was applauding applauding Konami because that means more decks would see play and prices of really good cards would eventually go down because they were more likely to get hit on the approaching ban list. I thought Konami had evened the playing field somewhat. I mean, think about it. Now, playing Blackwings puts your in the Tier 1.5 to 2 area and the deck is inexpensive. But making a really childish type of YCS seems like going too far to make it fair. If you are thinking of Yugioh the same way you think of sports teams, then some decks should be naturally better than others. Idk, I just really want the toplevel and famous played to come out say say Hell No! to this idea.
GameSack In a way this is a good thing considering how easy someone can win with certain decks such as E dragons.
GameSack Road Rash 2 and Street Fighter 2.
GameSack Megaman II was the first title that came to mind, a huge improvement to the franchise in every conceivable way.
GameSack Great episode guys as always! For the longest time I didnt want to believe it, but Donkey Kong Country vs. Donkey Kong Country.
GameSack Even though Joe didnt mention it, Wonder Boy was a launch title for master system. At least it was in North America.
GameSack twisted metal!! the original was alright twisted metal 2 is one of the greatest games ever
GameSack Panzer Dragoon 2 on the Saturn was a huge step up for me from the first one. It was so much faster and I really liked the new composer. Virtua Figher 2, same thing. Faster gameplay, crisper graphics just made the game so much better. Tobal No. 2 on the PSX was also really cool. It had a 60 FPS mode that was a blast to play.
GameSack the Dr Grant pissed off had me cracking up!!! Keep up the great work guys!
GameSack You guys kick major ass! Street fighter!!!
GameSack Ive got devils crush bad ass game
GameSack snk is great. i wish they would make more games like they did on neo geo
GameSack Lol. I knew this had to be a joke when the video was less than three minutes long.Good video, Joe.
GameSack Looks like the LaserActive has some real competition...
GameSack you gotto do best soundtrack video
GameSack the god of home consoles.
GameSack that was some excellent editing joe! kudos
GameSack I remember this video. I LOLd
GameSack CHEATING WILL RESULT IN PERMANENT BAN
GameSack Best turning a WWII remote face EVERRR!
GameSack hmm... the port of Cool Spot on snes was so slow copared to Genesis
GameSack As much as I loved both, I would say the Darkness 2 wasnt as good as the original, I guess most things arent though )
GameSack Another excellent episode guys. There were a few sequels I didnt even know about but having seen some of these I think Ill give them a miss. I actually had the misfortune of owning Toejam  Earl 2 as a kid, needless to say, I mostly played the original.Keep the good stuff coming, I cant wait for the next episode!
GameSack One of the biggest disappointments for me was getting Resident Evil REmake on the Gamecube, loving the hell out of it, and then getting Resident Evil 0....and yeah...its a great looking game, but not as much fun...not as big and epic, and the partner zapping was a stupid gimmick. :(
GameSack I hate to spam like this, but Im a new channel and would love it if you could check out my latest video. Thanks! http:youtu.beWsKymmc7o84
GameSack the chick with the tude in the espn game is actually a young Suzy Kolber. She is still on espn and the host of the show NFL Live
GameSack A couple of more ideas on these: Lethal Enforcers 1 was awesome. Lethal Enforcers 2: Gun Fighters, just wasnt that great.Another one great game was Operation Wolf. Its sequel, Operation Thunderbolt, was okay especially because it was two players at the same time. To me it just didnt have the same quality that Wolf had. There are several instances where tons of knives  grenades are being thrown at you by enemies.
GameSack Maybe everyone already knows this but Excite Truck is actually a sort of follow up to Excite Bike on the NES. I heard that somewhere but I cant remember where.
GameSack KSWKriegers Schnubbel Wauzis
GameSack CKEA Commander Krieger Elite Army

GameSack The first Castlevania game had two different remakes I believe. Super Castlevania IV and Castlevania Chronicles. From what I saw it seems like a remake.
GameSack The original Flashback wasnt that hard. I completed it on my real Amiga, and I also completed the Genesis version in an emulator.
GameSack I checked the xbox store and tmnt re shelled I still available on the UK store
GameSack you forgot megaman X, oh.. you dont like it
GameSack What about Pokemon? FireRedLeafGreen andor HeartGoldSoulSilver next!
GameSack hey what bout megaman x and megaman maverick hunter x?
GameSack rocket knight adventures
GameSack Double Dragon Neon is the best remake Ive ever played.
GameSack Compare Resident Evil 1, 2, and 3 to their many remakes. said The Playstation guy...
GameSack Mit Sprachen hast dus nicht so, ne? Oder wie sonst erklrst du den flieenden bergang von der spanischen Ansage ins franzsische Kauderwelsch :D Eure Gegner hatten wirklich gute Reparatsen an Bord. Aber das stndige Rammen htte nun wirklich nicht sein mssen. Macht doch irgendwann keinen Spa mehr...
GameSack Die stiftest du auch so :P
GameSack YOU LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAD!
GameSack That was fantastic! I concur with the Otagi recommendation. Those two games dont get another love. The King of Demons looked great also. Why didnt we get that over here gosh darn it?!?!?!
GameSack how can you guys play in a forest?
GameSack Im sure someone else has already asked somewhere, but why mention D and Enemy Zero but not D2? I guess because you were talking about Saturn games in that portion and its Dreamcast? And I think Enemy Zero is worth a play, but it is a bit different. And has a weird saveload system if I remember right.
GameSack Awesome guys I wasnt even aware of some of those games. I have a soft spot for tnak controls and survivor horror games.
GameSack One of my favorite horror games is Shivers by Sierra, which was released on the PC in 1995. Youre locked inside a haunted museum on a dare and in order to escape, you have to capture all the ghosts. Some of the puzzles are insanely tough and the atmosphere is genuinely creepy. Its definitely an underrated classic and its too bad it was never rereleased. A DS port would have been great. Im hoping it will show up on Steam, but someone has to remember it exists first.
GameSack Glad to hear other people enjoyed the new Splatter house,I thought it was really good for the most part. Nice list fellas
GameSack another halloween classic!! cheers guys.
GameSack Ahh, didnt see this before I posted... it does look like this is how theyve done it though! The movement has a subtle jagged, disjointed feeling to it. Very cool.
GameSack all 3 are on mega drive
GameSack Yeah I didnt believe I did any of that stuff until Joe rolled the film. I said Is that me? Shit!
GameSack Gamesack is the reason why I have Youtube! )
GameSack Read the description. :)
GameSack great start for haloween season... Besides, 6 people never went out to that haunted house
GameSack Loved it guys ...waz awsome and alot of fun! :)
GameSack BRILLIANT!!! I swear  this is actually more scary than the modern so called horror games companies put out nowadays! They could really learn a thing or two from you guys! and I am being serious!! I especially thought the background soundtrack was especially creepy and spooky  something you never even see in horror games nowadays. hell  most horror games of today rarely even use a soundtrack and instead opt for complete silence which i think is fucking retarded and not scary at all.
GameSack Its pretty funny, your average video views are on par with your subscriber count. Maybe when you dont beg for subscriptions, you actually get a proportionate ratio like that?
GameSack Now I know youre last names! Once I get hold of a Denver phone book I can find out where you live...
GameSack The actual arcade version of Star Wars Arcade was much, much better, with a faster and more stable framefrate, better graphics, and a bigger screen, its a much easier experience than the 32X version
GameSack Akhbar sounds like hes from the Bronx. Perfect.
GameSack doom is only really good on the pc. it fucking rules on the pc in fact. what with all the mods and all.
GameSack I got a 32X in 1997 (actually it was one of my first online purchases), and love it, even if some of the games available for it are mediocre. Even those had their charm, like Cosmic Carnage, which was a scifi Art of Fighting knockoff. Highly underrated addon . Im 34 of the way to owning a complete library.
GameSack Still waiting for a dedicated Sega Genesis episode.
GameSack did you ever play Shadow Squadron in 2 player? if you had hen that segment would have been longer, and really.. its the only game the 32x needed. go play the rom and grab a friend. the best coop experience that had been released on any console and it took a couple years to see anything come on the market that could deliver as solid a 2p expirience
GameSack lol, virtual boy is way better than 32x, VB Wario Land alone is better than any game on 32x.
GameSack okay, i have the 32 x and thought the games are bad except for a few i have to ask this one question why? my hypothesis is that no body gave it a chance, which is really sad because now i wonder what couldve became of this system...i mean i ow i will neer know but seriously, why? I admit i was neer a sega fan but after buying this with spider man, doom and knuckles chaotix (reason why i bought the lot) asked me why? Joe, i know you dont answer questions but maybe you help me being a sega fan boy and all...(sorry if i sound like i am begging but i am just damn curious)
GameSack that golf game reminds me of lee carvaleos putting challenge from the simpsons
GameSack Thats another way of doing what I suggested a while back X3
GameSack When is there going to be a new damn Dantes Inferno.
GameSack I LOVED Uniracers back in the day!!!D:robblerobblerobble...
GameSack HEY! BACK OFF NOCTURNUS IN THE NIGHT! I LIKE THAT VERSION MORE THAN SYMPHONY OF THE NIGHT!
GameSack Wait, a Master System emulator console that charges 50 a game? Did I hear that right???
GameSack whats with all the violet in Saturn games
GameSack LOL  1:30.... Its pretty deep in that hole.
GameSack Im honestly surprised that almost everyone here didnt know that Ristar was made by Sonic Team, the people who make the Sonic games.
GameSack FINALLY!!! someone talks about The Mark Of Kri and how fantastic it is!!
GameSack Awww, Uniracers was always a guilty pleasure of mine and I actually got pretty darn good at it. A friend and I used to play it quite often. I never knew about the lawsuit though, pretty interesting!
GameSack How this game working out for you. I really need to jump on it and check it out. I loved the old ones
GameSack The Super Bowl hinges on the performance of Number 94....

GameSack Is this Mr Tate in disguise?
GameSack Well, well. Look who was absolutely spot on: You can sack him and give it to Giggsy for the rest of the season. Indeed. FTD, BRING BACK ANDY TATE.
GameSack Hahahaha...oh, my word. Speaking on behalf of the rest of English football fans...I fucking love this.
GameSack He doesnt have enough class to be united manager he dont care about the vintage
GameSack Please can we find this guys twitter account  I would love to read some of his thoughts
GameSack Those who are against moyes, you are really impatient and seriously are glory hunters. Just because he lost 7 games or so doesnt mean hes shite, look how good he did with Everton with a shitty squad. He just needs to feel home at united, and with the support hes being given, thats never going to happen
GameSack This guy couldnt be more right
GameSack I just realized it will be 10x as bad in the media if we get knocked out of the league cup too. With no signings in January... Moyes is about to age 10 years in 6 months...
GameSack hey almightyapeman I played the lottery had to pic 6 s the jackpot was worth 656 million I hit 3 out of the 6 s if I would of just got the other 3 right I would be a millionaire tonight well the lottery story is true that really happened a few yrs ago when I played the mega millions the 656mill jackpot is still the largest jackpot in history I almost had a piece of the pie but my point is I didnt win an I didnt sit around an say oh if I would of just picked those other 3 s blah blah if I would of waited a tad bit longer maybe that would of changed things ect ect no I realized I didnt win the lottery so all that talk SEC is overstated if GA would of had better clock management they would of beat BAMA blah blah is old worn out garbage talk the SEC has won 7 straight still looking to win 8 straight then you wanna come around an say they are overrated? you dont accomplish that many victorys by luck son every last one of them was EARNED even if another conference won this season they still got a long ways to go before catching up to the SEC we are so far ahead of everyone else till it aint even funny I suggest you quit your crying an give credit where credit is due ROLL TIDE
GameSack hello my name is sack mettenberger
GameSack Id be scared shitless to play Alabama right now.
GameSack Way to go Bana love watching our boys get this goofball
GameSack I was at this game and boy was this the most electrifying moment I have ever been a part of. You could FEEL the stadium brimming with energy that multiplied with each sack. at 1:50 when cyrus jones was getting wild that was the most wild I have ever been. Roll Tide
GameSack My favorite playbyplay, this season, thus far, by Rod Bramlett  Stan White. War.D A M N .E A G L E .

GameSack Thumbs up for the dance. Thumbs down for your attention whorish need to name it. And a silly ass name at that.
GameSack Your able to comfortably earn over 3500 dollars every month just by filling in basic online surveys at home. This website shows exactly how EARN88.COM The secret is how to adjust. I ask myself how am I going to fit into this world, and how am I going to do it without killing myself.
