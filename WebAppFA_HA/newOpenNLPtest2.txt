TopGear Sei veramente un grande meriti un sacco di iscritti solo per limpegno con cui ti metti a caricare video!
TopGear 2,000,000 for a Lamborghini Sesto Elemento? Seems reasonable.
TopGear Personally I feel that the interior is the ugliest thing in the world, but that might be just me.
TopGear only 1.95 millions? i was expecting 6...:D
TopGear My 99 geo metro would give it a good run for its money.........
TopGear The way they introduce cars amazes me so much..
TopGear This is one of those cars that I thankful they exist, but even if I had the money, I wouldnt buy one. Id rather have the Aventador.
TopGear Am I the only one that knows that this car was in the need for speed movie
TopGear Dont you mean, is it worth its two million pound price tag?.
TopGear Row, row, row your car
TopGear Sailing is really boring lolwell true that!
TopGear Haha one of my favourites!
TopGear Top gear please watch some videos from ar12 he does a series called top gear challenge please do it
TopGear 1M pounds and a leg either oneI wonder what hammond would have said if Clarkson said he wanted the middle one.
TopGear Awesome. I like sailing its fun.
TopGear The American top gear already did this like 2 years ago
TopGear I love Russian cars :)
TopGear Ferrari is way better
TopGear 6:45 Seires 20 Playlists Seriously? What gets me is that it seems noone NOONEhas noticed this! People are that ignorant these days. Yeah, its probably a typing error, series  seires. But surely TopGear can be more careful?
TopGear Pricey but awesome. Id take an 84 over a 14 any day.
TopGear I have always loved Porches
TopGear Anyone know the music in background?
TopGear whats the name of the music in the beginning?
TopGear Porsche should really learn something from those Californians
TopGear all porsches are bad and they should feel bad.
TopGear Ferrari in the handmadepassion sense is not better, if you think they are...Because Ferrari just live off their name and that all there is to it for them its about selling Ferrari merchandising and plus a Ferrari isnt that special as they arent unuque in any way. Where as Pagani or any other car maker of that sort do not live of their name, they live off what they actually do Pagani being precision, art and true quality. Actually making something which one can appreciate properly.
TopGear That was impressive! Those drifters were fun to watch. The closest I ever got to sliding like that was in my Ford Ranger pickup with 5speed Mazda manual transmission, thin tires, rear wheel drive, and a little rear axle ballast. Gets into controlled, squirrely slides when the weather is wet or snowy. Too much body roll for dry conditions though.
TopGear wanna see real drif look up in youtube arabic drift or libyan drfit ) enjoy
TopGear It looks like the Pontiac GTO
TopGear Vauxhall Monaro is to much similar to Pontiac GTO :
TopGear are there american versions of these cars?
TopGear This indeed looks exactly like a Pontiac, Especially with the double duel exhaust and the V8.
TopGear building steam with a grain of salt
TopGear Its the GTO body style
TopGear This is just stupid though, i find it hard to believe that it can cut grass at that speed anyway. So its just made to break a record. Quite silly that it would be a well known brand that did that and not some hobby mechanic or whatever.
TopGear Yeeey, excitement about a meaningless feat. Woooo
TopGear It isnt american but how american could you get?
TopGear take that to the inwood 500 in canada trapter racing friggin rights
TopGear Cut the grass at the same time or it will not count :)
TopGear Some say he holds more world records then Chuck Norris... All we know is, hes called the stig!
TopGear 200 kmh p en trdgrdstraktor! Speed Weekend FunsdalenThis video shows a speed of over 200 kmh on ice with a lawn mower. And that with studded tires. The swedish mower is geared for 246kmh but didnt get into those speeds because of the conditions.
TopGear What a useless exercise
TopGear Thanks for all of your wicked videos Docta. I think a series of reaction videos, in which you give unsuspecting onlookers a quick ride in your Aventador, would be neat. Recording their facial expressions and what not. Who knows, it may not be worth the hassle.
TopGear Goddamn automatic spoilers are SEXY! You gonna get a P1 Docta?
TopGear Incredible video of the ridiculously amazing P1! I cant imagine how much fun it was to sit in the passengers seat with Mr. Goodwin at the controls. Definitely looking forward to the POV video.
TopGear Motortrend got their hands on this one also. I think a video is coming soon. It has clips in the gtr vs Z28 video. They have some numbers on it also. It is faster then Roadandtrack 918 tested.
TopGear Hey Doc, did you get to time the lap?
TopGear Weve mixed karaoke with an 86 and put it all on the track. You wont believe what happens next...
TopGear Top Gear 18x02 ITA HD Seconda Parte
TopGear COME ONNNN! POWAAHHHHH!!!
TopGear Their reaction is better then PewDiePies i must say
TopGear Hahahaha I laughed so hard. Good Work :D
TopGear what episode is this?
TopGear Who cares if its staged, what matters is that it is entertaining and funny so the people who hate can go watch 5th gear and wear your suit and tie not your clothes you feel confutable in.
TopGear i want to se a stig lap :)
TopGear Saabs are mediocre cars at best. Theyre not horrible, and not even that unreliable as they say...problem is, like Jeremy said....The price isnt mediocre....
TopGear I love Lexus man...the latest models of IS are just amazing...they seem to be the perfect mix between luxury, sport and extravagance...I drive an Audi now,I chose Audi just because the interior felt more manly than any other cars out there, if that makes any sense...I hope one day Ill switch to one of these...
TopGear 3.7 to 60 and 202 mph was good over a decade ago not so good now
TopGear This car is over rated, cars that are cheaper and from more prestigious companies out perform this car. It just sounds really good.
TopGear I would much rather buy this over a Ferrari or Lamborghini. 4.8 liter twinturbo V10 revs to 9000 rpm says it all.
TopGear JAPANS CAR Is The Best In The World.
TopGear under power , very expensive, very stupid
TopGear Can someone send me a pink slip for this car. Thank you in advance.
TopGear Happy 700th video, Top Gear!
TopGear its so weird when you notice a car start to look dated..
TopGear Man I remember watching this like 7 years ago or something....thanks for the repost though, its a good episode.
TopGear I think the name murcilago is because the side vents open up like bat wings at high speed
TopGear Who else thought a Lamborghini should have been in the bullrun?
TopGear RUN!!!!! the Lambos are coming!
TopGear Thank you thank you thnk you for the vid!!!
TopGear what a stupid festival, even the banana festival has more sense
TopGear next time put (in game) after top gear because this is not top gear other than the track, highly disappointed
TopGear La battuta sui semafori mi ha steso ahahahaha!! comunque solo in italia i vigili sono cosi bastardi!!
TopGear Only the Stig can take a dump so ethereal that it passes right through the racesuit.
TopGear some say...that the NO OF COUSIN HE HAS is equivalent to chinas population.and some say it is because other than driving he is an effective sperm doner.....all we know....
TopGear Anyone noticed that the car review of the ford (from a couple hours ago) isnt here anymore?
TopGear LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOCOCKLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLJAMESLOLOLOLOLOLMAYLOLOLOLOLOLOL
TopGear todays teenagers... :)
TopGear I have this on my Nokia Lumia 620 :D
TopGear Some say he knows 2 facts about ducks and both of them are wrong !!
TopGear fantastico continua cos
TopGear When we or if we really should ever run out of oil, than one can make hydrogen surly its better than batteries it doesnt have to deal with short life time and long charge times. The reason hydrogen is not so populair is probably because is highly explosive and if every nut out there would have it it means government or better said people running it could face the consequences of being corrupt lol . But there are buses and boats that run on hydrogen. There are theories that oil is also produced through different chemical reaction than thought in your basic chemistry , therefor the production of oil is faster than those old school theories.
TopGear Oil will never run out Jeremy!
TopGear 6:27 Deadmau5 Superliminal. Incase anyone was wondering :D
TopGear lol high visibility jacket
TopGear Wen gas runs out Ill make more for the actual cars not those stupid plug in remote control cars
TopGear Where will the electricity come from? Thats right. Either nuclear power stations or from fossil fuel burning power stations, which both pose huge problems. Either way the worlds problems are still unsolved.
TopGear Another reason why its the BEST or nothing. MercedesBenz 3
TopGear LOL, copy of the US car show Top Gear.
TopGear what people dont understand that electricity doesnt have to necessarily come out of coal power plants so all and all electric cars would be better for the enviroment
TopGear Non ne carichi pi video di top gear?
TopGear Continua a caricarle ti prego! sei un grande!
TopGear 6 secondi ??? Un 50cc scoter fa 6 secondi
TopGear Unfortunately, Top Gear UK really overglorifies their automakers.
TopGear Which track is this?Musicwise, I mean. :)
TopGear Tired of the HP supremacy junk. So much more to a car that just that.
TopGear To be able to see the Top Gear Trio in my country seems impossible. Maybe someday this small Indonesia will be visited by Sir Clarkson, Sir Hammond and the famous and elegant Sir James. Someday. :)
TopGear thought it had a 5.9l engine not a 6
TopGear Omg, I bet this video was made by alltime10s...
TopGear Sei un mito.. grazie di cuore per questi video, mi ero stufato di rivedere ancora una volta le stesse puntate su DMAX.
TopGear Sushi vs a Hamburger.. I see what you did there!
TopGear Now, dont get me wrong, I absolutely adore American muscle, but this race was lost from the start. I mean, you picked a Mustang? A Mustang GT? Against a LOTUS?! What did you think was going to happen?Sure, Mustangs perform a bit better than your average sedan or coupe, but they are by no means a sports car. Theyre a sporty car. They were actually designed to be Muscle Car Light, so that they could be marketed towards female drivers. Unless you get into the much higher price ranges than a freaking GT, youre not going to find a good sports car unless individual modifications have been done to the vehicle. But not many people seem to know that, and I blame Ford for that (thats part of why Mustangs always leave a bit of a sour taste in my mouth).The Lotus was born and bred to be fast above all else. This wasnt a competition.
TopGear First of all why would you race it against a mustang?? The mustang is a muscle car not a sport car like the lotus. Yes it may have more horsepower or torque but it is also more heavy than the lotus. I would of preferred if you had raced it against a corvette or something similar to that. I have a feeling that TopGear only makes fun of the American vehicles by putting them against faster cars instead of actually facing them with cars that are as fast.
TopGear dont buy this shit, anyone who knows their cars can see that this is an unfair comparison
TopGear Jeremy there is new Lotus Exige S go and test it!!!
TopGear 2:41 Detroit, MiTchigan
TopGear the Mustang :ils my life ! :)
TopGear Jeremy Clarkson is just another smug fat headed prick who knows nothing about cars and hates the country that saved his from extinction, twice. What a stupid fat bastard. He compares GTs to pure sports cars. Perhaps he might be able to explain why his country does not have a single carmaker to call their own. Are all Brits such impossibly boorish buffoons?
TopGear that was not fair ... mustang is much heavier
TopGear Prima visualizzazioneeeeee
TopGear Il doppiatore di Jeremy Clarkson  quello di Capitan Barbossa???
TopGear Holy hell is that a well set up car. He barely had to touch the wheel down the straight.
TopGear Top Gear 19x07 ITA HD Speciale Africa Seconda Parte
TopGear What does he mean the car will dissolve if you drive it too quickly?
TopGear God theyre looking old
TopGear Top Gear is da Best !!
TopGear These Top Gear Uk people are getting very old.
TopGear Ferrari 458 Italia is my favourite car. :DDD
TopGear I know that Top Gear tends to use soundtracks from movie, but from Assassins Creed 3?A video game?I was astonished ..
TopGear Yeeeeeeessss.. a.c.3 for jeremys run. Mind blown.
TopGear Im surprised they all chose the Ferrari
TopGear Put the new stingray against the supercharged jag.
TopGear Hopefully by the time they do the Porsche v the McClaren, James can drive Ferrari the Ferrari, or even better, a road trip with the 3 cars.
TopGear 21 is one of your Best! Great job! Seriously wish u guys liked each other a little more, that way we could get more episodes out of a series PAlso, I want more focus on the Dacia!!!
TopGear I think they need to drive a new keonigsegg. Theyre such fanboys ofthe bugatti veyron that they wont drive a better car on the show .
TopGear Well, somebody know something about romanian cars.
TopGear i personally think this is best season in awhile
TopGear they have a new stig the old one was micheal shummacer but hes in a coma ski accident
TopGear Really enjoyed this series.
TopGear The Chernobyl episode was not faked but filled with radiophobic nonsense about it being unhabitable for 250 thousand years etc.
TopGear E la seconda parte di questo speciale? Ti prego mettila!!! Grazie sei fantastico :))
TopGear Kiedy mieszkalem jeszcze w PL to marzylem o Leonie (aucie)
TopGear Shes one of the few girls I can listen to talk forever.
TopGear My new favorite singer. I dont even like her music.
TopGear So many beautiful cars.
TopGear Perfect marketing strategy!
TopGear Jarod Gould That is the top gear live supercar garage. She actually doesnt own any of them. She does say in the vid though that she does have a 458 and is getting the 458 speciale, but her 458 isnt that 458 in the vid either. as she said hers had nicer seats lol
TopGear Too bad she cant go on full throttle
TopGear Exclusive Supercar Garage Tour with Amy Macdonald  Top Gear Live 2014
TopGear Ma dove li trovi questi video?
TopGear Im still alive, anyone want my recipe?
TopGear Why dont you guys try out the Chrysler srt8
TopGear Look at the piece of crap they gave him to drive. I wouldnt have stopped til it was ready for the crusher lol
TopGear some say that blue color on his visor is from smoking too much blue meth
TopGear Jesse, weve got work to do
TopGear Supermarket Soire with Dr. Dick Pebis!
TopGear this dude is such a jerk off.
TopGear Both the Ferrari and McLaren shouldve done atleast 200mph but I guess the weather and wind had a big impact. Because I know the Ferrari tops out at like 202 and the McLaren at 207ish. The Audi tops out of 190.
TopGear These cars work fine there but what if the gravity was lower?
TopGear pay attention ...they never put the 911 turbo s to compete with these cars ,cuz they know the Porsche will beat all of them!
TopGear Wooooo!!!! MCLAREN!!!!!!
TopGear The McLaren MP412C Spider is amazing!!
TopGear Whats with the matching shirts? XD
TopGear May  Im sorry the gates closedClarkson  Cant you just open it?May  NEIN! lololololololol
TopGear you know, ive got some unused items. my radio for example and some pens. but i dont have an unused INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT!!!
TopGear Nice video mate. WTAC car was very quick indeed.
TopGear Some say hes The Stigs teenage cousin. All we know is, when hes not driving, hes playing RaceTheStig. Download FOR FREE at http:bit.ly1qbsi7S
TopGear This new Top Gear: Race The Stig App is brilliant! I cannot stop playing it!
TopGear I always thought the Stigs teenage cousin would have pimples on his helmet...
TopGear awesome ad, terrible ripoff of a game
TopGear from the title i thought it was a some kind of competition so i was so glad cuz i thoght im going to race The Stig
TopGear Some say he has the same Nexus 7 tablet as me :)
TopGear Is this the UK version? If not Im not giving a damn
TopGear taga dine lang ako eh, sayang di ko kayo nakita.
TopGear Clarkson is a nob, cyclists stay in shape unlike fat drivers xD
TopGear The rules are the rules and it doesnt matter because the ONE is going to stomp that piece of shit American scrap iron car.
TopGear Considering that the GTR is my favorite car, Im going to need new fucking eyes after seeing that GTR Convertible. To whomever created that monstrosity, fuck you!
TopGear The Vyron hit 273 point something but it didnt do it on the way back at the same speed so f u commenter of the weak. Thats why they have to do the run in both directions!!
TopGear when did you record this? all of these happened over the weekend and today.
TopGear That dbag can never replace Paul Walker.
TopGear False. Theoretically weight has nothing to do with top speed except that it increases rolling resistance which slows the car down but just by a tiny amount. All it does is it takes longer to reach that top speed.
TopGear FYI D squared , he already went on top gear and he was the fastest star in a reasonably priced car with a 1:44.7 seconds. Great show by the way.
TopGear FLDQoftheD: I think it will turn into a small franchise, but not nearly have the success of The Fast and The Furious. Not putting the movie down...hell, I havent even seen it yet. Just my opinion, also averaging in what Ive heard on the street what ppl think about the film already. Not saying its gonna suck a fat babys balls, buuuuuut....ppl are expecting a FLOP. I hope it does well myself. Awesome show 2day team. Great job as always!
TopGear Kiedy mylelimy, e Golf GTI jest wzorcem kompaktowego hot hatcha, Volkswagen pokaza wersj R i zburzy porzdek tego segmentu.TOPGEAR POLSKA:http:www.topgear.com.plhttps:www.facebook.comTopGearPolska
TopGear the most glorious moment in Top Gear history.
TopGear 2:06 you left your wallet in there sir !
TopGear James, its a track day car! DUH!!!!
TopGear I see the 620 as a car you would keep in a garage and only take it out a few times a year and only run it on a track. The 160 is the car you take out to the country lanes every single weekend, give it a good thrashing, then pull in to a pub and have a steak pie dinner.
TopGear Nothing but wet lol. Cool clip of the Stig getting sideways.
TopGear Please release the onboard every week for his drives.
TopGear amazing gear shifting  Stig you are the best
TopGear it sounds like an old rally car!
TopGear So, what was the lap time? And how does it compare to the others on the board?
TopGear That little car sounds like baby lion or tiger ROARRRRRRAnd who is the stig!!!!!!!!!?
TopGear La Mustang bella, potente e relativamente economica..si e poi fa 4,5 km con 1 litro, ed ha un serbatoio da 50 L.
TopGear Cars on fire  a typical night in Surrey?
TopGear I would gladly accept it if you guys donate the subaru, dont put them on fire.
TopGear Some say hes cold blooded, and that driving while on fire increases his fuel efficiency. But all we know for sure, is that hes the Stigs dragon cousin!
TopGear CAN I PUT FLAMES ON MY CAR?!?!?!?
TopGear theyre really on fire!
TopGear Is this the same guy who designed the Bond car in the first series? He sure has gone bald!
TopGear LIES! We all know the stig comes up with these crazy machines...Stop trying!
TopGear We got kids starving and these dudes makin cars out of washing machines amd blenders smh lmao
TopGear Is it legal to conduct such test on open road?
TopGear I must say even though its irrelevant im surprised european cars work so good in the snow over here in canada my 97 audi a4 i bought as my first ever car and this was my first winter driving one of thee coldest ive ever experianced and most snow my car had less problems then my fathers jeep and my buddies truck im very satisfied with german engineering
TopGear Nick Dalton sounds a lot like Baron VonGrumble, although I know he isnt le baron :).
TopGear Great to see the videos being up to date, great stuff! :D
TopGear I drove one close to 40 years ago when they were the Lotus Seven. Even the with the 1600 cc Ford engine you could do 45 degree power slides on dry pavement. That was long before drifting was even though of. The only problem was the windshield, it was like trying to push a barn door through the air, so your top speed was about 80 mph or 130 kph. But on a twisty road they are a huge amount of fun.
TopGear thanks for broadcasting it in german  if you do it, when only with original (english) audio and german subtitles, not this gossiplevel wich they translate to...And lool at TG in Spain (brain overload coming :D )And btw: TG Australia has been RUINED with Season3, Season 2 was waaay better, season 1 was meh (mostly because of the primary host...)
TopGear The only thing that you can get a chance to win a free email service and the Price of the King of the Crown Estate is the most popular and the Price of the Crown Estate. The comments for your help. I have been a while to get your free time to time but I think the best way to get the best way to get the best way for the use of a new York City of London and the Price of course the UK and Ireland and Wales with company number of people who are looking for a couple of weeks ago by the way, and the Price of the Crown Estate
TopGear I love the original, and prefer to watch it in the original version, but I have to say that the German voices actually fit pretty well.
TopGear Im mexican, obviously my mother tongue is Spanish, however I cant stand anything the Spanish voice acting or abything else than the original. It simply is unnatural.
TopGear when you will come to saudi arabia
TopGear I loved the Ashes episode. One of the best they made.
TopGear Most Widely Watched Factual Television Programme in the World my gluteus maximus, does anyone remember their take on the Tesla roadster. Love the show but its only factual when it suits them.The High Court in London rejected Teslas libel claim, claiming the series is an entertainment programme and not an information programme.
TopGear no thanks keep the real voice
TopGear 5:00 The first time i drove a Mono it set fire to itself, the second time the engine went wrong and the third time it broke down before it even had left the factory. ...so its another typical British badly executed good idea...Its a bit like the Danish Zenvo.
TopGear music at 0:33 is from need for speed undercover :D
TopGear Top Gears production team reminds us why theyre the best. Great video. I wasnt expecting the car to be that expensive, though.
TopGear how about a drag race atom 500 vs bac mono
TopGear The Brits have to learn how to punt their unions so they can make stuff that actually works.
TopGear Absolutely beautiful!!
TopGear Is this car comparable to the Ariel Atom?
TopGear Start listening from 2:10 and onward. I loled so hard when he said If I was a girl... bit. XD
TopGear TopGear has been dubbed in pretty much every language around the world.
TopGear Dubbing is the Work of Satan.
TopGear There are several translations into Castellano... two dubbers for each in Spain, as well as the Spanish American version...
TopGear Scandinavia, probably the only place where we do not dub shows or movies... in the woooorld.
TopGear i had a honda commercial before this video.
TopGear i always watch Top Gear in english, at 1:06 i tought that language sounds so stupid...than i realised it was german, no wonder other countries make jokes bout our language.
TopGear I love the Spanish and Italian, just for sheer comedy. I also remember seeing Top Gear in German whilst on a school trip in Germany (and I only, vaguely speak French). That was interesting.
TopGear Hammond kind of sounds right in spanish. Jeremy sounds right in German and May in propah pucca English. Dont know if everyone will get what I mean
TopGear Latvian !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear I actually prefer the original sound with sub!!
TopGear Dubai isnt a country, its in the UAE well done for insulting them
TopGear Mexico!!!! In LOVE Top Gear
TopGear someone needs to brush his teeth lmao
TopGear This is why top gear is my favorite show ever awesome vid :)
TopGear Still my favorite go to the Atom
TopGear Fendered at the front, Open Wheel at the back, strange.
TopGear If I was a girl, Id like it very much
TopGear Some say that Stig is headless and Jemery wears his helmet.
TopGear No, i need an ipad, i couldnt watch this utrerly brilliant video without it!!
TopGear i want two...one in black on black matte
TopGear I counted 22 you knows, you know..?
TopGear If id get a dollar for every single time he says you know, Id be millionaire.
TopGear Cant get eyes off that P1 :)
TopGear Only conversations. Just wanna know how the military ride made up
TopGear more behind the scenes pls
TopGear A lovely bit of kit? Really? I am of British decent I am first generation Canadian. I am so glad I dont talk like that. By the way its not a torch its a flash light!!! I am not your mate!! I am your friend. And I dont smoke fags!! I smoke cigarettes! Thats all done bitching eh!! Lol
TopGear who the hell funds this?!
TopGear omg i cant wait till topgear comes barbados :D im here waiting !
TopGear TOP GEAR NEEDS TO UPLOAD THEIR SHOWS ON THEIR WEBSITE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE OR HERE! Otherwise millions miss seeing it like me in canada where it ls always old repeats
TopGear How about this ... Dancing CarsCar choreographer Colin Sangster explains how to make cars dance for Top Gear Live 2014, Glasgow. Find out where the live show is going next http:www.topgearlive.comlocationsVia Top Gear fordfocus  topgear  letsdance :)
TopGear Oh look a god driving.... Loki take the wheel!
TopGear I dont have a smartass comment for this one....thats rather unusual.
TopGear Tom has given me a new look on life, I would really love to met him.
TopGear he is so gorgeous. crying
TopGear i reckon loki would have road rage. god forbid anyone gets in his way on the road.
TopGear Is it weird that I keep seeing huddlestone?
TopGear he sounds like hes a dj on the radio
TopGear This was one of the best top gear episode in my opinion
TopGear Why do I not hear Americans on the Oracle team USA boat? They sound rather AustralianNew Zealandish? (Forgive me for not being able to tell the difference in accents between those 2 countries.)
TopGear Can any body tell me what is the name of the toyota plz
TopGear 7:51 HAHAHA the look of do my eyes deceive me
TopGear Thumbs up for May beating up Clarkson! Not for the wind power vs gas thing. It is just that everytime Clarkson looses, I get to smile...
TopGear 2.47 min do u see the flying fishs ??
TopGear Mr Clarkson, how do you explain your door frame is BLUE at 5:31 while its back to RED at 5:40? I thought the original blue car was down at that point... Another fun but madeup episode, Im afraid.
TopGear 5:31 the door sill is blue. Then hes back in the red car. Are the editing skills starting to get weak?
TopGear Jeremy  o sarcasmo puro!
TopGear Season 21 spoiled 2 secrets of the Stig in 1 episode:He has a Norwegian accent, and he hates the rain
TopGear I love the Kia Ceed. We cant get it here in the US any more. So, alas, I drive a Hyundai. Not bad, but not as cool as a Ceed.
TopGear Guys...the Norwegian accent is misleading. If it were true, they would have edited it out..
TopGear Stig is former formula 3 driver. Thats all I know
TopGear Some say Stig is Mika Hakkinen
TopGear grande, continua a caricare le nuovi stagioni ti prego
TopGear I clicked the Dislike button simply because, as an exPorsche owner, I couldnt bear to watch a supercar being torched.
TopGear That was beautiful....
TopGear I feel as though Jeremy had something to do with this...
TopGear That girl is so hot...because of fire I mean.
TopGear 272 people treats money as a requirement for the universe to exist
TopGear Awesome performance. This must be Clarksons idea. How does the 911 not explode?
TopGear A burning porsche will always remind me of Paul Walkers death smh to soon for burning porsche videos anyone else agree
TopGear Look like another ghosh riders car
TopGear Can I have that 911 now ?!!!!
TopGear CALL 911!! THERES A FIRE
TopGear Im a fan of this show and I think this is pointless
TopGear The funniest 20 seconds of Top Gear ever!!!
TopGear Jesus christ, more people who have no idea how he law works. If it does not have a motor it does not need to about traffic laws. You wouldnt stop a bike for speeding. Stupid misguided crap.
TopGear I did only cycle when i had no car (last time was when i was 18)
TopGear They should also do a PSA on FLs law needing at least 3 feet to pass a cyclist. Considering Ive been sideswiped twice since January Though, I cant complain. I have an open lawsuit with the city bus, so Ill make a decent settlement of that for not being able to lift weights for 2 weeks
TopGear Fuck anyone that rides a bike on the roads. Get the fuck out of the way you cunts. I always run them off the roads when I see them
TopGear Im offensive and I find this visually impaired!
TopGear Okay, as long as Car drivers observe the minimum safe passing distance. (I dont run reds BTW)
TopGear Absolutely nailed it. Cyclists are a menace. www.SpareTheRoad.com
TopGear Disliked, promotes the stupid Us vs Them mentality.
TopGear TIL TopGear is making a cameo in Phineas and Ferb
TopGear Permission to say oh cock
TopGear 0:33 lol agent shark LOlolOlol
TopGear Top Gear hat einen Youtubekanal, bei dem Sie sich gut und gerne 420h aufhalten knnen. Alles auf englisch und um Lngen schner als auf deutsch
TopGear Unfug  Schwachsinn  Schwachfug
TopGear hahahahahahahahahahaha they could have put a Prius at the end too
TopGear Ha ha this is sooo funny... Even though Im a cyclist.. A car driver and a bus driver!!!
TopGear ...and he wants an Oris diverWHAT THE FUCK? NO ONE WANTS AN ORIS DIVER!!I find Archibald an overbearing, pretentious prick most the time (not that hes trying to be anything other than exactly that) but I have to admit, I had a good laugh at that one. Sign of hardship at Volvo I suppose  head of design aspires own a watch that costs a few hundred quid.
TopGear Haha!!! Classic shit!!
TopGear 100 support to my man Archie!
TopGear I thought a Jazzmaster was a guitar. Must be for jazz musicians. Scraping the barrel for appropriate watch names me thinks. The Speedmaster, GMT Master, Seamaster and Yachtmaster are already taken you fucking arseholes! Whats next, the fucking Bicyclemaster?
TopGear They advertise dog shit to people that know nothing about watches because most people wont spend over 300 dollars on a watch. People think they will get a good watch when its in fact, like Archie said its dog shit haha.
TopGear This just has to be Archies best video!
GameSack HAHA ! Bei 1:48 httest du so laut im TS geschrien D
TopGear One of the best shows on TV ever. Just love these guys.
TopGear Did they all inhale a bunch of helium?
TopGear what happened to the voices????
TopGear I cant explain how awesome you guys are.
TopGear They copy Top Gear UK on everything, so unoriginal.
TopGear i fucking burst out when he called him tesco
TopGear Sexiest facking horse ever! I mean... you know when they Mustang was drifting all hardcore and for as long as it could? I got nothing
TopGear May: aw, aw, aw, aw, aw, aw .LOL
TopGear Im no expert but those look like some small horses
TopGear These werent horses they were ponies. The only one not too big for them was Richard and even he looked silly on them. Still it made me laugh. Just the sight of enormous Jeremy on that little pony brought tears to my eyes. Hilarious!
TopGear I am dying to see the full episode of this.. I couldnt stop laughing this was bloody hilarious!
TopGear I know I always count on the boys!!!!
TopGear As a cyclist Ive had 3 traffic accidents, since I got a car I didnt crash at all!Except for that one time I thought I could drift round a corner hmm
TopGear Maiq tried to cycle once, but Maiqs tail got stuck in the back tire. This was very uncomfortable to Maiq.
TopGear As a cyclist, I endorse this message.
TopGear You British people dont know what cycling really is... Come to the netherlands and we speak again
TopGear i hate cyclists, germany and china.
TopGear How to keep cycling safe in England? Keep Clarkson and May off of bikes XD
TopGear So what did we learn today?!  get a car!!
TopGear sir alec clarkson hehe
TopGear Burmas long distance lorries  Top Gear Burma Sp: http:youtu.bevyPYarCidxM
TopGear The Three Comrades, I love them, I swear.
TopGear )         ,         Marussia b2      ,  Lamborghini Aventador  McLarenLooked totally loved this series) I do not know you read this post or not, but I would like that you tested Marussia b2 along with other sports cars such as Lamborghini Aventador or McLaren
TopGear Well they say youre not a real rider until you have been thrown off at least once. So congratulations, Richard. :) I do hope your wrist gets better soon though. And just for the record... it is SO cool to see some real horsepower on TopGear
TopGear Ppl make ur shit stop lyin
TopGear Where are the Crown Comforts, Crews and Prii?
TopGear Yeah I think the Indian taxi  the hindustan ambassador modeled off the old morris wins the race.
TopGear Who uses a stretch limo as a taxi? What would they use as a limo to step up the game from taxis? Maybachs? And to be honest America doesnt just use crown vics anymore, lately Ive seen more Scions and Escapes and Camrys and... well they seem to just use anything nowadays to the point we just dont have a steady taxi anymore.
TopGear That lap could have been improved
TopGear I like the idea of this film angle. Now they need to show what its like in something actually fast like a Ferrari.
TopGear haha, thats epic. pretty burnouts, who would have thought?!
TopGear hey, just to let the britbongs know, Im america a series is the entire run of the show. for us a Season is a Series for you. so us americans heard them say last shoot of the series, makes us think that the show is ending forever.
TopGear this one is the best i think :)
TopGear One questionHammond was pulled over by police,used to stop and accelerate to waste fuel and time and still at last Clarkson was behind him.Staging Failed!!!!!!!!!!!!
TopGear Dear BBC. What Series is this? So that I can buy this when it comes out :D
TopGear They should have opened the windows
TopGear lol ignorant prius owners should hate this episode. :P
TopGear poor cars.. they are going to break those engines using the rev limiter the whole time
TopGear hands down fukushima is worse.
TopGear What happened to Jeremy, once he ran out.

TopGear That sounds AMAZING!!!! Damn i love that 6.2 engine. going to miss it with this 5.5 biturbo stuff AMG is putting out
TopGear that mustache what the f.. youve decided to get older, Richard?
TopGear I live in the western u.s. the six wheeler is perfect for the terrain. Of course, Id add a fifty gallon auxiliary fuel tank.
TopGear Richard looks like Robert Downey Jr.
TopGear second i saw it was wet, with this car, i knew it would be an oversteery lap.
TopGear I have to agree with May, windshield... Please....
TopGear why it has to be screenshot with shit music?
TopGear Watching this now on BBC America.
TopGear loved it, another epic journey with a finale that left me on the edge of my seat! :3 :DD The best show in the world!
TopGear oh god this is going to be funny
TopGear Good special cant wait
TopGear Christ I cant wait for this...
TopGear I also believe Ryan Dale enjoys being dominated.
TopGear Looks killer, but performs poorly.
TopGear Its a shame a BMW M5 is faster than this in the wet.
TopGear you can hear dat turbo:)
TopGear he slows down on purpose!
TopGear Have to say, I really enjoy the Stigseyeview of a lap. You really get the idea of how hard ol Stiggie works, especially on a wet lap like that one was, as well as the line he takes and how he sets up.Grazie, Top Gear.
TopGear That steering wheel is ugly as hell.
TopGear Looks like a crossbreed between an R8 and an ISF.
TopGear Vaya coche... es inconducible
TopGear Lol, I just caught this Episode on BBC Canada, they changed the music. Guess EA Decided to be a dick about the copyright on that music
TopGear soooo did they pay for the track?
TopGear they removed this track from the US broadcast :(
TopGear Some say he punched a reporter in the face ...twice. All we know, hes called Commander Shepard.
TopGear Love his reaction when the FF and SLS are driving up
TopGear Just big children playing with their toys...!! Enjoy...
TopGear Was no one else creeped out by this guys profile pic?

TopGear He said You know 22 times in a three and a half minute speech!
TopGear am I the only one that sometimes feel the humor in Top Gear is a bit too obvious?
TopGear That was absolutely amazing ....
TopGear already seen it in UK
TopGear You learn something new about Hammond every day
TopGear Im so looking forward to this :)
TopGear Did he gain weight his cheeks look kinda chunky, of is it the helmet, either way hes still cute
TopGear Bill Murray is fucking riot! lol
TopGear at did end did Norton say Mark Walhberg, ladies and gentlemen?
TopGear he looks like mrs doubtfire.
ZONEofTECH normally only full partners get thumbnails and store and those things, but Im also not a full partner but I have custom thumbnails and store, I dont know why but Its awesome. One way you can become a full partner is signing with full screen network, but youll need around 500 active subscribers, and 70,000 video views, so I think you just need to work on subscribers and then contact them :)
TopGear Want great audio when filming cars? Hear our results with the VideoMic Pro  VideoMic GO that we took to the Top Gear Festival in Sydney.
ZONEofTECH You wasted your money, When I got GTA IV it was 20 dollars, for a new copy, You bought this just for a silver plastic case that costs 25 to 30 dollars? Come on man you could have just gotten the original casing.
ZONEofTECH Does it come with a uplay code
ZONEofTECH bine ba romanasule esti tare

GameSack i watched this when i was really shit with renek and used this build, IT SUCKED HARD, i made my own build practised in tonnes of bot games then was persuaded into a pvp match, i did ok, so i kept at pvp, now im brilliant with the guy and hes my main :D long story short this vid is pretty useless
GameSack i go dorian shield. CD shoes, than sunfire cape or brutalizer depending ow how much they stck armor. if too much mgc i go Taht armor with more regen cdr, ofc i go max armor pen runes, defens masteries 921, haven quite figure out 2 last items, sicnce this is sick build usualy ends with resign :) Warmonger obviusly not helping since ulti insta heal, revive armor is good vs like khrtus (with zenoia and other with this armor) all rest is dead on actualy def build (or you can escape).
GameSack so this is why its true dmg now...
GameSack spam? is you a retatrd?
GameSack BEEP ........................... BUUP

GameSack BTW, you can turn off Key Clicks at the setup in ventrilo!

TopGear sympa le dlc de forza 4
TopGear How do you make your lap time list?
TopGear Even cheaper than the ones you did today
TopGear tommykaira zz vs lambo gallardo lp570
TopGear yeah. Audi rs4 and subaru impreza
TopGear why is it that turn10studio always makes the same dlc packs for forzathis is all most the same dlc pack as in forza horizon and forza 4im not going to download this one if I have a xone
TopGear Come on turn 10, give us some more gt cars. People are really like the gt mini endurance events. The game is crying out for cars like the gallardo gt3, mp412c gt3, bmw z4 etc. Please make it happen.
TopGear Leave it to Turn 10 to add a new DLC with 1 new car that everyone still has to pay for. Now im glad my game and console got stolen, so i dont have to waste money on F5 dlc
TopGear Turn 10 why do you add the Hummer to almost every Forza? It is slow as Maple Syrup and you guys never make a proper track for the Hummer
TopGear Idea: add some cars most people actually want Ill name a few C7 stingray, Ftype14 M4M3, Lamborghini veneno, Porsche 918 spyder, Porsche 911(any),etc. now dont even get me started on tracks. Just please for lack of a better way of explain it be more like GT6
TopGear This game is garbage compared to Forza 4
TopGear clubs next update right?
TopGear Uhhh I doubt top gear would have selected the hummer. Maybe as a joke car.
TopGear Its funny, because I won one of the wheels from the xb1 v8 supercar
TopGear These should have been in the original release.
TopGear Even though weve already had the majority of these cars previously, for the first time its a good group of cars
TopGear Where is the hover van.

GameSack last 30 seconds of video were freaking hilarious
GameSack Will, please ditch the music. Or lower it significantly. Its really distracting.
GameSack racdude01 TY for spoiling :D
GameSack JamesBerg86 thx! will do!
GameSack I think what Steve is trying to say is that the FreddieW contributors are not donating to a nonprofit, they are investing in a forprofit. Whenever you invest in a for profit, and it does well, you receive a return on that investment. So what is the return? Videos? That seems a little weak. He could just rent his videos for that matter. Because I could invest in anything from savings to the market and receive anywhere from .0001 to at least 5 in return.
GameSack I dont know if you remember Will but at the start of this yearend of last year you predicted that RWJ would pass RyanHiga interms of Subscribers, and you were spot on. And a couple of videos ago you predicted that Freddiew might surpass RWJ. I think you are going to be right once again considering what freddiew is doing atm.
GameSack Will what Steve was trying to say is that Freddie is already making tons of money off his videos alone. So to ask for another 75K, seems to beg the question, what should be done with the money he was already making off youtube videos? Further more, why did Freddie need to raise an extra 75K? Youre telling me he couldnt finance the series out of his own pocket? BS. Freddie is a top youtuber, he could have easily financed with the money hes made off youtube already. So why the extra 75K?
GameSack For the popularity of this show, you think it would picked up in production value by now.
GameSack I love the way he has made a lovely intro and spent time and effort to make a wonderful set and then chosen to film it all from an angle that shows off the wires and folded up curtain in the corner. A few more back boards wouldnt go a miss there Will, maybe a little fillerpaint to get rid of that distracting line in the middle of the set. :)
GameSack wedgeii2 The only way I know of is going to the top right corner beside the video, on your homepage, and clicking the x. It might be a glitch, in which case, your only option is to wait it out.
GameSack Hooray! Youre finally going on the Partners Project!
GameSack Geez, I have nothing against gay people, but I could only listen to your voice for so long before all hell breaks loose.
GameSack Smosh or freddiew should really be on the top 3 most subscribed :P
GameSack I dont get why shaytards is going down, I think its better than ever
GameSack MartinezMKD Naw man,I think she is funny. Certainly better than ijustine.
GameSack hmmmm.. new smosh video or new wil of dc, I pick will of dc
GameSack I am canadian and i say mario as mario and not mayrio.. goodness gracious!
TopGear Add a message to your video
TopGear Never realised that describing the slope of a bridge is in somehow racist.It is not racist and would be a shame if the show got pulled.Guess it was a slow day for the lawyer. How do Asians manage to use a ski slope without being mortally offended ? Had to Google it, seems that as well as being used to describe a gradient, it is an acronym for Silly Little Opium Peddling Easterner. Much the same way that some irish gypsies are described as Caravan Using Nomadic Travelling Salesmen...
TopGear I saw a bunch of slopes during the winter Olympics. Does that make me observant, correct or racist?
TopGear Fuck off Somi, get a life, you idiot!! Viva Clarkson!!!
TopGear I love the way the LFA sounds. Omg
TopGear Love to have the peterbilt
TopGear Cant wait for you to post more
TopGear Hay I love your vids man keep uploading.  max
TopGear An Aerostar?!?! Im so disappointed in you Tanner...
TopGear That john Deere is soooo old
TopGear I so want to be on this show with you guys
TopGear I really tried to watch a full episode of us edition, but line with cubic inches just made me sick...
TopGear aye tho aye! this show sucks and also that Scout II isnt an original. It has the Axles from an FJ Land Cruiser! Therefore this truck is part Japanese! Japan made it up there! and besides that. Only Japanese trucks have made it up there more than once. Bring these trucks down and take em up again. They wont last another mile lol Well maybe the FJ Axles will. But you can take those off that piece of shit Scout and re use em on a better truck like an actual FJ Land Cruiser
TopGear Haventhey not heard of james may, who did tbis DURING theberuption
TopGear LOL, great to watch but the really over hype the danger. They know exactly what is ahead....they have camera crews and producers tagging along and up ahead to set up shots. Almost as fake as the ice road trucker idiots.
TopGear What is the music at 27:27?Who does it? It sounds awesome!
TopGear so every episode has screwed up audio.. congratulations!
TopGear TANNERS AWESOME AND TOP GEAR UK IS LAME LOSERS

ZONEofTECH So does that mean i can talk faster on iPhone 5C?
ZONEofTECH also you have over 5000 mail on 4s and none on 5c
ZONEofTECH How did you get the Touch ID app? Normally it isnt an app
ZONEofTECH What did I just see! They were using iPads as labels for the new phones!!! (Ive never been inside a apple store so this is new for me)
ZONEofTECH its actually not the first reversible cable. there is other cables out there that can go in 360 degrees. like the one that goes into the samsung chromebook
ZONEofTECH I Got iPhone 5c Green
ZONEofTECH The hello is German. It is also Dutch, but that doesnt fit with the text beneath it.
ZONEofTECH Okay so if I order it from an ATT store will a sim card be included?
ZONEofTECH Green is so bauthifull
ZONEofTECH will the plans on vodophone work in the U.S.?
ZONEofTECH Lol, Hallo is not spanish... Hola is in spanish but great review... I subscribed.
ZONEofTECH It was japanese. Konichiwa
ZONEofTECH is there a redeem code to enter??
ZONEofTECH My favorite was san andreas afcourse
ZONEofTECH Im buying gta 5 right now
ZONEofTECH Well not everything but almost everything its still America just the states and the citys and the street names and the car names and other stuff are based on things in real life with made up names always been that way
ZONEofTECH Dont worry about the graphics, your playing on the ps3. Its always beautiful on this machine.
ZONEofTECH A best phone review i ever saw. Thanks!!
ZONEofTECH That (pretty pretty) gets me every time 3 and hes cute xD
ZONEofTECH Zoneoftech, my name is Justus. I realized youd always say just. Lol
ZONEofTECH hey arent you the amazing spider man?? :D
ZONEofTECH i want blue i watched all your videos and finished five steps plus told my 3 friends to watch it and tell their three friends to watch it so it becomes a chaib.
ZONEofTECH i would like to win the blue one
ZONEofTECH give me the iphone5c in black plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
ZONEofTECH why is it a fail.., it looks nice!
ZONEofTECH Follow me on Instagram ITZMIKEE
ZONEofTECH You should do more research BEFORE trolling like this. I didnt swear you! Its clear that you have nothing else in your head besides a peasized brain. Im sorry I wasted 5min of my time trying to be nice and reply to a person with a 1 digit IQ.
ZONEofTECH 56!!!! SERIOUSLY?!?! HAHA
ZONEofTECH same shit diff toilet. new processor, dual flash and touch ID. yeah thats worth hundereds of dollars. Sticking with my 5 until iphone 8
ZONEofTECH 7:17 Dont mean any offense, (not much knowledge on the topic either) but this iHealth would be very neat. But what they had shown on the screen was the Nike iPod App.
ZONEofTECH This cant be released soon enough.
ZONEofTECH I do try to reply to as many questions as I can, especially to people like you, who only ask serious and important questions. I really hate it when I work 10h for a video, especially when I am in the middle of nowhere and work my as.s to find a McDonalds to upload a video, and that video still gets more dislikes than likes, simply because people did not read the title. I believe you know which video I am talking about. :(
ZONEofTECH funny video and a cool video at the same time ! hahaha
ZONEofTECH huh, sooo htc one is plastic? research before you comment...if you can...
ZONEofTECH In that case, still better than shit  crap.
ZONEofTECH The name of the song in the end ?
ZONEofTECH was spamt ihr dummen kinder hier rum ? ich wollte mir die Keynote anschaun und nicht irgentwelche Fratzen....
ZONEofTECH Windows Phone i love you!
ZONEofTECH I have a stupid iphone5 but Im getting gs4
ZONEofTECH Cheap my ass i love it
ZONEofTECH YOU ARE AWESOME ZONE OF TECH!!!!. Thanks for updating us about the apple products.
ZONEofTECH Breaking bad and dexter ..man you deserve the subscribe (Y)
ZONEofTECH Xbox one  trash ps4 all the way playstation nation
ZONEofTECH this guy is clearly over excited for no reason xbox onetrash
ZONEofTECH Eu teas sfatui sa mergi pe PS4. Playstation  e doar 50 pe an, deci nu poti sa zici ca e o cheltuiala foarte mare. Gandestete cum te vei simti cand vei cumpara Battlefield 4, stiind ca exista o varianta la acelasi pret, cu grafica de 10000x de ori mai buna, pentru PS4. :) Cheers!
ZONEofTECH you look like the new spiderman
ZONEofTECH Thx Sam :) I worked really hard on this video!
ZONEofTECH Yeah ...I know...it does suck. But there will most likely be workarounds on how to get iOS 7 on the iPod Touch 4th gen. If that is the case then I will definitely do a tutorial video showing you how to do that.
ZONEofTECH i want the iphone 5c more than 5s honstly
ZONEofTECH Yeah, I truly am pretty active. I have a huge list of videos I need to finish, before reviewing the iPhone 5 and iPad Mini (which I havent shown you yet). Too bad I do not have a strong community yet :(
ZONEofTECH I did the first like and the first comment. I love your videos
ZONEofTECH In what way have I overused myself? Was the intro too long or the ending?
ZONEofTECH does it transfer the audio to the tv too?
ZONEofTECH Hey Just, Yes, I am still thinking whether or not to buy a console or to build a hardcore gaming PC. If Ill be getting a console I will definitely do an unboxing video, a review video and a LOT of gaming videos :) So stay tune for that :D
ZONEofTECH thats what she said hahahahah
ZONEofTECH :D Thx Batman! I bet you only subscribed because of my Batman voice :))
ZONEofTECH I would love to win the ball please . Ur vids are awsome. Subbed :)
ZONEofTECH I have the Note 3 and my shit never ever works. Been in the tutorial it never works. Glad it just isnt me.
ZONEofTECH These pictures look like an iPod touch with a white case on it
ZONEofTECH So I can get the cheap version and replace the shell with the current iPhone 5 shell?
ZONEofTECH Hmm, not that far away to be honest. Ukraine is the only country separating us (that sounded really weird hahha). Im glad you like my videos! Dont forget to like,share (all that good stuff....) and SUBSCRIBE to my channel for more EPIC videos ! :D
ZONEofTECH I think that ur an android user and want that people think that apple users are dat ideots like you play the roll

ZONEofTECH I was just about to say this to. But not in this nice of a way if you know what I mean.
ZONEofTECH :) Once again, off camera it actually lags pretty bad. But then again, I am a perfectionist and want everything to be lagfree. Anyway, this is only the BETA 1. Until the final release (which will be in September), we will most likely see at least 34 more BETA versions which will greatly improve performance. Cheers Epix :)
ZONEofTECH Hahah CONGRATULATIONS BRYAN!!!!!! I hope you found my videos useful :) Be sure to LIKE, SHARE the videos so more people can see them and SUBSCRIBE to my channel (if you havent already done so), for more EPIC videos :D Cheers Bryan and congratulations again for being the 1st :D!

ZONEofTECH apple was before microsoft. Gates worked in Apple
ZONEofTECH Step up your game Xbox
ZONEofTECH Your channel is great dude! I think you deserve more than 7,000 subscribers
ZONEofTECH how did you create a second account ? itunes asks for a credit card linked to a us address
ZONEofTECH It is :) The only difference between the 2, being that iRadioiTunes Radios ads are only 515s long (so yes, they are a lot shorter). I hope you found my videos useful :) Be sure to LIKE, SHARE the videos so more people can see them and SUBSCRIBE to my channel (if you havent already done so), for more EPIC videos :D Cheers Kyle :)

ZONEofTECH I tried literally everything, every youtube video, downloaded 4 different programs, deleted my adblock, called ATT, looked on every forum The only thing that worked was PUTTING MY iPHONE 4S IN THE FREEZER. I just did it as a joke  last resort because I was literally about to go to the apple store and buy a new phone but I put it in for like 20 or 30 minutes and it worked lol I will make a video on it if I have to. Im not joking at all. Someone else try and tell me if it works
ZONEofTECH didnt work please dont do this
ZONEofTECH upgrade your itunes to 11.0.4 and it would be done
ZONEofTECH hallo and thank you i have mistake nr 16 by itune wha i sould do my eamil is  carloharbhotmail.com

ZONEofTECH i downloaded iPhone 4 (GSM) (LINK) ios7 beta5 , is it working with out developer ac...?
ZONEofTECH Its stupid to try to get BETA 1 now when Apple is coming out with the official version in like 2 or 3 weeks. If you were going to get BETA 1, you guys should have done this a long time ago.
ZONEofTECH please respond i never had ios 7 beta is ok if i skip and go straight to ios 7 beta 6??
ZONEofTECH it says not compatible with this device
ZONEofTECH i dont think it works for I phone 4 cause It says its incompatible and if u know how to install it to I phone 4 pls help me ZONEofTECH and do u know how to install it using NEC computer

ZONEofTECH 2hrs :) .. i think they limit the download speed on mega.. yesterday 160kbps down is the max i hit.. even my connection is 5MBs on download..
ZONEofTECH Can you change the artist pictures?
ZONEofTECH FCKING IDOITS REMOVING COVERFLOW!! GRRRRR!!!!
ZONEofTECH Thats the Biggest attraction Ive ever know about Apples application! I love it!
ZONEofTECH Just make a US itunes account if you want to use it and your outside of the US
ZONEofTECH The cooling tech looks quite awesome, they can actually cut alot of cost from there, but the design is ugly on the outside hmmmm
ZONEofTECH Multiboard with a big central heatsink.
ZONEofTECH WOAH APPLE TRASH BIN PRO!
ZONEofTECH this most be on iphone 4S
ZONEofTECH OMG that is fuing ridiculous. Its like comparing infrared with wifi... BTW sending data via bluetooth or wifi exists way longer than any mobile apple device does. COME ON. You need a fuing JAILBREAK to actually send data via bluetooth with an iPhone or iPod...how retarded is that?!?
ZONEofTECH Airdrop is not useful, it obvious need wifi connection If you dont have it, it is useless And NFC can send things across Android and new windows tablets
ZONEofTECH Fuck theres so many geeks in that front row I cant breathe p.s how is this different from Bluetooth and just sending a pic iphone to Iphone? I feel like this is just really simple and I should be more impressed?
ZONEofTECH AirDrop DOES NOT need WiFi
ZONEofTECH You say a network is created between the phones. What protocol do you assume it uses? As far as I know, from owning a Mac, AirDrop works over WiFi. That network created is based on WiFi. What makes AirDrop easier to use is that the user doesnt have to manually set up that WiFi network. Once the user turns on AirDrop, hisher device is visible to any other device with AirDrop activated. Hope that clarifies things. :) Look up Wikipedia, too, for more info.
ZONEofTECH You understood it wrong. AirDrop doesnt need a third party WiFi network. It uses WiFi and Bluetooth. Actually, its pretty similar to AirBlue Sharing, except that AirBlue Sharing allows sendingreceiving to and from noniOS devices. Come to think of it, its the exact same thing :
ZONEofTECH how do i delete the favorites?
ZONEofTECH Yeah i wanna know too!!
ZONEofTECH Wow. WebOS card multitasking.
ZONEofTECH I dont have siri on my ipad 2.. What should i do?
ZONEofTECH I REAAALLY want them to have an option between the original and the two new voices of Siri. Sometimes I likeit to be classy with the original voice too, but like to have the new ones too
ZONEofTECH My cousin John Magpantay is working with IOS in the car
ZONEofTECH toll das gab es alles schon
ZONEofTECH It came out mine says 11 hours and iPad 9 hours
ZONEofTECH By this, do you mean the video or the giveaway? Both are international :)
ZONEofTECH Id touch that Ipodtouch and I would like it love your videos and also play league of legends
ZONEofTECH no really about the camera app
ZONEofTECH wow thanks D P.S great vid!
ZONEofTECH anyone else have bad mouse issues when playing on a mac?
ZONEofTECH But it has shit dpwn already!!!!
ZONEofTECH i have that smae problem
ZONEofTECH How long did you update it?
ZONEofTECH Neva used batteries for xbox 360 jus rechargeable
ZONEofTECH Hope bf4 is optimized for this. the heli, heart beat, cars and tanks, guns, ext
ZONEofTECH Nope .. it comes with rechargeable triple A batteries that can be replaced at any time. (ps this time you also get a cable that will charge your controller while you play with it, or you can just use that if your out of batteries for some reason)
ZONEofTECH How could you tell :)?
ZONEofTECH There both mid to high end pcs actually.
ZONEofTECH it still doesnt exist :P
ZONEofTECH Congratulations to the winner!!
ZONEofTECH If they add live wallpapers, that would be amazing!
ZONEofTECH the first is the best and totally new OS :) Love it.
ZONEofTECH Countdown to WWDC Use this great app to help you Countdown to WWDC 2013! Just search Countdown to WWDC on the App Store!
ZONEofTECH Its a concept...all of them are...READ the title.
ZONEofTECH I think 1 is the best one. Actually 5 is good but if Apple want to be the best of the best than Android just please dont use that 5. Thanks
ZONEofTECH Philips concept is so AWSOEME!
ZONEofTECH The number one by Philip Joyce and number four by Kerroudj were the two best. If they can integrate both of them in the next IOS I will be very happy.
ZONEofTECH Are you getting the ps4?
ZONEofTECH ,,nice music...who is it by?,,
ZONEofTECH Its called the iPhone 5c
ZONEofTECH 300 is about 200 so thats good for me
ZONEofTECH Hello Guys  Ladies. Lets not get too carried away. Apple or Samsung, they are my best smartphones on planet earth. I love them all. Thanks Apple. Thanks Samsung. Keep up and go to the next level. Thanks Tech.
ZONEofTECH TheDarkMiner1 300 may be the unsubsidized full retail price. Look closely. An iPhone 5 full retail at Verizon starts at 649.99
ZONEofTECH You Itards are hilarious! LMFAO!
ZONEofTECH I might get it for comparison to iPhone 5
ZONEofTECH Shouldnt they be able to put more pixels in a screen that big?
ZONEofTECH Im planning to get the s4 on a two year contract, after that I will probably get a mega.
ZONEofTECH Samsung galaxy s3 doesnt have iCloud? SO WHAT? That is not fail of device
ZONEofTECH yeah..i mean my main problem is transfering games and apps to sd card...there isnt an option for that..and it s a bit complicated to do it with some other way....only 4 gb inside and got a 16 gb card and can t use it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.......only problem faced so far !
ZONEofTECH your EPIC man, and ya know what, you have the best vs and review videos EVER
ZONEofTECH Ill get a s3 mini its good to know that Ill love it :)
ZONEofTECH which adaptor is needed for the mini?
ZONEofTECH Saving up to get the Samsung galaxy s3 mini!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH Thanks a lot man for asking my questions ! but i have one more.. what about the size of s4 mini? because i dont want to have a large phone , as i think tablets have that role and i need smth to fit in my pocket .. so if its gonna be pretty big i ll definitely get the s3 mini !
ZONEofTECH and optimalizacion on iphone ???
ZONEofTECH wheres the 8th part? thank you :)
ZONEofTECH s3 mini is worse BUT I LOVE IT
ZONEofTECH Ive got s3 mini. Best phone Ive ever had. I had iPhone 4 before. Kinda wish still had it cause of IOS 7. s3 mini much better experience though
ZONEofTECH ZONEofTECH:Im a 12 year old what should I buy not beacuase of price?
ZONEofTECH The temple run test was slightly unfair as you could tell the s3 mini had not run temple run before but the iPhone had
ZONEofTECH You cant compair one game iniciated (iphone) with one never played (s3 mini)
ZONEofTECH S3 mini has a bettet Mike than the Iphone 4S
ZONEofTECH 4S Is Better You Are Fuckin Crazyy
ZONEofTECH Son of a bich you hate the s3 mini
ZONEofTECH iPhone 4 or S3 mini? (Notice I asked for iPhone 4, not 4s)
ZONEofTECH Watching from s3 mini...wanna get 4s too ..cool phones
ZONEofTECH Is it possible to have multiwindow on this phone?
ZONEofTECH hey the s3 has the camera in the middle with the speaker on the left hand side and the flash on the right hand side for your information....
ZONEofTECH Yes, I have.Ive even made a video of it. Actually, I have an entire series called EPIC BATTLES: S3 Mini vs iPhone 4S, in which I cover every aspect of the 2 phones. Check it out: main episode: youtube.comwatch?vPghxzJE5eg Click on a thumbnail in the main episode to see a specific part of the battle, such as GAMING, PRICE, CAMERA and so on. Cheers Izak80! :)
ZONEofTECH It doesnt matter what model you get you cant save apps onto the sd card your stuck with apps on the phones external memory it pointless having an sd card slot when you not allowed to save apps and games to it
ZONEofTECH its not Pentile Matrix ist RGB matrix
ZONEofTECH TouchWiz is so fucking horrible. It made me learn how to root and flash my S3. Damn you touchwiz, you turned me into flash junkie. d2att.zip FTW!!
ZONEofTECH Even s3 is better than the iphone 5
ZONEofTECH Samsung always gonna be on top
ZONEofTECH But why it got to be so big? Lol I love everything else.
ZONEofTECH will it have a adobe flash player
ZONEofTECH will it have a adobe flash player
ZONEofTECH Yes Im getting one and yes its better than an iPhone
ZONEofTECH what amazing this phone OMG i love Apple but sorry Apple samsung did something is better
ZONEofTECH It has a real nice features and very easy to use but its ugly , I dont like the shape of that phone and its too big !!
ZONEofTECH Smart Pause???????? HTC ONE has a full hd Super LCD3 capacitive touchscreen with 469ppi pixel density whereas GS4 has a super amoled screen with 441 ppi pixell density ... so neither GS4 has the best screen in the market nor HTC One .. It varies frm person to person
ZONEofTECH 1000 out of 1020 comments here are just spam robots spamming with slutty comments xD
ZONEofTECH i hope s4 improve the battery life because s3 drain fast the battery
ZONEofTECH Im getting this awesome smarphone ever..
ZONEofTECH How wrong could you get.... I mean really.
ZONEofTECH This video was made A WEEK BEFORE the Galaxy S was even announced. Everything was just rumours and I WAS 99 right, except for the design. All the specs turned up to be the SAME as the ones in the video. For the FINAL specs and TOP 10 FEATURES, check out my latest video, which covers everything on the new Galaxy S4.
ZONEofTECH iphone killer!! yay!!
ZONEofTECH Legit, effectively it has two quad cores but for marketing purposes they are calling it an Octocore. The processes have different functions on the phone, one quad core processor preforms all the active processes while the other one preforms all the background processes.
ZONEofTECH And apple falls behind in tjis amazing would he ever make it to the finish...?
ZONEofTECH Stupid little girl trying to steal my galaxy s4
ZONEofTECH simply the best game ever add me via game centre peeps lcam80
ZONEofTECH Really? :) Well Im not :) Anyway, thanks (I think).
ZONEofTECH Graphics look amazing, but the AI appear to be dumb as shit. Multiple times the character just walks past enemies with no reaction at all from them. Graphics are good, but dont gorget about the other stuff (AI, animations, story, gameplay, etc...)
ZONEofTECH xbox 360 could do this right now
ZONEofTECH Assassins zone liberation
ZONEofTECH It will defiantly have a gyroscope and a FaceTime camera. Apple prompted everyone else with the nano to make smart watches
ZONEofTECH I think that I would look cool
ZONEofTECH its going to look like the pic you have when you mentioned the pulse rate thing and mate i really hop this comes out so excited :D :D :D
ZONEofTECH Going to be awesome and look amazing ...
ZONEofTECH that looks really nice  cool too. maybe you could video chat on it like that dick tracy watch :P
ZONEofTECH I highly doubt theyd integrate anything like this... Am I the only one who realizes they have already manufactured waterproof datapower ports...?
ZONEofTECH maybe the charging is done by the gyroscope that is inside the watch...they all ready have made that kind of watches, my dad has one of these....
ZONEofTECH Often times the engineers release blueprints or even parts of products before they are announced for a hefty bit of cash on the side. Thats how they knew so much about the iPhone 5 before its announcement for example.
ZONEofTECH Probably a little like the 3 but more curves and it will still use the XMB but updated kinda like how IOS updates stuff.
ZONEofTECH it says im missing iTunesMobileDevice.dll how do i get this
ZONEofTECH For everybody using RecBoot on PC, extract all the files into your desktop and put them in a folder together name the folder RecBoot, then after they are all in the folder rightclick the application recboot and click run as administrator. This should remove any problems.
ZONEofTECH It just worked for me. Thank you loads.
ZONEofTECH OK GUYS I GOT IT TO WORK. RECBOOT DIDNT WORK FOR ME SO I FREAKED OUT. TALKED TO APPLE EXPERT AND THEY TOLD ME TO HOLD HOME AND LOCKPOWER BUTTON UNTIL IT TURNS ON. IT WORKED :) HOPE THIS HELPS!
ZONEofTECH my bootcamp doesnt look like that..
ZONEofTECH Im going to get wind 8
ZONEofTECH I have free disk space 29 gigabytes, will it be enough?
ZONEofTECH what about OX Mavericks
ZONEofTECH I have this Problem when trying to install windows on my mac.Cant install the software because it is not currently available from the Software Update server.what can I do?
ZONEofTECH Yes I plane on buying windows 8.1 to put on my Mac ProSo can use my Dj software
ZONEofTECH can you download games for windows with this??
ZONEofTECH hey, if i install windows, can i have both, mac and windows?
ZONEofTECH Hi Zone of Tech: I need help :) I been working on installing windows 8 on my Mac. Spec of equipment:Mac Book Pro Mid 2012 Bootcamp Version: Version 5.0.4 (473) Bootable USB Flash Drive: Type Scan disk 4 GB windows 8 pro iso image but without the driver and the 2nd Scan disk USB flash drive with 32 GB with the Bootcamp Drivers downloaded and saved to this drive. Please Note: I also have the original back up installation disc for Microsoft 8 Prof 64 from Microsoft where I purchased it from. 1st Bootcamp is not recognizing the Original Microsoft 8 Pro backup disk from microsoft itself. Solution: I created the New Image from the Original Microsoft installed disc in my desk top and changed the extension to .ISO then burned the ISO image into the newly purchased DVDR. Then I ran Bootcamp Once again and it get the following error message The installer disc could not be found  Insert your Windows installer disc and wait a few seconds for the disc to be recognized. Solution 2: Created a bootable usb drive with bootcamp assistant successfully with bootcamp. Yes I close, ejected or unmounted any image that was open or had been previously used then i restarted the Mac. Next, I start the bootcamp assistant tool once again then i get the same insert your windows installer disc message. 3: Then I try to resolve the installer disc not found issue: this are the steps i took: a). Lauch disc utilities   1. Selected the top most drive 750 GB Macintosh HDD   2. On the right youll see 5 tab buttons: First Aid  Erase  Partition  RAID  Restore.   3. Choose Partition. Then I clicked  to add another partition size of the partition was 222 GB   4. Change the Name of the Partition to BOOTCAMP   5. Change the Format to MSDOS (FAT)   6. Click Apply to save the changes and then reboot your Mac and well begin Windows installation.   7. During reboot, press and hold the altOption key and youll be presented with drives to boot from.   8. Use the arrow keys and return button to select the Windows yellow USB key drive containing your Windows 8 installation files.   9. This will begin the Windows install.  then i get the following message: Booting from Boot Camp Assistant created USB Drive...Failed to load BOOTMGR.4: Take the Mac to best buy and let them resolve the issue and charge me like a million dollars for it :( since i have no other idea who to get this bootcamp working at all. This has been a terribly lengthy issue and it is not as simple as it is claimed to be since i started with the Original Windows Disc Purchased from Microsoft and I have the Optical disc drive which it should be simpler from what I understand. Please can you help It would be of great help. :)my email is jramirez0801yahoo.com

ZONEofTECH I want to win because i have on my pc windows xp,and i want to make an upgrade to windows 8. Thanks.
ZONEofTECH Doese it make an difference if its a retina or a nonretina macbook? Some programs is shown in a really bad quality because the program is not made for retina, so i wonder if windows 8 will be shown in a bad quality or just default normal quality.
ZONEofTECH where can i download windows 8 .iso file?
ZONEofTECH Which OS am I not using? Hi5!

ZONEofTECH Also, way to NOT manage the levels in your review. I turn up the volume to hear the commentary and every time you play a song, it blows my eardrums out while Im listening on headphones.
ZONEofTECH Did you watch the entire 17min video to answer the QODV or did you read it in the description box :D? Im just curious because I think the video is way too long for someone to watch. Cheers!
ZONEofTECH at 4:53, you said apps. I dont have it on my list there, I only have 4 listed there. I forgot what it was but I just know I dont have it. Plz help me!
ZONEofTECH f . king bu shitt damnit wtf i change to Android

ZONEofTECH I may consider getting a pc this generation
ZONEofTECH This time do not put laser burning or when theres a disk inside the xbox and you lift and it gets screwed up
ZONEofTECH I think someone has left a piece of there bullshit behind
ZONEofTECH wouldnt it be awesome if it had a projector built in it
ZONEofTECH This guy didnt answer my question maybe someone here can... Ok does anyone know if the new Xbox will be backwards compatible with Xbox 360 games!?
ZONEofTECH Why did he say that the next Xbox will be 300 dollars, the same as the current one when the current one only costs 200 dollars. Unless he is talking about Kinect included.
ZONEofTECH No, I was talking about the standard edition. Unfortunately it is going to be a bit more expensive at the start, since the new hardware will be more expensive than to old one, to manufacture. Same happened with the PS3 in 2006. But the price will drop after a while, thrust me. By the way, please SUBSCRIBE to my channel if you enjoyed my video :) Cheers! :D
ZONEofTECH My pc sucks. All that porn spyware AM I RIGHT?
ZONEofTECH Why would it have 8gig of ram? I dont see a need as it will proberly be running a hybrid Windows 8 RT.
ZONEofTECH OK , now show us how to play diablo 3 for free to 60 lvl :D

ZONEofTECH google now on ios is only for web it cant control ios related apps
ZONEofTECH Pretty annoying that you dont explain that Flutter uses your WEBCAM to control your mac. It has nothing to do with kincet, its just motion control of your mac with builtin webcam
ZONEofTECH Do you know when itll be available for shipping?
ZONEofTECH sad, i just got my iMac 2 days ago :(
ZONEofTECH 1) Please dont support apple. Optical drive is a essential maybe 10 years after this people might not use it but people use it to play movies, games and music cds what about to reinstall Mac or install Windows on Boot camp you will have to pay 100 or so to buy a optical drive. Apple is doing that so they can make extra money by selling other things with the computer. 2) Computers can input video i have my PS3 connected to my iMac with a mini display to HDMI adapter.
ZONEofTECH very helpful review. thanks!
ZONEofTECH This isnt the iPhone 5.,..
ZONEofTECH Next time ask for the standing bro, ahahahaha !
ZONEofTECH jajajajjajajajaj que chimba esa tegnologia
ZONEofTECH Thanks a bunch for this video. Planning on starting Videos on Youtube. But wanted to know what Youtube would pay for the partnership. Appreciated the video :)
ZONEofTECH You guys should check out this EXTRAORDINARY website called ZONEPA.COM . You can make money online and start working from home today as I am! I am making over 3,000 per month at ZONEPA.COM ! Visit Zonepa.com and check it out! Why does the faded opinion schedule the support? When does the fearful machine sample the measure? How does the hope transport the violent wash?
ZONEofTECH yeah :( :,( ahh man he makes it so much better
ZONEofTECH Actually there has been. Back in the olden days when the iphone 3g was the newer model, the ipod touch 2g was released and by all accounts was technically superior. Just google ipod touch 2g vs iphone 3g or take a look at their geekbench scores.
ZONEofTECH I have the third generation and drooling over this
ZONEofTECH frisat?? u had no idea what u were talkin abt.. :p
ZONEofTECH can we use navigation on this one?
ZONEofTECH FK i just bought a new ipod a week ago!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH I think i broken my ipod 4 and buy this one
ZONEofTECH blue imma getting it in blue when the 8gb comes out. i cant wait for siri. new friend
ZONEofTECH Nope, u still will get the same ipod (iPod Touch 4G)... lol why would u break it? just sell it then buy ipod 5g using that money. :)
ZONEofTECH Apple is going to be sued haha
ZONEofTECH Yup, its true. At first Apple copied the UI from Xerox and made it a lot better. One of their biggest inventions was the capacitive multitouch screen, together with the amazing design of their products.
ZONEofTECH Why doesn anyone bother making dribble like this? Rehash the same nonsense arguments? If you like iphone buy iphone if you like samsung buy samsung this nonsense only increases the pay checks of lawyers. Apple is JUST a brand looking for profit get over it . PS : to show you why this is dribble just look up th lg prada or any of the other smartphones designed during that period, seem familiar?
ZONEofTECH Samsung is piece of shit, its all apples ideas. Those lazy ass workers just stoled it. Its like apple are competiting with another apple.
ZONEofTECH Sony didnt have ultrabooks before the air...take a look moron sony x505 dated 2004. Apple copied that idiot.
ZONEofTECH i love it very much,its my childhood
ZONEofTECH You sir, are correct.
ZONEofTECH No disrespect but you sound like Stephan Hawking mate!
ZONEofTECH next time show whats on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ZONEofTECH you already opened it and set it up.i know why you did that one you want to save time two maybe you used it and put it back in the box
ZONEofTECH haha looks like a not original front glass anyway great video sub
ZONEofTECH Lai cumparat din Romania nu?
ZONEofTECH liiiiike for the old memories
ZONEofTECH the phone is in romanian ? wtf
ZONEofTECH Assassins Creed background music. Lol
ZONEofTECH Mate u just dont no anything
ZONEofTECH what a waste of bandwidth
ZONEofTECH Try doing this and restarting your computer multiple times rather than just once. I havenr tried it on the 840 series but it might not work since the Trim Enabler software needs to be updated for the new SSD and Im not sure it has been updated.
ZONEofTECH Ok, thanks for the advice, I probably will. Anyway, please SUBSCRIBE to my channel if you enjoyed me content :D and also sharing this video will be great so more people can see it. Thanks a lot Clark!
ZONEofTECH under about this mac and system report i dont have anything that says trim support. Why is that?
ZONEofTECH yes, you can. I dont know about ONYX but CCleaner works fine.
ZONEofTECH lol for a second i thought it was a black mat
ZONEofTECH You can also eject the SIM card by using a paper clip.
ZONEofTECH If its the iphone 3, how d
ZONEofTECH i cant,tell me and i subscribe and...ur romanian?if yes mai ai telefonul si cu cat il vinzi?
ZONEofTECH They give you a cleaning cloth? LUCKY!
ZONEofTECH THANKS FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO I RALLY NEED TO FIND AN ONBOXING OF IPHONE 3G AND U GAVE IT TO ME. THANKS
ZONEofTECH Its amazing 810. (8 and not 10 because of the screen. The iPad 3 or 4 is much better due to the retina display so try and get that one) iTunes DOES NOT cause any viruses.... (parents :D ). iTunes is just for syncing your iPad to you computer (transferring music, videos apps and so on). But you dont have to use it if you dont want to. iCloud is just for mail,contacts,notes,apps and photos, not music or videos. I hope that I was clear enough. Cheers :D and please SUBSCRIBE if you enjoyed!
ZONEofTECH Thx :D Please be sure to SHARE this video on FaceBook and Twitter, because I have put a lot of effort in making this video and unfortunatelly it doesnt have as many views as it deserves. Thank you! :D Also please SUBSCRIBE to my channel if you enjoyed my content Cheers and thank you for your support :D !
ZONEofTECH Yes, it will make it faster, but you MacBook only has SATA 1 which means that the max speed will be about 100mbs read, instead of 500 which I am getting now. So no, the difference will not be huge. Also, TRIM is worth enabling. Check out my TRIM enable video. Also please SUBSCRIBE to support me :) Thx:D
ZONEofTECH Do SSDs have a lifespan? I vaguely remember hearing they are good for 5 years. We have to replace them every 5 years or so.
ZONEofTECH WTF, I thought he meant the fruit...grape. Sick people...sick people everywhere...
ZONEofTECH Hello Zoneoftech should i ditch my Macbook pro 13 2011 stock for an Macbook air 13 haswell?
ZONEofTECH Sure and thanks for the rapid response. I just bought a brand new 2012 15 MBP 2.3GHz 500 GB Apple HDD last week. I have absolutely nothing on it in terms of dataor anything. I have been purposely waiting unitl I can put the SSD in to put any softwaredataetc. on it. I also have an 128GB Samsung 830 SSD. I am going to put he SSD in the HDD place and the HDD in the opti bay. So, what I want to do is have my OS on and boot from the SSD.
ZONEofTECH This seriously made a HUGE improvement on my macbook pro. Is completely as good as advertised and this video made it all too easy for a rookie to do!!
ZONEofTECH I just brought a use one this style ipod didnt know it was this old I guess should did research I pay way to much for it...
ZONEofTECH this was also my first ever apple product, I got it when it was first released when I was 9 :L i still have it, its the 8gb blue version. I have since gotten the apple iPad 2 (white, 32gb , wifi model) , the 5th gen iPod nano (blue, 8gb ) and I recently just got the 5th gen iPod touch (silver Nd white 64gb version.) Im soon hoping to add a iPhone 5 or maybe even the 4s to my apple collection :D
ZONEofTECH Yeah, good old times. Be sure to subscribe if you liked this video, like it, even favorite it if you want. Ill be posting over 30 videos in the upcoming days, all of them filmed in 1080p. It would help me a lot, since at the moment I do not have so many subscribers, nor views. Thank you
ZONEofTECH Does this support 17.3 inch laptops?
ZONEofTECH I have a Sony vaio VPCCW26FA (14) would you recommend it?
ZONEofTECH Thx :D be sure to SUBSCRIBE to my channel as well, if you enjoyed my content :D Cheers ! :)
ZONEofTECH just shared this a bunch . i hope u get more views ure good
TopGear New connected car standards put Europe into top gearImagine that you are driving along, and a message is projected on your windscreen, warning you of an accident that has just happened around the next corner. This could soon be a reality thanks to new European standards. Connected cars, able to communicate with each other and with road infrastructures, are expected to appear on European roads in 2015.Two European standards organisations, ETSI and CEN, confirmed today that the basic set of standards requested by the European Commission to make connected cars a reality has been fully completed. The norms which they have adopted ensure that vehicles made by different manufacturers can communicate with each other.The EU invested more than 180 million in research projects on cooperative transport systems, whose results helped develop the standards. This will put the European car industry, which provides 13 million jobs, out in front in the race to develop the next generation of cars.http:europa.eurapidpressreleaseIP14141en.pdf

screenjunkies initially by making fun of him you are promoting videos
screenjunkies The title is just epic!
screenjunkies Nah, this was just a onetime thing. Ill stick to reading the scripts for Screenjunkies.
screenjunkies Now Im starting to wonder, where is that Avengers stop motion?

screenjunkies faz todos os outros hahah
screenjunkies Eu at que gostei do filme, mas no mostrou nada alm do desenho.
screenjunkies WHY WAS SIGNS MORE HATED THAN AFTER EARTH?
screenjunkies The Internship... its a poor excuse for a google advert, calling it a movie would be a huge overstatement. And it makes no sense.Vince Vaughn needs to teach the good nerds how to live. Interestingly this is also the only major difference between the good nerds and the bad nerd.The advert teaches you, that nerds can be either disgusting and geeky, or evil. Nothing else makes sense, but this is almost offensive to me.
screenjunkies I think he was most annoyed when you yanked on his hair. That was hilarious!!!
screenjunkies God, this interview cringes me.
screenjunkies Easily the Aniston part
screenjunkies Your so money by the way
screenjunkies VInce no likee interview
screenjunkies Happy Birthday, Joe! I hope everyone is nice to you this evening.
screenjunkies I understood basically all of the technical jargon in this video just by playing War Thunder.
screenjunkies Depends what are they doing?? Arm wrestling definitely Vin Diesel but wrestling would be the rock
screenjunkies A Scion xb drift? The real answer is no not without a drive train swap. Fwd cars dont drift, they power slide.
screenjunkies Yo, fuck you, hes great.
screenjunkies I always thought it was pancakes.
screenjunkies Is he your boyfriend?
screenjunkies NW independent german auto repairs represented by Latino guy with Hitler mustash or so :) u wouldnt believe but my PC soundcard broke down on it with downsampling from 41. khz to like 800Hz...
screenjunkies Vin because he has a big ass vein on his head when he fights the rock
screenjunkies BIG FACEPALMNO NO and NO again no fucking next generation crap!That show ruined the franchise!Pickard was a complete wimp and Worf was fun but there was way too much klingon bullshit!The only truly original character was Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg).And for every new series they made the more screwed up the entire story got!The reboot movies were good but they did make them AU for a reason!!!
screenjunkies I try to take an objective side in debates like this. But this guy, this first guy on the far left in the red shirt.My initial thoughts when I heard Reboot TNG were: Just dont.Then after that when I was hearing the reasons and characters: 0:51 to 1:10 I just wanted to staple the guys mouth shut.I havent seen breaking bad, Ive got a long list of stuff to watch, but from what that guy says, this Heisenberg is nowhere near what JeanLuc Picard is as a character. Maybe its my inner Trekkie, but from the moment he started talking I could just feel the rage bubbling up from my gut. It wasnt the bad rage, it was the passionate rage. I love TNG, I just dont want it to become something that its not. Im midway through a Tolkien movie crisis because the Hobbit films are pretty much shitting on my hopes at the moment. (Maybe this is how the star wars diehards feel)
screenjunkies Im sorry but I cant see anyone else playing PicardPatrick Stewart is the ONE AND ONLY Picard!
screenjunkies Personally, I think Cranston is too old to play Picard, Picard was younger when he first started.
screenjunkies The idea of rebooting TNG is terrifying, especially if its done as terribly as TOS. Neither series needed or needs rebooting, they are perfectly fine as they are. The Abrams movies are basically hollowed out, poorly written, and soulless shells of what Star Trek was, is, and should always be. Whoever wrote these abominations either had never watched Star Trek, or any of the meaning went right over their heads. DO NOT REBOOT TNG, EVER. Youve already fucked over pretty much every other Scifi series that was good, go mess up Star Wars and leave Trek alone.
screenjunkies Star trek will never ever again be star trek, The star trek that us real fans know and love sadly will not sell to the simple minded majority who are looking for pretty explosions, over the top fight scenes, drama, and sex appeal. Anything with the name star trek in the future will be made for those with the idiocracy mindset.
screenjunkies What a shitty beam out.
screenjunkies Ralph Fiennes  Captain JeanLuc PicardMichael Fassbender  William T.

screenjunkies hopefully jj has a tragic accident that makes him realise that he absolutely sucks. and has a revelation that makes him stop making film all together
screenjunkies DontBackZach Hah! Sign me up.Indie GoGo: http:igg.meatdontbackzachScreenJunkies ZachBraff Kickstarter
screenjunkies Cant tell if trolling. . .or just trolling.
screenjunkies Youre obviously a manipulative prick. You referred to yourself as an underdog, and you have obviously found the means to attempting to tear down something somebody SUCCESSFUL created, because their creations actually got them somewhere. Youre a dick raging at a camera trying to ruin somebody elses creation. Second off, you clearly havent looked into this NEARLY as much as you should have. Youre sharing your opinion as fact, and factual evidence is virtually completely absent.
screenjunkies Why so many dislikes lol
screenjunkies Why so many dislikes lol
screenjunkies It someone forcing you to back him on Kickstarter? I dont get it, if you dont like it, dont give him money... why is there even a controversy? How does it really effect your life if anyone starts a Glitter 2 Kickstarter? Just ignore it and move on with your day.
screenjunkies Agreed my Jewish friend.
screenjunkies No one is going to give you money we all only subscribe for honest trailers. Yeah Zak is a stupid bitch but no one cares
screenjunkies Even if he makes the movie.....who is going to go see it? Zach Braff fans?? Crickets....frogs.... Exactly. Then who cares???? Stop wasting our time with this (possibly fake, and if it is, its COMPLETELY unfunny) complaining crap.
screenjunkies Look hes making butt flaps!
screenjunkies This movie is pretty freaky
screenjunkies That is the most grossest movie ever
screenjunkies man that movie made me throw up
screenjunkies Game of Thrones is definitely the most awkward show I watch with my mother. I would think the reasons why it would be awkward would be quite obvious
screenjunkies I watched crank with my mom....fucking awkward as hell.
screenjunkies Oh god I lived it again...
screenjunkies That Schmoesknow dude is wearing a Godzilla shirt. KUDOS
screenjunkies Pacific Rim is awesome!
screenjunkies Man of Steel, Ironman 3, The Wolverine, Pacific Rim, Monsters Unversity, and Despicable Me 2. Sorry, I only had six. I need to watch more movies then!
screenjunkies Wow Devin faragi you say the most hilarious things  iron man 3 is what people want from a marvel movie star trek is garbage and not a popular franchise winny wolverine emo peter is perfect im ROTFL!!!!!
screenjunkies Iron Man 3 sucked all kinds of ass in my opinion
screenjunkies Iron man 3 is topMovie
screenjunkies actual order 1) Iron Man 3 409 mil 2) Despicable me 362 mil 3) Man of Steel 291 mil 4) Monsters University 266 mil 5) Fast and the Furious 6 238 mil 6) Oz the great and Powerful 234 mil 7) Star Trek Into the Darkness 228 mil 8) World War Z 202 mil 9) The Croods 187 mil 10) The Heat 159 mil
screenjunkies Fast 6: oh you thought I wasnt gonna do well in box office? FUCK YOUR FACTS
screenjunkies I love pacific rim !!! Like I loved CLoud Atlas ! PR is visualy PERFECT (for 2013) ! Cloud Atlas has a deep theme with what is called the chaos theory !!! They are underated but i dont care, I love them ! ( sorry for bad english, french here)
screenjunkies You gotta do more Superfans meet (Actor)
screenjunkies jackie chan!!! i would flip out if i met him!!!and i would ask questions that no other western interviewer have asked....like how many bones have u broken? show us a punch....show us a kickwhats the worst injury u had?? blah blah
screenjunkies Id blubber like a baby if I ever met Bryan Cranston.
screenjunkies someone needs to link this to the Rock. XD
screenjunkies I smell what the rock was cooking
screenjunkies I SMELL WHAT THE ROCK WAS COOKING!
screenjunkies For me it would be Hugh Jackman because he is the sexiest man I have ever seen and I can say that without being ashamed or anything because thats the thing I just have to be honest about.
screenjunkies check Mark wahlbergs face hahahahhahahahahah
screenjunkies Damn, Marky Mark gave him the shit hand! Is he Muslim by chance?

screenjunkies AEUHUAEHAEUHAEUHAEUHEA AWESOME!
screenjunkies Kkkkk.. muito foda hahha.. as gmeas Olsen. .. esse filme  fodis
screenjunkies 1.hodor2.hodor3.hodor
screenjunkies i hated so much Sansa on the first season!!! but at the end shes not so bad :) Khal Drogo and Tyrion Lanister are my favorite caractor and John Snow is for me the hottest dude in the show! And of course Joffrey is a total bitch.
screenjunkies My least Favorite character is Bron Stark, though he is probably going to a badass motherfucker later currently his scenes are boring and he is just riding around with level 25 pokemon Hodor.
screenjunkies u forgot gindri or whatever roberts bastard
screenjunkies If you read the books then this video would be unessisary and it cersee
screenjunkies how the hell can some of you like Cercei?? in some manner she is worse then idiot king Joffrey...and why is Daenerys annoying? please enlighten me? probably the only character i like and admire besides Tyrion, Arya, Jon and that assassin guy who helped Arya is Daenerys..watch the 1st episode of season 1 and the last and you will see the growth of her character...from being a sister to a guy who would let 40000 men rape her to get his throne to a leader and conqueror...
screenjunkies hottest: the dragons!!coolest: the white walker general!most hated: the mountain! Hes such a mother
screenjunkies His semen made a demon omfg :)
screenjunkies Favourite character: Terian. Hes a little badass dwarf that does whats right and isnt scared of anyone. Most annoying character: Sam. Theres just something about his loveable blunderingness that pisses me off. Most hated: Joffery. Who else would it be? Hes a coward, a spoiled brat, an abusive asshole, and he thinks he can do whatever he wants becuase hes king and no one can stop him.
screenjunkies Hello kitty island adventure fest...
screenjunkies Does anybody knows the name of the spanish guitar song? its awesome, thanks
screenjunkies Why did they bleep God
screenjunkies Game of Thrones related drink....that reference made my day!
screenjunkies just thought of an epic game just really hope no one else posted this.How I Met Your Mother Power Hour. Rules: Play 500 miles By The Proclaimers on a constant loop sipping (or slugging your choice, Im not youre mother) beer on the minute mark and a shot every time the song changes (liquor of your choice i recommend a bitchy type drink cuz its gonna get messy). Do this for an hour. Good Luck... Youre absolutley gonna need it.
screenjunkies That sterio type of irish people getting drunk is partly true like its all younger people getting hammered everyweek i would know cuz am from there :D ps irish people dont sound like that, its like saying all americans have deep voices.... then there is you... )
screenjunkies Dude the goal is to get drunk not end up in the morgue.
screenjunkies in the same way the tooth fairy is a bad word?
screenjunkies Every time Ygritte says You know nothing Jon Snow.
screenjunkies This guy drove me to alcoholism without watching any of the programmes.

screenjunkies Starday as in patriotic stars and starwars, startreck, etc.
screenjunkies It would be comic week my friend, not day, and I would have this huge party with a bunch of comic book movies being played on a large screen, and by playing a lot of card games. Yugioh, Magic, and who knows what else

screenjunkies Do Grave Encounters 1 and 2 !!!
screenjunkies Oh god! The staring hahahaha I cant stop laughing!!!
screenjunkies say who da fuk is this asshole
screenjunkies Twilight is a schizophrenics wet dream  i think the all the films are the fathers delusion since hes probably huffing paint thinner. (I have never seen a twilight film but going by Honest trailers it seems im right)
screenjunkies Oh my god her face is the same is every goddam scene
screenjunkies 3 minutes and 3 seconds of stares are now logged for me. My brain hurts just trying to process all of them....
screenjunkies I cant believe I watched that whole thing. I need to reevaluate the life decisions that have led me to this point.
screenjunkies Could this movie be any greener?
screenjunkies wait a second, so a half hour of these terrible movies are stares?! WHAT THE FCK!!
screenjunkies This is hilarious! I never realized how much of each movie was just stares. XD Lol!
screenjunkies Twilight has a whole minute of stares in each 22,18 minutes of movie. If you cut them off, you can go to the bathroom every 21 minutes. It may be handy for, you know, mental diarrhea.
screenjunkies This baby is monstruously fake. 2014, hello? Cute effect total fail...
screenjunkies this is amazing! haha
screenjunkies Dream Oscar host???definitely Hal Rudnick..
screenjunkies Mel Gibson should host the Oscars...
screenjunkies This is the most creative thing Ive see by you. Pure genius! Btw, Adele also thanked Mr Bean, Roald Dahl, FrenchSaunders and the congestion Charge. It was a pretentious speech (i still love Adele, Shallow Hal)
screenjunkies Apart from you, I would like Jim Carrey to host the shows. Im just saying, to ME, his hilarious!
screenjunkies Thats Barbara Streisand, not Barbara Walters. There is a difference.
screenjunkies Bill hader, Joseph Gordon levitt, or
screenjunkies Oh I see. (The more you know)
screenjunkies XMen: Days of Future Past? more like Wolverine  the Xmen: the live action film.
screenjunkies Batman and howard the duck. Ben Affleck would play howard the duck.
screenjunkies Fuck Deadpool having too long katanas...give that motherfucker a mouth!!!! My favorite part about Deadpool was his flippant attitude about EVERYTHING! Yes, I see the dichotomy between his mouthy human self and this silent mutated one but I want Deadpool to have real katanas, a shit ton of guns and make stupid over the top one liners because thats the Deadpool I know and love.
screenjunkies Heres the thing that bothers me, Wolverine is the lead and main character in this movie. If you know the original comic series of Days of Future Past, you would know that Kitty Pryde aka Shadowcat is the the focus of a majority of the story. Its kind of sexist that she is taking the backseat to Wolverine.
screenjunkies Marc was the only one that answer some good questions the rest suck. I want to see Apocalypse and Cable lead on to what the Avengers marvel franchise is doing.
screenjunkies Have batman team up with the fantastic 4 and xmen with guest apperances from iron man and thor while going against loki the winter soldier and Magneto to try to take all the elemets from the sun to blow up our galaxy
screenjunkies Kitty pryde nightcrawler and invisible woman would make an ultimate stealthy team
screenjunkies Yes, Days of Future Past will suck as much as, or more than, the first three abominations of XMen 13. With those movies the studio opened its ass and dropped a giant duke all over every character in the comics. Just because they stole the name of one of the most beloved Uncanny XMen story arcs does not mean it will be anything but garbage, no matter how anyone tries to convince themselves otherwise.
screenjunkies I call BS on this whole video
screenjunkies Hals reaction to the girl thinking Leia was played by Natalie Portman was priceless.
screenjunkies This girls are IDIOTS! or really nervous.
screenjunkies I have never been out on a date on valentines day, and after watching this video i will make sure i will never do it.
screenjunkies Also those girls need to watch some films, not knowing any of the films Hal was using for scenarios is crazy
screenjunkies Natalie Portman in Empire Strikes Back!?
screenjunkies Uhhh, I was born in 89 and all I know about Gabriel is hes a singer. Obviously I got nearly every other reference.
screenjunkies Did Hal hook up with Hailey for Valentines day?
screenjunkies You may not like it but say it sucks its just being overly infantile
screenjunkies The best half time show they give the money to charity and you entertain yourself during half time.
screenjunkies Why does everyone hate on the host so much?
screenjunkies Best half time show recreate the spongebob half time show (sweet victory) with a guest appearence of morgan freeman
screenjunkies Well until they are, SB36 is on top.
screenjunkies Oh Europe  Just let us have our sport.
screenjunkies Best Halftime Show would be if Morgan Freeman narrated the halftime show while, Johnny Depp barges in with a ship and Tony Stark came in with the Avengers and they would have Battle of DISNEY!
screenjunkies Sure, just take every single persongroup that was in the Sound City movie. And U2.
screenjunkies david attenborough or morgan freeman walks out and just narrates everything that happens or that he sees
screenjunkies The blonde woman has a mind of a 13 year old girl. Where do ppl like that come from?
screenjunkies 1:281:32 Pictured an immediate explosion graphic with Pewdiepie saying Nailed it!
screenjunkies I dont know if I should laugh or cry at those girls. Poor fools.
screenjunkies Dont call wiccans stupid bitches! We dont call christians stupid for believing that having sex before getting a permission slip from the church sends you to hell. So our practices are a little strange. Why should you care? You dont need to do them. The only reason the we dont christians practices are weird is because we are so used to them. So please, try to be a little nicer for once in your life.
screenjunkies Red riding hood wolf slayer or jack the bean slayer
screenjunkies I dont know if it count as a fairy tale. Dr Dolittle baby seal abortionist would sound like a pretty gruesome Disney reboot! What do you think?
screenjunkies Their parking spot spell is just a sentence in Greek, she says please give me a parking spot keep it open for me please... and some of the words are pronounced wrong lol!!!
screenjunkies The redhead witch sure put a spell on me. Made my penis bigger and everything.
screenjunkies Quick question: what the fuck is a real witch?
screenjunkies I might have squealed when Dave Franco showed up...
screenjunkies We should take all the zombie kill suggestions and try them out on the likes of Taylor Lange and gaiassia. How do these people think that this mockumentry is real? Wow. !!! Rob is awesome. Franco is much funnier and talented then his gay older brother.
screenjunkies 3:30 ROFL did he touch u ? nods head take it all off
screenjunkies I am strangely very, very attracted to Rob Corddry... even in zombie makeup. Not to actual zombies, mind. Just Rob Corddry. Is that weird? I feel like that might be a little weird.
screenjunkies Most effective way to kill zombie: punch to bladder.
screenjunkies Bear hug them from behind. 3
screenjunkies If you can fool a child into thinking youre dead and you hate her then youre doing something right.
screenjunkies BANE GAY KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK rachei aki cara
screenjunkies Twilight action figures... very offensive
screenjunkies two girls one cup that shit touched my hart! love
screenjunkies Screen Junkies with a street Junkie. lol.
screenjunkies passion of christ...cross and nails sold separately
screenjunkies How about the Hal Rudnick  Gets Shanked in L.A. action figure? I was really hoping that chick would bury a shiv in his voicebox and take that toy. Im sure hes a great guy in person but MY GOD could a mans voice be any more annoying? I dont wish him dead, I just wish him mute. Does that make me a bad person?
screenjunkies A Schindlers List EasyBakeOven
screenjunkies Saving Private Ryan  Captain Miller Action Figure
screenjunkies kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk show, parabens pela legenda
screenjunkies The Amazing Spiderman deserved to win a Razzie. It was awful, oversimplified, and it even ruined the good Spiderman movies because I now know that Hollywood cant just leave good franchises alone.
screenjunkies How in the frick did After Earth not make every category for the Razzis?
screenjunkies Cloud Atlas was a class film if youre intelligent enough to actually concentrate and appreciate the structures of the story.
screenjunkies Amazing SpiderMan was not remake. It was the first live action SpiderMan movie that actually felt like it was based off the comic books. The Tobey Maguire movies seemed like they were made by someone one vaguely knew who SpiderMan was  maybe read one of the comics once.
screenjunkies Im not defending Amazing Spiderman Im saying it sucked! Gosh dammit! I hated that movie!
screenjunkies I love adam sandlers old stuff, why did he become so shit
screenjunkies 2013 Razzie nominees are out!Oogieloves in the Big ADHD Adventure. Twilight 4.2. Tyler Perry for worst actor and actress. I love these guys!http:www.razzies.com
screenjunkies Battleship couldve been a Really Great movie, if it had a better director, better script, and better actors along with better visual effects! It couldve very well been a landmark blockbuster such as Jurassic Park, Terminator 2, Aliens, Independence Day, Avatar, etc!
screenjunkies Die Hard 5...the biggest Mercedes advert ever.
screenjunkies JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE HARD
screenjunkies Bruce Willis has been bored since With A Vengeance. Hes become a paycheck chaser
screenjunkies Die hard 5 was one of the worst films I ever saw
screenjunkies What was with the fake hand and then never referencing it? Great show though. My new years resolution is to do more actual work at the office. Got to sign off now!
screenjunkies That fat ass is fucking screaming his ass off, calm the fuck down
screenjunkies i wasnt sure until now, but you are fucking with me. congrats you had me going for a while
screenjunkies The Last Stand was good in the fix ur referring
screenjunkies just because there were gun fights and explosions doesnt mean its a fun movie Doesnt mean its not a fun movie either. The problem with you is if a movie isnt exactly the way you expect it to be you hate it regardless of the content. Proof? Simple, You havent once criticized the story line its self and you cant criticize the film with out putting your own emotions in to it or not mention the fact it has explosions. Fights are not boring your board with fights. I love the plot. Get Started
screenjunkies I dont have doubt that Die Hard 5 have the same background of Silent Hill 4. Hey we can change the name of the characters and call it Die Hard, will sell more.
screenjunkies I always get teary eyed at that song
screenjunkies You guys are Awesome!!!!!!
screenjunkies Watched this just because of the oscars
screenjunkies haha! caught Hal off guard  0:07. love Screenjunkies btw
screenjunkies haha! caught Hal off guard  0:07. love Screenjunkies btw

screenjunkies As you wish, my lady. watch?vuuPtDHWeDUE
screenjunkies ate quando eles morrem eles voltam mais brancoskkkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies Concordo com a Blenda sobre isos ser humor, mas temos que convir que pra uma trilogia que clamava fazer um super heri o mais realista possvel, ele meio que falhou, no acha?
screenjunkies Muitos erros eu deixei passar quando vi no cinema, mas a morte dela foi demais pra mim, eu ri pra caralho meu deus UAHEUEHAUHEAUHE
screenjunkies Best movie interview ever?
screenjunkies The great thing about the internet is that all kind of crazies can open a channel and go out and interview celebrities... And I mean this as a compliment.
screenjunkies with the current state of the film industry the entire cast might be Nicholas Cage and Tyler Perry. God help us all.
screenjunkies DO GOSSIP GIRL HONEST TRAILER! Please!

screenjunkies Johnny Depp couldnt do Edward from Twilight because Edward has to be a Pssy.
screenjunkies Johnny depp could not play the role of any of the women from the hobbit.
screenjunkies A role he couldnt play? I dont know... Willy Wonka?
screenjunkies I watched TDK 5 minutes ago and still his performance is great..I couldnt even tell it was Heath..isnt that the point when you see just the character, not the actor?
screenjunkies The first joke was the best

screenjunkies lol they control the banks? true..story bro
screenjunkies Florida. Because Florida is farther north than New York. And New Yorks Jewish population moved north. To Flori... da... I dunno. Sometimes I dont understand satire without a British accent.
screenjunkies If your not jewish your not allowed to be offended by a jewish person mocking stereotypes... doesnt make sense.
screenjunkies kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk mas o Gale NO  MAIS GATO QUE O MEU PEETA, ELE BAIXINHO, SIM, MAS  LINDO
screenjunkies Well at least one person did go as someone from the final fantasy franchise and good see some cosplayers out there

screenjunkies BLACKNERD iS MARIO!!!!
screenjunkies Ciel doing nothing... makes such a change from the series....
screenjunkies This is actually funny though. Loved all the references XD
screenjunkies haha random ass Darth Nihilus
screenjunkies Kinda surprised Dumbledore lost it for them. He could have summoned up his phoenix and flown the ball over to the endzone just saying lol
screenjunkies did anyone else see the girl dressed as Edd from Cowboy Bebop?
screenjunkies Why is this guy getting hate?! The whole channel is AWSONE including you Hal
screenjunkies eRRM what a great guy.

screenjunkies 5:09...no, sweetie. Just...no, dont do that
screenjunkies these poor poor little girls
screenjunkies This is so cruel! I love it!
screenjunkies The 11 year old shouldnt even of went lol its PG13!
screenjunkies That Kirk guy mustve been really mad knowing all that succesful guessing did nothkng in the end...
screenjunkies This is so deliciously evil! I love it! Except if I was doing it, nobody would win. Because nobody should see any of these movies ever.
screenjunkies I came here to see teenager tears full of grief, not freaking joy tears... dam im so lonly tonight
screenjunkies 11 years old, fine. 13? Sure. 15?? What the duck.
screenjunkies Should have had Jack sparrow finish as Lando
screenjunkies Until now Id never realized Donald speak just like a Jawa.
screenjunkies What do you think the upcoming Disneyproduced Star Wars is going to look like?
screenjunkies Agreed. A generation of girls born from teen pregnancies are gonna perform their first facepalms after hearing that their mothers decided Renesmee. Its like Stephenie Meyer thought Fuck it, lets just combine 2 names and call it a night
screenjunkies Adventure time drinking game.
screenjunkies renesme is a shit name
screenjunkies Walking dead drinking game: take a shot every time they waste ammo while they just could have beaten the zombie to death. (honestly how much ammo does rick and co. have?)
screenjunkies this actually pretty good to watch besides the honest trailer
screenjunkies 1:55 dolan y u do dis?
screenjunkies You guys actually stole some guys phone whilst one of you held back to try and make sure he didnt chase him? Regardless of whether you gave it back, the poor guy must have been absolutely terrified! This is nothing more than bullying.
screenjunkies Mitt Romney comment... only the BEST THING EVER!!!!
screenjunkies Not funny, just aholes trying to be
screenjunkies That was fucking hilarious!
screenjunkies On the contrary, people dislike this because they have a good SENSE of humor, as in high quality taste in comedy and do not get a kick out of annoying people. I dont even consider this a type of prank, Its just two goofballs walking up to a person going about their business and says this is not your cellphone and runs away with it. Where is the practical joke in that? If you are amused by this then you have a very very poor taste in comedy.
screenjunkies This video is fucking hilarious! What are you guys talking about? How often do you get to see people going this far to annoy people? Not that often. So, when someone has risked getting punched in the face for your entertainment, then you fucking appreciate it.
screenjunkies Speaks like ScreenJunkies Honest Trailers narrator. These are the guys that make those hilarious Honest Trailers? Seriously?
screenjunkies You will like this video
screenjunkies I believe the voice is saying it wants food.
screenjunkies ...::out of nowhere::....Beetlejuice..lmao
screenjunkies whos the previous person who needed to point out it wasnt real IT WAS JOKE laughing at all the 100s of hours of ghost hunting footage that catches nothing but make hour shows

screenjunkies casper...SHOW YOURSELF!!!
screenjunkies uh dog and plane or SANTA lololol XD
screenjunkies Hm. You dont say? I hadnt noticed.
screenjunkies what the fuck just happend to me?
screenjunkies seriously. and my country sucks???? FK... that is the most awful reality show I ever seen... Sht,,,,
screenjunkies Honey Boo Boo  her mom respond to Christopher Walken  colleagues reenacting scenes from their show.This is, uh, I dont know what, but its worth watching.
screenjunkies This is why I i dont watch television anymore.
screenjunkies 1:12 seeing Jabba the Hutt and her idiotic sugar fueled imbecile of a daughter make a fool out of herself on national television isnt exactly what you would call everyday people.
screenjunkies Hurry up and do it already
screenjunkies The mother seems polite and mature, thanking him for having them on the show and listening to his questions, while her daughter was being rather rude and ignorant. I was about to rethink my negative view of them until she made that little outburst at the moment.
screenjunkies Id prefer it if they stuck to Walken reading other peoples lines, not the other way around.
screenjunkies Oh my God Colin needs to be in a comedy his accent is fuckin epic.
screenjunkies Man did I feel sorry for Hal at the end of the video.
screenjunkies A) Christopher Walken is the greatest actor of all time! B) I CANT BELIEVE DUDE ATE THAT SKETTI!!!
screenjunkies Any Honey Boo Boo fans?
screenjunkies Chris Walken can read anything and everything and make it hypnotic. Even troll comments would be more amusing coming from Chriss mouth.
screenjunkies Grow a sense of humor for fucks sake haha.
screenjunkies Not sure if troll... or just never seen the show...
screenjunkies One day I heard somebody say Honey Boo Boo is the next Madonna. So then I said No, Honey Boo Boo is the next Zach Galiafanakis... but not as funny.
screenjunkies ...trilogia mais clssica que poderoso chefo...  pegar pesado demais. Nem entro no mrito de qual  melhor, s digo que The Godfather  muito mais emblemtico que Alien no meio cinematogrfico.
screenjunkies timo trabalho, mas uma correo: State of the art significa algo super atualizado, ou seja, seria Mapaz atualizados de ponta.. D Mais uma vez, timo trabalho com os vdeos... D

screenjunkies estrelando Mace Windu HUASUHSAUHSAUHS
screenjunkies como assim fingem conhecer?
screenjunkies eu so to nerd que eu sabia que aquele era o thanos quando eu assisti no cinema
screenjunkies , a parte do fone  realmente estranha, mas aposto que s os fs da DC concordam com todo o resto da legenda. Coloca todos da DC numa superviso a suicdio, t loco.
screenjunkies kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk incrivel... pensei que s eu tive estas impresses ao assistir os vingadores kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
screenjunkies Esse negcio do bruce controlar a raiva  escroto msm, primeiro pq o bruce e o hulk no so EXATAMENTE a msma pessoa, eles compartilham o msm corpo( ou )Mas no so a msma pessoa, logo, realmente essa  a coisa que  faz sentido no filme.
screenjunkies this was horrible and borderline offensive, and im a fan of lots of your work lol
screenjunkies They made TAKEN 2 on the logic that the low life russian protitution ring mobster would want to avenge the anonymous death of his son(s) left for dead in the trail of the overskilled godlike pissoff of a father Liam Neison is. I bet the third installement will include the family of the big headed buyer. And guess what http:www.allocine.frfilmfichefilmgencfilm214007.html   Why Liam!?! Why?
screenjunkies This guy needs to be the new host on too much tuna nickkroll toomuchtuna
screenjunkies that was a nice armbar

screenjunkies Say: The Human Centipede: 100 Medically Accurate. Now do the The Human Centipede, parts 1  2.
screenjunkies lol you got me there.
screenjunkies The movie is too easy to pick apart. Theres nothing to really say to defend it except call people who didnt like i haters.
screenjunkies ChilisI hated the little girl
screenjunkies I didnt like the girl
screenjunkies it is so funny, this show
screenjunkies The Avengers was a terrible movie, but not for the reasons these idiots stated. First, its plot was really simplistic, cheesy and lacked depth and creativity. Its all about the good guys kicking the bad guys ass. Typical super hero bullshit (and dont get me wrong: theres nothing I enjoy more than fantasy, but, you know,GOOD one). Then, one more thing: if Gods are supposed to be immortal, whats the point of even fighting?! Why didnt Loki break that glass when he was captive on the ship or whatever? The entire thing was so stupid and set up for plot convenience. The kind of mindless, poorly written action that appeals to twelve year old boys. If you want real fantasy, watch LotR and if you want real sciencefiction, watch SW. Youre welcome.
screenjunkies I hate every last one of them. how can you NOT liek the Avengers???!!Its the definition of KICKASS!!!
screenjunkies Heres a reason. Have you ever looked at captain America then thought he was really Captain purter Rico
screenjunkies Fuck avengers. It sucked. Ironman, and thor are the only people in that hopeless movie that didnt suck huge balls. I cant stand marvel.
screenjunkies Superhero movies are all the same, youre all just special effects junkies.
screenjunkies Hilarious, Flula! Love the And then you will enjoy it
screenjunkies I love the big flula drop at 1:44! Seriously flula, do more. So great
screenjunkies Actually if you see the other video they put out with the longer interview with him he is cracking up and I think he was just so thrown off by flula as would anyone who has never heard of him.
screenjunkies Can I buy that on iTunes?
screenjunkies a friend of a friend told me about this video. i am liking it.
screenjunkies BOOM!!! Love your interviews!
screenjunkies DJ Flula reminds me of Ian Hecox xP
screenjunkies WHY IS THIS NOT ON THE FLULA CHANNEL
screenjunkies Xalner is right... My god you people are retards.
screenjunkies Who the fuck would spell like you. UR DA ONLEE GAY NIGGA TW0 SPELLZ LIK DAT FAGGOT.
screenjunkies Here is how you know its fake, never once does Eric say holy shit I think Im on something
screenjunkies This is exactly what its like on mushrooms. You get scared easily though and then things become not so fun.
screenjunkies Erics so cuuuute. Doesnt he melt your hearts?
screenjunkies 5 buckets of popcorn, and 2 sodas.
screenjunkies Dude your friend is actually broken
screenjunkies You should eat more shrooms. Laughter is good for you

screenjunkies Severus, please and Fly you fools
GameSack Everything about this video is the greatest thing Ive ever seen
GameSack hahahahah actual tears at the last one
GameSack This is the best thing!
GameSack this has got to be done again in different situations brilliant
GameSack THE LADY IN THE BLACK JACKET THO
GameSack It was quite a big problem if you hadnt made preparations beforehand. Especially quite difficult to do in the early game when youre still getting set up and getting the materials you need.
screenjunkies Watched this last night, all 4 hours of it. Great movie.
screenjunkies F words. haha clever.
screenjunkies Do an Honest Trailer for Labyrinth aka. the David Bowie movie
screenjunkies Amazing...compressed the whole movie into 2:30... dont need to watch it again now!
screenjunkies Can you say: if you wanna be my lover you gotta get with my friends ??
screenjunkies So, Fbombs are not allowed, but Fag girls shoes. (1:20) is?Nice, Screen Junkies...
screenjunkies I feel like this wouldve been funny if I wouldve watched the movie.
screenjunkies You should watch with your Mom this movie:A Serbian Film.
screenjunkies What about some foreign movies, like Snatch, Run Lola Run or Trainspotting?
screenjunkies I would have to say True Romance is my favorite 90s movie because it taught me the origins of Sicilians.
screenjunkies I Loved Reservoir Dogs, One of Quentin Tarantino best films. Its a good story line and the suspense in finding out who was the undercover cop in the film, oh and the ending shoot out was crazy too.
screenjunkies I dont know if this was made in the 90s, but I like National Treasure.
screenjunkies Have your mother watch the wolf of Wall Street. DO IT.
screenjunkies why you didnt mention fighting club?But Im glad that you put the south park movie on the great not mentioned film list at the end
screenjunkies Clueless and the first Scream
screenjunkies Say: Friendship is magic in the wonderful land of Equestria.
screenjunkies Do a Trailer for Kick Ass 1 and 2
screenjunkies do a divergent honest trailer
screenjunkies The Amazing SpiderMan 2!!!!1
screenjunkies Please do Amazing Spiderman 2. That movie was a piece of shit put on screen.
screenjunkies Please, say: This is going to be a match to remember! FIGHT!. Thanks!
screenjunkies Say Now you see me now your dead!
screenjunkies Do the sixth sense!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Or i am going to kill u!!!!
screenjunkies Id love to see an origins of Nick Mundy video. I want know how he became the ball of fury he is now.
screenjunkies Also...DONT GIVE ROBOTS BALLS. Thats lame .
screenjunkies No. whatever: new (read old) sound effects. What the hell was wrong with the original sound effects? In the first scene in the first movie I was so happy when the chopper actually had a cool sound when it transformed. And that was the last time it was ever used.. (spoken in a solemn voice).
screenjunkies dino bots!!!!!!!!yes they better not fuck it up i agree.
screenjunkies I wanna see what nick mundy thinks of captain america winter soldier
screenjunkies Really, random fat guy who yells? Execs who made BILLIONS of dollars on just, 3 movies, are gonna listen to you? Seriously 2.7, once again BILLIONS, of dollars with only 3 movies. You say less funny yet you want a witty main character. You say more action then show less than 10 of the egregious amount of robot fighting porn of the movies. Then use Pacific Rim as an example, the shots are fair mind you, but the fights are dumb. Only one Jaiger has a sword? Its not like guns are the main weapon of these machines, simply punching them in the face is the best move, and yet only one goddamn sword was seen. The sequal better be like hundreds of Jaigers and they all have swords, or hammers, or maces.
screenjunkies The problem with Transformers is Michael Bay. That guy... SUCKS!!!!!!!
screenjunkies im english and think its entirely possible that we wiuld be corrupted by decepticon technology :L hahahaha
screenjunkies Being British.. I must say I found that comment... actually really funny. I would love to see Optimus rip Big Ben right out of the ground too. XD
screenjunkies i was watching chinatown.. and for somereason i started whatching this clip.. i paused right away :
screenjunkies Bad ass montage. Bravo, Screen Junkies!
screenjunkies what about iron man 3
screenjunkies :D  Cmon baby, lets do the twist! :D
screenjunkies Memento? Psh, the whole movie was basically one big twist. And why include the 2006 version of the Wicker Man?
screenjunkies At 1:14 there is clearly no gunshot wound on Matt Damons face.
screenjunkies 3:10 he is a bastard though?
screenjunkies A very special episode? lol!
screenjunkies do the books have a main charachter?
screenjunkies DO THE PAGEMASTER!!!!!!
screenjunkies Say, winter is coming.
screenjunkies you look like that comic bookshop guy from Big Bang Theory
screenjunkies Watch for the comment section.For the web is dark and full of spoilers. Youve been warned.
screenjunkies Get itSorry spelling error joffrey
screenjunkies Am i the only one who likes lil bran? I havent read the books but i would imagine his story becomes important in the battle against the white walkers
screenjunkies Whatever happened to Gendry? So Davos just let him leave Dragonstone and now hes just not gonna be in Season 4 at all? Hes not even dead yet! What happens???
screenjunkies Spoiler Alert, those Easter Eggs I have in the fridge.....
screenjunkies How can Tonks be a Uhuh? :D
screenjunkies Do Doctor Who honest trailer
screenjunkies King Justin beiber is dead YEAAH!!!!
screenjunkies Imp Slap  Lord Friendzone  PIMP FRIENDZONE
screenjunkies Hey if youre doing TV shows, Id say Downton Abbey would make a great Honest Trailer.
screenjunkies Why is the resolution only 240p?
screenjunkies Michael Bay isnt directing! Hes producing it! Therefore it might not be that shit!
screenjunkies Honest Trailers are great!!!
screenjunkies So the Turtles are patterned after Greezel from Ghoulies? I guess that makes sense, the turtles live in the sewer and Greezel likes to emerge from toilets.
screenjunkies Well I dont care if its bad or good I just want to enjoy it.
screenjunkies Wow.....didnt know Black Nerd Guy had a gut
screenjunkies From what I see from the trailer this wasnt just Hollywood raping my childhood this was them jacking off on its cold dead corpse. I know we all have problems with it. Shredder is white and Megan Fox as April but it could be M. Night Shyamalan directing so really it could be worse. So much fucking worse.
screenjunkies I dont care if you racebend April, hell, I dont even care if you genderbend April, THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT IS THAT SHE STILL HAS TO BE A REDHEAD!!! Come on, movie!

screenjunkies It took me a while to recover from Requiem For A Dream. Quite fucked up but more so particularly depressing for me.
screenjunkies L short from ABCs of death or any of the deaths scenes from Maniac.
screenjunkies Hard Candy is my favorite. That fake castration scene is what sold me on Ellen Page for good, I dont care what shes in, Im going to see it.
screenjunkies the devils rejects!! and not a seen the whole god damn movie!
screenjunkies What about Singapore Sling, when the mom who is a hermaphrodite, ties up the detective on her bed, rapes him by riding him, and then when she orgasms, she sticks her finger down her throat and pukes on his face?
screenjunkies As a kid, there were two movie scenes that scared me. One was the maggot birth in The Fly and blood filled balloons in Stephen Kings It. As an adult I saw a Japanese movie with a sick, dying mermaid covered in pus bubbles. An artist was using her pus to paint. The rest of that movie was rapey. I still cant get those visuals out of my head.
screenjunkies Dead baby on the ceiling in Trainspotting was one of the most disturbing things Ive seen on film.
screenjunkies You failed to mention, ANY POLLY SHORE MOVIE!!! Now THEY are Fked UP!

screenjunkies Wreck it Ralph is my FAVORITE video game movie and one of my favorite movies period. Because of SUGAR RUSH if I were in the world of Sugar Rush, I WOULD EAT EVERYTHING (Then I would have a true sugar rush) LOL
screenjunkies Im surprised they never brought up the resident evil movies.
screenjunkies Max Payne would do an awesome movie!... oh, wait
screenjunkies Wreck it Ralph and Scott Pilgrim are two best movies for video game fans. I would like to see a super smash movie. There will be brawl had some solid moments, but I think an amazing movie could be told. Perhaps just start with Super Mario Bros and build the world out from there.
screenjunkies I do like silent hill and resident evil
screenjunkies do you think its weird that movie goers hate moviegames, and gamers hate gamemovies
screenjunkies I had to search up like half of these references.

screenjunkies Wish there was a full poooork song
screenjunkies maybe it is just me,but outside of the plot,character development and music i find the drawing style pretty lazy,i know the CGI effect looks ok but all the characters with close ages and same gender have the same facial features and proportions.

screenjunkies Neil Patrick Harris! It would be legendary!!
screenjunkies Chuck Norris did one for a Polish bank. It was a very, very delayed aftershock of the Chuck Norris meme... which came to the party about three years too late.
screenjunkies These Watch These Movies comments are so annoying :(
screenjunkies Bruce willis should do a die hard commercial for baby milk where him and the super strong, milk drinking baby defeats the enemy! :)

screenjunkies Say Lets Go Find The Dam Snack Bar
screenjunkies What DID happen to that hairy guy?
retrogametech Buy a N64 or an original playstation to repairrefurbish and add to your collection :P
retrogametech Always good to see you put another great vid on youtube man. Great find!
retrogametech No way, they didnt even try and change the fuse? Dumbasses!
retrogametech What a ridiculous bargain! Great system. Worth getting hold of the home brew version of Thrust.
retrogametech NiceandGames did a video about his Vectrex. He got a Time Pilot clone for it that someone made recently. Seemed to be a pretty cool game if you are interested.Also, you cant always trust continuity on fuzes. Sometimes the filament will flex under load and break contact if one side of the filament isnt properly soldered into place anymore. This is definitely a few and far between occurrence, but I thought I would share.
retrogametech Sweet pickup  easy fix for the win
retrogametech This game on the Vectrex was the first video game I ever played, so your video brought back some good memories for me. By the way, awesome deal you got there.
retrogametech excellent find! Ive always thought the vectrex was a very cool system.
retrogametech A new video at last, Thank you!!!
retrogametech Thats a massive score! What a great price for it! Vectrexes are a collectors wet dream.I have a feeling that possibly the seller deliberately pulled out the neutral pin, to comply with laws on selling vintage equipment. Anyway, great deal. Never sell that, its a goldmine.Recycledgamer Chuck van pelt possibly has some controllers for your system )
retrogametech You must be the only person in known universe to get two out of the two characters you wanted from two blind balls.
retrogametech Cool little figures, especially for 1
retrogametech The quality is horrible. And wtf they put werehog Sonic and not Tails?
retrogametech lol I bought two of these...got x2 knuckles
retrogametech Do you have a need or want for one or two Xbox (Original) Mod chips?One is packaged unused the other is probably FUBAR.
retrogametech Do you want the grape gbc for the lime one because I have most my computer systems in a sade of green
retrogametech I love the gameboy micro. Its screen is so nice and size just makes it probably one of the best handhelds. Good to see you back!
retrogametech 2014 room tour is in order :D
retrogametech Ive been wanting to try and do a backlight mod on my own original GBA as well and seeing how good it looks in this video just makes me want to do it even more.But since Im currently in Tokyo and havent gotten my own GBA around it will still be a while before I can get around and attempt it (been looking around over here for an SP 101 in advance, but havent had the luck to find one, then again I havent been looking around that much).
retrogametech hey retro good video, by curiosity i have a question top ask you, have you ever done a dual nub mod on a psp? like so he can see this :D
retrogametech Hi i have been subbed for a while now and really enjoy your videos about the strange and interesting things you find keep up good work
retrogametech loved the box of goodies..and good too know your alive and well..would like too see you modding the original xbox or lift the lid on your bad boys you already have and maybe a walk thru of the process . i have a modded one and now its showing error code 21 ..i have looked at the forums on alot of sites and read till my eyes are blurry i just dont understand all the jargen..if you would be so kind too do a video man it would help this old boy out .thanks and happy new year lol
retrogametech Glad to see you are back man :D I missed your cool accent lol
retrogametech 17:00 if we rob Martins House, AGS101 will be rare.
retrogametech Glad you found what you needed mate.
retrogametech Dumbed a few games, didnt take long to run into harddrive space issues
retrogametech think that is 128 megabytes not 128 megabit. think might be able to fit like every gba game on that thing.
retrogametech The atari cartridge I made is just 128KB which is 1000 times smaller than that gba cart. It can hold 32 games though. Atari2600 games are only 4K each.
retrogametech That machine is awesome!! I guess that little box of magic is where all our ROMs come from!
retrogametech When you do get it sorted, please do a video of it all working. Seems really interesting.
retrogametech This is the only lead I could find.http:www.gameboyadvance.netfalsoftflashadvancesoftware.htm
retrogametech This might be what youre looking for.Heres the link:How to install drivers for Gameboy GB USB smart card 64m on 64 bit windows 7
retrogametech Where can I buy ds flash carts from
retrogametech hey boss try this site http:www.ezfadvance.com
retrogametech Where did you get the ez flash IV from? i only found one on ebay for 85?? o.0
retrogametech Heres a site focusing on flashcarts and other related material for the GB, GBC, and GBA. http:www.reinerziegler.deGBAgba.htmDidnt see your flashcart, but maybe searching using related carts will turn something up?
retrogametech Looking at the packaging for the Smart Card and a few posts in Spanish, it seems like it never came with the software in the packaging. Theres people going back as far as 2004 looking for the software..
retrogametech Fire Shark kind of reminds me a bit of Empire of Steel from a top down perspective
retrogametech Lol, thats Korean on the back of the strider game.
retrogametech Mega Drive bootleg bonuses are the best bootleg bonuses going.
retrogametech GBA was great for old arcade ports :)
retrogametech I think people overlook the Lilo and Stitch games because they assume they are kids games. More people should base their opinion on game play.
retrogametech Thanks dude. Dont think LPs are really for me tbh. And theres so many people doing them these days! haha. Loads of great channels already dedicated to the subject  I think you really need a certain type of personality to pull it off without boring the crap outta people :P
retrogametech great vid, im a massive gba fan, its the only system i collect for, people dont seem to realise how many amazing games there are
retrogametech I never had a GBA, been thinking about picking one up, I have two games that I used to play on my DS, Gunstar Future Heroes and Sword of Mana. Both great and fairly uncommon I think? Not sure but I think theyre worth a bit of money still.
retrogametech There are tons of great games you should check out. Im going to try and put together a couple of videos on the subject in the coming week :) .
retrogametech Great video, I really need to grab a GBA, I keep hoping to grab a GBA SP NES edition but nothing at a good price as of yet. I would just buy it for Micro Machines to be honest lol. What software do you use to edit your videos?
retrogametech Lego games are awesome:) i own nearly all the lego 360 games ! great fun great puzzles and all have a comical side to them too :) lego lotr is my fav so far:) keep up the great work dude :) rob:)
retrogametech In Jurrasic Park you have to connect the shops to a path not the road.
retrogametech The SD player for your .mkv files what is that exactly?I use a Westerndigital video player that I connect my external HDs to, but I always have difficulty finding a good external player for my growing MKV files. please share.
retrogametech How much was your little multimedia player you have looking into getting one
retrogametech Well I dont have all my consoles in a single room. The N64 and PS3 are in my brothers room, hooked up to the monitor on his desk, plus where half of the PS1 games are. The PS4 and Wii are in the game room, which is also where most of the games are. A 360 is in my other brothers room, and we use to have one downstairs in the living room. The Xbox, another Xbox 360, and Xbox One are in my room, all hooked up to my tv. The PS1 is in my closet along with half of the games I have for it. Plus I have a Sega Genesis plugnplay in my closet.
retrogametech Cool, I have that setup myself. I bought the Phat PS2, a network adapter, and found an old PATA HDD by Maxtor which fits perfectly. I modded my memory card from my Modded Slim PS2 and load HD Loader from it on my Phat PS2. I rip my games their, 1) Laser lasts, discs arent used (just once to rip), faster. Its very useful
retrogametech I have no intention of getting either. I dont know anything about them, I quit paying attention about A day after the Xbox Three was announced. Even if I wanted one, Id wait A year or two. After that RROD shit I dont trust either of them.
retrogametech Amazing set up, it looks incredibly well laid out and organised. The matching black scheme across the whole thing really ties it together, great work man!
retrogametech So we can expect a sex toys collection and pickup vid in the near future then? P.s. That is some weak sauce excuse for not collecting!...... need more shelves, pfffftttt... :P
retrogametech Yeah, its an epic trilogy! :)
retrogametech I dont even know what that is, haha
retrogametech Isnt that a Hammerburst not a Lancer?
retrogametech I might have to start responding to these top 3 tuesdays. My most obscure items would have to be my sealed copy of Pilot for the Timex Sinclair 1000, the only one I know of. I had Sega Saturn Devkit (Cartdev. Rev. B) I found at a local game store. I modded a saturn to interface with it, but I sold it a couple months ago for nearly twice what I paid. My only other somewhat obscure item is my prerelease rental dreamcast console (I used to have two).
retrogametech dude would u ever do a giveaway like idk the retro lancer haha :)
retrogametech Wow, I was just watching some old Retro Game Tech videos! Always glad to see RGT in my sub box :)
retrogametech Im really surprised that they dont sell for more! For less than the price of a new 360PS3 game you can get a fully boxed new Neo Geo system and 1 game. Crazy!
retrogametech Haha, well theres still another 7 of these available from the same seller if youre interested :P Thanks for watching  commenting!
retrogametech Yes, I have to admit I wouldnt mind getting one myself  the fighting board seems the best bet as it seems to support 4 games. I dont know what SNK were thinking of? After the success of the MVSAES and the great idea of one board that takes all the carts they end up producing 3 different boards... Its also a shame that they felt they had to compete with the 3D market that had started as many people loved the 2D SNK games and not the new 3D generation.
retrogametech Haha, if only I had the space for some cabs! :)
retrogametech Pretty cool! How on earth do you keep finding amazing bargains!
retrogametech Not really. I have a couple sitting on the shelf but I dont think you could call it a collection.
retrogametech Sorry mate, I was right that they would sell quickly when this vid came up :0). From looking at other comments it seems that this seller sells batches of these from time to time so you should be able to pick up another one at some point.
retrogametech Just curious, does arcade hardware like the Hyper Neo Geo usually have regional differences?
retrogametech Have this and Love this controller on my PC for Dark Souls !!
retrogametech Haha, I think Id have to be really drunk to make that mistake :P
retrogametech Hello any chance you can fix my 3ds please my slot wont work and I saw your video but I dont have those tools may you please fix it for me
retrogametech Awesome! I do the same thing  bathroom sink (or bath) to clean consoles and controllers etc. The one thing I dont do is put the rubber parts in with the carbon pads  safer to just wipe them lightly. That said, some people put the circuit boards in the dishwasher  I kid you not.
retrogametech Its not so much talent, just basic soldering skills :P
retrogametech My face has featured in several previous vids :P
retrogametech id you have any spare time can you tell me what soldering iron you used in this video i would like to get started repairing xbox controllers as a job with my freind thank you for reading :)
retrogametech Fuck off you stereo typical bastard.
retrogametech Clone Console  Mega Drive X  Russian Import  Fake SEGA Genesis Mk3  Mini Review
retrogametech .   ,     ,      .           ,   ,        .
retrogametech Yeah, Ive been subbed for years!
retrogametech Love the Pokemon on the back.
retrogametech A smartphone with a emulator would do a way better job at playing games than this thing would.
retrogametech It had to be done! :P
retrogametech Thanks! Ive been wanting to make vids but just havent had the time. Appreciate the support :)
retrogametech Haha, really? Ill need to check and see.
retrogametech You could probably make a homemade Nomad out of an old GameGear and a cheap LCD screen :)
retrogametech i have the same sky box
retrogametech How about a games room tour Martin?
retrogametech Awesome teardown video.
retrogametech Well, the neighbour is really just a landlord and I think the last tenant did a runner without paying the rentbills. He was just gutting the property for the next guy I think. Sky would probably have like the box back :P 25 seems like a pretty sweet deal considering the games you got! GoldenEye splitscreen multiplayer was still being heavily played by me and my friends well into the 2000s.
retrogametech As long as its not on private property then there is nothing illegal about it.
retrogametech I think those GBA games are fake.
retrogametech Lots of parts to harvest :)
retrogametech how about a tech parts bin tour video??? id like to compare our different parts... why does that sound so wrong? S
retrogametech Thanks for the Hard drive idea, went to car boot today and picked up a Sky HD Box (Samsung) for 5 and got a 300GB HDD out of it :) Going to do it again next week, looking for a Amstrad as they have 2TB1TB HDDs
retrogametech Hey your cool Im subbed :)
retrogametech I never had a PS2 so missed out on Ico and Shadow of the Colossus. I had planned on getting the 2 pack PS3 HD port, but ended up getting it free on PS. I still havent played Ico yet but have really enjoyed Shadow, Im about halfway through.
retrogametech Yeah, good luck with that :P
retrogametech Later PAL DS games come in the smaller NTSC cases, at least the Pokemons did. I never got why Nintendo uses different cases in different regions, the ones that weird me out are the Gamecube where the Gamecube logo on the spine is on the bottom of NTSC copies, and the Wii U where the spine is white rather than blue in the PAL copies.
retrogametech ICO is actually the prequel to Shadow of the Colossus.
retrogametech RetroGameTech im a photo student in the states. i was wondering who made the game programer you used to get the pics of of you gameboy camera (model number would be good to). I would love to do a project with it.
retrogametech subscribed. first time! great deal on the ico.
retrogametech But was it really? Was it an official US release or just imported PAL copies? Ive never been able to find any US sellers that have an NTSC version of it. I cant even find a photo of a US copy. But, if it does exist then Id love to get it! :)
retrogametech According to RetroCollect. com, you can now get a flash cart for the Pokemon Mini called the Pokecard.
retrogametech Help me, ObiWan Kenobi. Youre my only hope.
retrogametech I have a us version. i got it as a present when it was new.
retrogametech Martin I have a aus 101 in pink so we no there definitely 2 colours
retrogametech my friend boy got 3 of this and my other friend got one of this also and its in philippines
retrogametech it came in a dark green, and dark blue
retrogametech My brother had one, tribal edition...
retrogametech I probably have ADHD but thats a Much better way to.. HEY! A Sega Master System.
retrogametech there is a reason why this type of work costs alot, you have to factor in the cost of parts, resources, shipping to and from aswell as labor, it takes alot of time to do mods where soldering is involved
retrogametech I have a whole closet full of to sell things and the pile keeps getting bigger and bigger.
retrogametech Yay, at least you got one good one out of the two!
retrogametech Nice to see that at least one of them will find a new home in fully working condition. I expected it to sell for a bit more though.
retrogametech In the end I actually just listed it as a buy it now with best offer. There wasnt much interest so I just discounted it to sell. Someone got a very nice deal though :) . I think the problem is, anyone dedicated enough to invest in the expense of Neo Geo AES collecting, is probably going to do it properly and buy themselves a really nice clean undamaged console. My refurb unit would only be good for straight up gamers or to someone as a secondary backup system.
retrogametech Even works on dsi games and ds games. :)
retrogametech its actually JUST start, its Start and Select to ALL DS and DSi ware games and makes them on their native resolutions, though on a regular 3DS, its WAY too small, looks OK on a XL
retrogametech I bet that 3d feature looks great in person!
retrogametech look at the where on the game boy color buttons
retrogametech Thats really neat with the 3D depth thing. Nintendo oneupped the PC emulation gurus by adding that, methinks.
retrogametech i didnt know about this game... just saw this price of it on ebay O
retrogametech Wouldnt you prefer colour spelled thus?
retrogametech Unfortunately it would still be the wrong resolution and youd also lose the cool 3D effect. But I see what youre saying.
retrogametech Haha, well I appreciate you listeningwatching me ramble regardless. Tbh, half the time I dont really understand what Im talking about either. :P
retrogametech Thanks. I didnt permanently mod anything on the clone ) . Just soldered a few wires in place to grab RGB and disable the forced 50Hz video. After making the vid I reversed everything back to stock.
retrogametech So close! haha. Its a sync issue but I have no clue how to correct it. I also suspect the CPU in the clone might be clocked differently to a real MD and that is whats causing the issues. Who knows :P
retrogametech Tried all of those. The last one usually works best :)
retrogametech I thought everdrives regions didnt matter, anyways never stop making videos please.
retrogametech Never thought Id hear you say it doesnt work!
retrogametech You must be relatively young if CRT whine is audible enough for you to distinguish in this vid let alone be annoyed by it! haha I didnt notice it while making the recording and cant even hear it in the final video!
retrogametech aaaam watch?vWoX8odhoE
retrogametech you should get driver for the wii was very fun :p
retrogametech Get House of the Dead Overkill, and Dead Space  both awesome! The Resident Evil ones are great as well  Unbrella Chronicles (theres another RE on rails shooter I forget the name of).
retrogametech Thanks. Ill check it out :)
retrogametech xD Ive had mine done for ages too! Its so convenient!
retrogametech My Wii turns on by itself, what should i do?
retrogametech hi im a big fan. I have a question. What soldiering iron do you use. You inspired me to fix things and i need a good soldering iron
retrogametech Thanks! Well technically its no longer the current gen system from Nintendo and theyve been dropping support for it so yeah I guess its now classed retro. But in saying that, Ive never claimed this channel was about or limited to one specific topic or genre. Maybe tomorrow Ill review some TV shows or do some gardening tutorials :P
retrogametech Sin  Punishment, Muramasa, Okami, Kirbys Epic Yarn, No More Heroes 1 and 2, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption (way better than Other M), definitely Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Super Paper Mario .... There are so many really good games for Wii that are really inexpensive! Nows a great time to pick em up!
retrogametech Normally this is where I would recomend okami but the hd remake on ps3 just blows it away...
retrogametech Cheers Seb! Yeah, seems nobody wants their Wii games anymore. Perfect time for thrifty games like me to pickup up some really good games on the cheap! Nintendo games have a habit of suddenly increasing in value. Thought Id give my collection a head start. :P
retrogametech I dont believe Ive ever heard of this accessory before, it must have come out very late in the life of the GBA, possibly 2005 or 2006. It wouldnt support SDHC cards because that standard wasnt really developed until late 2006some time in 2007. Interesting product, I know there were third party MP3 players for the GBA.
retrogametech Wow thats cool! I wonder if that was released in America
retrogametech Could this be used as a flashcart?
retrogametech If nintendo made a decent phone out of the ds (With android) I would so buy it
retrogametech It should do yes. I havent tested that though.
retrogametech That box has a similar desing to the webbrowser addon. I saw those when I was in France 4 years ago.
retrogametech nice1, didnt know this even existed! :)
retrogametech Reminds me of those dodgy Chinese media player carts that you could flash with an alternate firmware, and then run backup roms off the SD card. ... is that what the moonshl entry was?
retrogametech Way cool! I would permanently install rocket knight adventures on it! Best game, best music EVER!
retrogametech This was great. I remember some shady dudes selling the scorpion in Northampton shopping centre back in the day. And I never forgot it. Glad to hear its actually a good system. Thanks for the video, it was very informative and I loved all the tech stuff.
retrogametech Theres a picture of a Colecovision on the RF switch
retrogametech Bloody hell I remember that haha
retrogametech Cool vid. Beatties was an awesome shop. Bought my first RC car (van) from there Lunchbox.
retrogametech Made in Taiwan!. All those Megadrive clones was made in Taiwan!!!!
retrogametech Damn, now I have another clone console I want... thanks a lot! lol
retrogametech Ha! Im surprised youve not found one at a carboot by now! :P The Scorpion branded version seems uber rare. The thing with the extra cart slot is strange. If you look carefully, even the one shown on Bad Influence is missing the extra connector. Theres another Scorpion console review on YT and it doesnt even have the hatch at all. Andy Crane also tried to plug that review cart in the wrong end! :P Beatties was awesome as a kid! Mine had a running model railway suspended from the ceiling!
retrogametech i remember watching that on bad influence, I thought it was neat and wanted one never did manage to find one back in the day
retrogametech I see Megamix at the start. Nice!
retrogametech I was hell bent on bidding on this and bloody missed it!! However now I know you got it, it eases the pain!! Im just realy glad no spotty little scrote with a butane soldering iron and a burning desire to fix the world got hold of it!
retrogametech Those are definitely the best types of deal. You can sometimes just tell from someones auction listing that they either dont care or have no idea how to properly test something :P This occasion was just a very nice surprise. I thought I was only buying faulty parts boards! XD
retrogametech You need to be checking ebay multiple times a day to find the good stuff )
retrogametech Can anyone please tell me why there seems to be an LCD display built in to the front of his Xbox?
retrogametech Great price and great ending. As Hannibal Smith used to say I love it when a plan comes together!!
retrogametech love watching your videos  your such a thrithy bastard lol
retrogametech The noise is make by the fan. Disconnect it is not an option, an ATX power supply is powerful an needs to be cooled. You can find an official Nintendo Wii AC adapter for less than 25 euro easily (try Play  Asia) )
retrogametech Have you check the cable? If the cable is ok you have to check for leaking capacitor in the sound area of the mainboard.
retrogametech Awesome setup homie,all you need is to paint the broom stick handle the same as the other legs,na its just this my ocd,by the way did you know that wayforward is remastering the nes ducktales...
retrogametech Humans are naturally curious. If we can learn something from it we generally enjoy it, a lot. :)
retrogametech Most Wii games are optimised for 4:3. And overall the console just looks better in that ratio.
retrogametech arff i just realized even your avatar has scanlines
retrogametech I dont really plan my vids, just make them as I feel like it :). You should totally do a tour! Its always cool to see other peoples setups. Thanks for taking the time to watch and comment :)
retrogametech I designed it so it can be moved very easily as one complete unit. All the cabling is either bolted, screwed or fastened directly to the unit and cannot be moved or fall off. All I need to do is disconnectremove the TV and systems. All the wires and PSUs stay exactly where they are. I place the consoles in storage crates then secure the entire entertainment unit in wrapping film. Whole process takes about 20min max. Ive done it a few times now while redecorating. Huzzah! :)
retrogametech Amazing! Truly an inspiration for my and my plans to resurrect my gaming room. Thanks for the great post!
retrogametech Why dont you have the Wii in 16:9?
retrogametech U have more games than me
retrogametech i flashed my wii to get the black menu.
retrogametech The 360 and controllers were a steal. Great job.
retrogametech Yes, I did one a while back about fitting battery holders in GBC carts :)
retrogametech halo ODST was the first halo game to give me a headache while playing it. Every Halo after the original halo 3 gives me a headache when playing through the campaign. dont know weather its just me or not.(probably is). but from memory halo ODST is a good halo to get, the campaign is responsibly good (confusing at times, ie the snipe on the power lines takes a while to figure out where it is) and the multiplayer comes with all the DLC maps for halo 3 and it also has the firefight mode.
retrogametech I do enjoy this style of video! Cant beat a good waffle.
retrogametech The reason the Wii benefits (or any system really)  scan lines are anti aliasing for the brain ). Did a bit about that in my Dreamcast tear down vid. Keep up the great work )
retrogametech Haha, thanks. Glad you like this type of vid. Some people hate when a video lasts for more than 10 minutes :P
retrogametech Please read the message i sent you retrogametech please .
retrogametech is that a led mod in the wii sensor bar or does it help with how well it reads the wiimote?
retrogametech Make more videos of fixing defected consoles. Its just fun and interesting to watch.
retrogametech Haha, well if I hadnt been under challenge conditions with my reputation on the line.... :P
retrogametech Wow great job, enjoyed watching it
retrogametech Haha, I have no idea but at least its fixed :)
retrogametech Astounding work, well done !!
retrogametech I was watching some random videos, stumbled upon your channel, and 3 hours later, still loving them. What I wanted to ask, was that, Im newly out of high school, love video games, but also wanted to get into the dirty side, the repairs as you do in some of your recent videos. What exact college courses would they be under, and info and help would be greatly appreciated, keep up the good work!!
retrogametech Amazing mate, so impressed!
retrogametech Not seen to many of those but Id guess a lot of them just have dirtycorroded battery terminals.
retrogametech wow I think I posted on his original vid how difficult that would be to fix  impressive!
retrogametech This was a huge help!! Ive been agonizing trying to cut out those little white discs.
retrogametech Thanks. Very true! Its so frustrating when I heard someone say they junked a whole systemcontroller just because it developed a small fault. So many useful parts wasted! :( Im just really glad I managed to remember where Id stored those little contact discs! :P
retrogametech Do you use your much? Or do you prefer the arcade stick?
retrogametech Just needed a clean and reseat. Nothing worth showing )
retrogametech I absolutely love these videos.
retrogametech Haha, yeah what a surprise, another ebay seller sending out filthy items. Maybe I should invest in a box of disposable latex gloves for these vids :P.
retrogametech Lazy i understand, I enjoy watching been watching since 2010 when I started using YouTube and this is still my favorite channel. I also wanted to throw out, these videos are definitely not boring! I love to see people fixing videogame related stuff that otherwise would be thrown away. These things arent made anymore, we have to save as many as we can and only resort to cannibalizing them if theyre beyond repair.
retrogametech Thanks. Ive got a couple of working Neo Geo MVS boards at the moment. I paid around or just under 50 for each. The price really depends on the version you go for and condition. I see a lot of older working MVS boards sell for around 40. The games I was playing were Breakers and Robo Army. Breakers is probably my favourite fighting game on the system :)
retrogametech I checked this game out cuz of this vid and omg its amazing! As an 80s kid I thoroughly enjoyed it so thanks dude. Also good job on the case cover...very convincing :)
retrogametech Looks good as shit imitation beat you get people asking you to make them now
retrogametech I sometimes make my own cases for downloadable games (Like the Walking Dead, Journey e.t.c) since I need to have a tangible asset for my collection. This though, this is genious, defo printing one of these off tomorrow and sticking it on my shelf. Badass. Powerglove FTW.
retrogametech Pretty cool work there man, who knows, they made Halo 2600 right, this could happen too if the demand is high enough
retrogametech Sweeet, i wouldnt mind playing a 16 bit version of this game.
retrogametech Awesome work and thanks for sharing! Totally looks like the real deal!
retrogametech Im slowly working through my list of projects, but that one is still about 10th on the list. My goal is to wait until it is considered retro.
retrogametech So THATS what the little hole on the back of my Genesis is for. Not the extension port, the little hole to the left of it. The model 2 has a small hole in the back too though, and I still have no idea what thats for.
retrogametech The Dreamcast must be the first home console could play online out of the box. That apparently was one of the features they refused to remove despite being suggested to save manufacturing costs.
retrogametech Its definitely disappointing the way things are headed. Soon youll only be able to digitally rent games. And when the publisher decides its no longer profitable to support it, youll loose all access :( . But as a retro gamer my backlog will take more than a lifetime to play through :P
retrogametech Wow, talk about ahead of its time. I had no idea about this modem or pack. I feel even more sorry that Sega is out of the hardware business. Hope they will be back someday...
retrogametech Its great that the modem still works today. I wanna track down a broadband adapter for my Dreamcast and play some Phantasy Star Online :P
retrogametech lol that would be awesome if we could play online with that beast :D
retrogametech Great video review Martin. Sega was sure way ahead of its time.
retrogametech Thats insane! Who knew mega drive had a modem!
retrogametech Nice little collection piece.
retrogametech smaller tvs has smaller or no gaps between the scanlines.
retrogametech I think the best thing about CRT is the colour vibrancy :)
retrogametech Martin, if you pull the back off the telly youll usually find some pots on the rear of the PCB, focus, vhold hhold and more often than not pots for changing how much overscan is present, if theyre on adjustment sticks just put a couple holes above them in the back of the case to access via screwdriver when you need to, failing that just adjust to what you need and slap the back on again. The focus pot is a great way to fix fuzzy crts too
retrogametech Great video. Ive not got a Sony CRT (currently have a Samsung) but Im now interested in finding out if mines RGB and if it has a hidden service menu too. Didnt realise Scart output could differ or CRTs had service menus. Thanks for bringing this to my attention.
retrogametech why have everything going through 1 plug and not being able to use others for other stuff then have separate plugs for everything? WTF? Do you like plugging different devices into the same composite input or something?
retrogametech Great vid mate. Cheers
retrogametech I used to take stuff from my local tip all the time :). Id regularly take home the PCs, consoles and monitors Id see sitting in the skips. But one day an attendant clocked me putting an old PC monitor in my car and he went ape shit! Demanded I put it back and claimed it was council property!! I tried to explain I was planning to use it for a project and it would end up in landfill otherwise. He was having none of it and told me to leave! lol. They dont let people take stuff anymore :(
retrogametech I love these Sony trinitrons. Great quality TVs and perfect for retro gaming :)
retrogametech I was going to mention that asking 15 for this seems a bit cheeky. In my local recycling tip people chuck TVs like this out all the time and they just leave them in a big container for anyone to take. Ive gotten quite a few nice little CRTs from there for my retro consoles.
retrogametech You should have just got the Hanzo. Its a VGA adapter with a scanline generator.
retrogametech sorry but is there any way to use some sort of scanline generator for normal composite RCA connections? I have all these consoles and they all look like garbage, having two tvs in my living room just makes it looks silly and cluttered.
retrogametech Positive about that. I tested many times on my tv set 40 Sony LCD and the result in my opinion is very good, light scanline effect, very nice and smooth.
retrogametech It really varies game to game. Some look better without it, and some with. One thing Ive noticed is text clarity always seems to benefit from scanlines. Ive never seen the official DC VGA box either. I assume it must be pretty rare. Its odd because SEGA went to the trouble of marking VGA Compatible on the back of many games. Youd think theyd have promoted the peripheral itself a little harder.
retrogametech It really gives 2D games a nice arcady look :D . Thanks for watching!
retrogametech If you use this would a lightgun work with a lcd?
retrogametech Thanks xD . It was a nightmare trying to shoot this video without it looking like ass! :P
retrogametech is that vga box you have there from Consolegoods? it looks very similar to theres if it is is it any good? i got one of there mega drive rgb cables for my lcd tv and it works great and look amazing just wanna know so i dont waste any money
retrogametech It looks great on 15kHz 240p stuff, but highresolution 480P games like DOA never had visible scanlines (and neither do Naomi arcade monitors) so the gadget is making it less defined. Look at the bottom of the white garment on DOA (10:02). Theres a 4 pixel slant on the normal VGA output, theres only 2 pixels with the scaline generator as its overwritten every other line of genuine detail with a black line. So the illusion of more detail is actually a reduction in detail by 50.
retrogametech Mega drive MODEM? What in the world do you DO with a modem on the megadrive? I mean what games supported its use?
retrogametech It would do that horrible Dial Up screeching sound that used to happen back before broadband.
retrogametech Just wondering, did the Mega Drive even have a microphone attachment? I know it was just for fun, but if there was no microphone for it how would it work xD Keep up the good vids!
retrogametech No, it was a DREAMCAST in the skip! With Sonic adventure in the drive too!!!
retrogametech awesome dude, greetings from NYC
retrogametech I was thinking about this a few weeks back. The 9pin serial (EXT) socket on the Megadrive is female unlike the male socket which is typically found on a PC. With a gender changer I wonder if a standard modem or serial to TCPIP connection could be used with games like cyberball.
retrogametech I bet it could be done.
retrogametech What happens if you answer?
retrogametech Well that escalated quickly
retrogametech In the central west we dont really get much. Its a bit too mild down here. It can get heavy at times but then its usually gone again within a day or 2. Compared to the north or colder countries its nothing. Its rare to get genuinely snowed in here :P
retrogametech Those damn United Kingdom people driving left P
retrogametech is this sped up? or are you hauling ass
retrogametech We are still having snow in Norway too.
retrogametech Looks like most of my early morning drives to work. I use both sides of the road.
retrogametech Instead of doing a mute footage you could coment while driving or afterwards in the edition, nonetheless cool video showing us the beatifull Scotland. Greetings from Portugal!
retrogametech Know this road well, think you must live near to me.
retrogametech Its not. The title is a play on words. The track featured in the video is called Risky Ride. Its from the driving game OutRun 2006.
retrogametech Hi RetroGameTech, I would like to ask if it is possible to reseat the ribbon cables just by unscrewing the top screen? I dont wish to mess with the motherboard at the bottom screen
retrogametech My buttons and my touch screen wont respond. And I have never spilled any liquids on my 3ds XL and I have a case to prevent damage if it fell. Anyone know what the problem could be?
retrogametech Can you make a video on how to replace a 3DS shell? I plan on doing a replacement but, Im not sure how to do so
retrogametech get a rubber band put it on the stripped screw and twist that bitch!
retrogametech can i buy one of the ds lites?
retrogametech oh and i got the 3ds for 30 delivered :D
retrogametech Nice one, very clever!
retrogametech That box is huge! My NTSC box is half that size!
retrogametech Help not working this my 3ds
retrogametech put ur channel back to normal!!!
retrogametech Not for the original NGage gamephone. Nokia kept and continued to use the NGage brand for its mobile games long after the Taco and QD were discontinued. It would most likely be a download only game released for one of their later smartphones.
retrogametech I myself am trying to get hold of a boxed console. You got any spare lol
retrogametech Ngage is in Tate mode?
retrogametech Now we all know that the NGage was a garbage phone and gaming system but that is an absolutely incredible collection. Hats off to you, sir. Congratulations
retrogametech Thanks. Yeah theres definitely some stinkers in there. It should be fun to do a few vids on them :)
retrogametech seriously, i didnt do anything
retrogametech Thats a pretty big task! Good luck! :)
retrogametech A white board... Pretty different to bog standard one
retrogametech That was the best thing that they ever did to it! But to be honest I do prefer the old analogs.
retrogametech At least theres not a couple decades worth of congealed sweat and grim to deal with! :P
retrogametech I might upgrade From my old controller to one of these.
retrogametech Ive been building and customizing 360 controllers for a few years now. Ive never seen an aftermarket casekit or controller that even came close to the quality of official Microsoft stuff. The build quality and feel are never quite right. With controllers youre always best sticking to official OEM.
retrogametech Look killer, mate! Original Xbox DPads were CRAP!
retrogametech Games looks great for how old it is.
retrogametech Ive always found the Street Fighter games a little too technical for me (I suck at them!). You really need to spend a lot of time with them to get anywhere. With DoA I find it a lot more accessible and fun.
retrogametech I remember playing this on my dreamcast. This version is faster and cleaner then the original. If anyone can get their hands on it. Never let it go
retrogametech I agree. The DC version does look better, and runs at a silkysmooth 60fps.
retrogametech Graphics still hold up really well
retrogametech I still have this game. Loved it back in the day. Not as good as Soul Calibre but great game. Graphics still look good now, but back then it was stunning as were most Dreamcast games.
retrogametech My favourite two youtubers :) Martin and Lukemorse!
retrogametech I cant believe you dont have a video capturing device, someone should send you one
retrogametech Thanks :) And yeah, Power Glove are pretty awesome :)
retrogametech Thanks dude! I dont think I left a comment, but I loved seeing you drive around snowy Finland a few months back. Great choice of music on that one! :)
retrogametech You adjust to it really quickly. Ive driven in countries where they drive on the right and it only takes minutes to adapt (or die! :P).
retrogametech Haha, wish I could capture something a cool as that!
retrogametech Ya, have you seen Worlds Dumbest Criminals? And i thought i laughed loud, bet the cops that watch the security footage laugh as well haha.
retrogametech wait for the meteorite itll happen someday. leave the dash cam on :D
retrogametech what kinda car do you drive lol? had to be asked
retrogametech would this work on a wonderswan mono?
retrogametech Alas, the original GBA cannot be modded to be backlit. You can, however, swap out its screen for a GBA SP AGS101 screen to have a backlit original GBA.
retrogametech the day after you made this video, I bought a gameboy on amazon for 25 worth 85 to me.
retrogametech How did you get sonic on the original gameboy?
retrogametech You need to bivert them.
retrogametech I highly doubt this is possible but, if you bought the backlight for the GameBoy original, and scraped off the back of it, could it be used as a frontlight?
retrogametech It certainly makes quite a positive impact on these.
retrogametech Nice mod!!! Looks too tricky for me, better seek out someone with good fine motor skills for pulling off that film!!
retrogametech Soooooo how much for a job like that??? I will pay!
retrogametech Very cool, Lovin the background music as well. Kept thinking of Jet Set Radio Future.
retrogametech Could you sell me one of these please???
retrogametech i love it  but i guess this mod will drain the batteries even faster now :D
retrogametech Lol, its funny you mention that. Keep an eye out for my next vid. Should be up very soon :)
retrogametech That is truly impressive. I dont think I have one VMU that still has working batteries.
retrogametech Thanks. Its not overly complicated, just really fiddly work :P
retrogametech Great little mod. Excellent idea.
retrogametech I have a stack of used PocketStations if you want to have a stab at modding one of those (free of course)
retrogametech Another cheep system for your collection, wish I was as adept at fixing electronics, well done fella.
retrogametech I know this is a strech, but.... AES FLASH CART.
retrogametech Thanks for the suggestions. Some more titles for me to add to the list and check out :)
retrogametech can i steal all your consoles please 00
retrogametech It looks like the console had a botched regionRGB mod attempted on it. Probably bought new and never played as a result. The UK version seems like a bit of an oddball system! its gimped in some ways and improved in others. Im looking forward to trying out some other games :)
retrogametech Seriously Id love to know where to get one that cheap, considering how rare they are.
retrogametech Were the specs of those 3machines pretty much the same? (I mean apart from the region and NTSC or PAL differences).
retrogametech Nope. NEC Supergrafx was PCE compatible but also had option of two hardware scrolling layers (like Sega MD) and twice as much Sprite pushing power as the PCE  128sprites (2 x 64 sprites  64 sprites for each layer) but only if software was programmed to utilise  Daimakaimura on SG is a PCE SG exclusive  not available on any other model PCE. Btw, Sega Megadrive had 80sprites over two layers, NeoGeo AES has 1000 ! over four layers) Sega Saturn is the best sprite pusher though :)
retrogametech RetroGameTech That Alien 3 game is on a cartridge using an nes emulator. The alien 3 is the same as alien 3 on regular nintendo.
retrogametech Awesome Seller Ive bought a few things of the last few months, sonic for a 1 Jap version is a BARGAIN
retrogametech It really is! :) One of the best games on the system I think.
retrogametech I am a huge fan of SEGA bootlegs too! Good finds!
retrogametech I have super puzzle fighter 2 on sega saturn, awesome game, i didnt pay a lot for it, its one of the later PAL games so it comes in a nice long box plastic case rather than the shite earlier cardboard glued to 2 trays. Aliens infestation on the Nintendo DS is a brilliant game look out for that.
retrogametech The white label discs are what the Dreamcasts nonretail review copies came on. Usually sent out to journalists before official release etc. Theyre legit. Its not a white sticker on the disc or anything like that, Its a professionally pressed GDROM. Some of them sell for a pretty penny!
retrogametech I think I have the North America release of that very Sega Tetris bootleg cart... same exact label art.
retrogametech ROCKET LAUNCHEEERRRRRR
retrogametech I like it! Cool idea but it is seams like you spent alot of time and money in to this project, excuse my ignorance but couldnt you have fit a micro SD port insted!?
retrogametech Hello how are you i have a game boy advance, Can you made one Flashcart For me ill buy it from you with the WILLEM PROGRAMMER to install Roms, Can you Do that for me !
retrogametech Thanks. Ive posted links in the description that have lots of info on the subject. Theres also a YouTuber called Gerry OBrien whos already done some pretty good tutorials on making flashcarts :) . I think a GBA version would probably be too expensive and complicated for me. Ill stick with my EZFlash for that system :P
retrogametech I can see why you want to make a reproduction cart of Shantae. Just had a quick look on ebay and the only listing on there is for a boxed, factory sealed and signed copy for 3100.00. Only 6.00 postage though. Bargain... :
retrogametech man you are getting a sub from me because when i found your channel recently before i was always searching for stuff like you to on youtube and it is in one big bundle :3
retrogametech what do you do for a living ?
retrogametech This is great for LSDJ! or nanoloop.
retrogametech Looks like youve saved yourself a lot of fun, soldering chips onto board only to find they are faulty ) Would be funny if you managed to find Shantae in a cheap buy it now listing. But failing that, making one yourself would certainly be a fun project.
retrogametech Hi, Would you sell one of those cartridges?
retrogametech why your gb god red buttons and mine got lige purpleish butons ?
retrogametech I wish you had actually shown a method for cleaning the battery terminals. I have an extra Game Boy where acid has leaked all over them. Ive done my best to clean them up letting them soak in baking soda and bleach. Then scrubbing them with a welders brush. But, I still cant get it to power on.
retrogametech Thanks for this! Just repaired the screen of a game boy I got at the boot fair for 3!Ive fitted a new screen cover too and cleaned it up, and its literally MINT now!!! :)
retrogametech The previous owner is no longer happy about the money he gained.
retrogametech Awesome, didnt know the screen issues were that easy to fix thanks!!!!
retrogametech i like all your videos.
retrogametech You just saved a lot of money!
retrogametech Very nice video. I do similar stuff.I have a GB laying around I forgot about and I didnt know how to fix the missing screen areas till I saw this. Good stuff.
retrogametech kiedy wzie do rki rubokrt to zrozumiaem e warto przeczy na HD i peny ekran.
retrogametech no it had to be changed because of false advertising
retrogametech I think Martin really likes you.
retrogametech why is text on the tape dutch?
retrogametech Did you enjoy the iron bru? Its a nice drink
retrogametech Cool present, love the pixel art and some tasty Scottish treats :)
retrogametech OMG watch out this package is a SUGAR BOMB OO awesome package from martin :D
retrogametech Liked before watching, luke has the best unboxing vids. Congrats on the gifts  merry christmas!
retrogametech Wow Love Iron Bru, I Havent had that since i was a Kid. Time to go to the shop to pick some upm:) Awesome Present
retrogametech Made from girders... lol Scotlands national soda pop
retrogametech thanks bro. Yeah, Martin is a great guy for sure and has a cool channel as well.
retrogametech I do and some of the smaller developers cant afford to released their games as physical retail copies. Games like Mighty Switch Force and Shantae RR are some of the best Ive played in recent years and are only available as DLC through eShop. There is good stuff on eShop.
retrogametech Its happening...we should have voted for Ron Paul...or is this in Europe somewhere?
retrogametech What a load of bull. Soon they will be limiting when you can play the games you have bought on your system...
retrogametech i agree its gotten out of hand and plus the few games you can download are watly to dear
retrogametech And that my friend is why Nintendo sucks
retrogametech Did you film this facing the wall just to get the Christmas tree in the background? Thats the holiday spirit!
retrogametech This is stupid. This is why Nintendo will never get any of my money via the eShop. This and the fact that downloads are linked to my system and not to my ID, so if my Wii dies I lose all my stuff. Ive had friends that have gotten screwed like this before. Nintendo seems to be the only one who thinks that only 7yearolds are still playing video games. Ridiculous. Hey Nintendo  its not 1982 anymore.
retrogametech Cheaptendo at their worst. I mean, it would be okay with parent control and all, but this just feels like a joke.
retrogametech ... I thought Nintendo was on the road to redemption when I saw the Wii U. I was sadly mistaken... RIP Nintendo
retrogametech Love it, Ive been meaning to buy an AGS101 for the longest time now and swap its guts into a black AGS001 I have. Like others in the comments I also vote for a tutorial on how to do this. :)
retrogametech You need to buy an AGS101 then gut your own console and transfer all the parts over. You cant upgrade a regular AGS001 unfortunately.
retrogametech Lol, thanks. I actually got both that blue and graphite SP in the same bundle for 20 :P
retrogametech I dont mind it, it looks good. Functionality wise it doesnt affect me much either. Ive always viewed new sub uploads from the my username tab in the top right corner. That seems to still be exactly as it was before. But I wish Google would stop switching things up so often! It always causes unnecessary drama.
retrogametech Loving it! Completed the first one then went straight onto the 2nd. Santa is bringing me the 3rd! :). Its been eating up pretty much all my gaming time the last couple months. Im doing all the side quests and talking to everyone. I was really lucky when I bought ME1 because the guy in Gamestation threw in an unused ME2 CE DLC card! I also bought most of the DLC for ME1  2. Im totally hooked on the story and love the epic scale and detail of the games universe. Its excellent!
retrogametech The Bruce Lee game cracks me up everytime XD .Its surprisingly good, definitely worth your time! I read that Mirrors Edge 2 is in development ) . Love that game! The music and art style totally draw you in.
retrogametech That Santa Claus game music for the GBC has that old school Codemasters NES music twang sound it...great stuff.
retrogametech You know that there is a Switchless mod for 5060Hz and Language? mmmonkeyDOTcoDOTukconsolesegamd1switchless.htm
retrogametech You would be the perfect DadBrother youd help fixmake anything :)
retrogametech I totally agree! I love the look of the first Mega Drive! :)
retrogametech Im a fan of how I installed the switches in my Mega Drive. I used slider switches like you did, but I used really small ones which fit perfectly (vertically) in the space between the EXT port and RF jack on the back. You can cant even see them, and regionlanguageswitching can easily be done by with just your index and middle fingers :D
retrogametech I have the mk 1 megadrive and still use the RF out
retrogametech I just make do with the cheapo 30W units from ebay. You can spend a lot more if you want precision control over temperature but the cheap units will also get the job done :)
retrogametech This reminds me, I have one of the early ones and the output is scrambled and glitchy, Im baffled by it. If I put up a video, can you have a look please? Itd be much appreciated mate. Thanks
retrogametech Those switches look pretty nice. I always thought those switches were just ONOFF not ONOFFON. I couldnt agree more with the RF out. Nobody should need to use that anymore so why not just use the space for something useful.
retrogametech liking the background music
retrogametech Martin, by MDF do you mean Medium Density Fibrewood because if you do, that is the best plan to give yourself cancer ever, MDF is carcenogenic.
retrogametech How Bout A GamecubeNES Fusion Console Mod. Its Been A Few Months Now.
retrogametech I was thinking the same thing, keeping the metal around the controller ports will be much stronger than the plastic and you could even sand and spray it black so you cant see it from the outside.
retrogametech why remove the metal from the controller ports? everything else sounds solid.
retrogametech Haha, one (actually probably several) of the many variations of KOF. I didnt notice it at first but one day I happened to glance at the background during a fight. Naked ladies all of the place!!! lol I cant remember the exact ROM but Im pretty sure theres a few like that, haha. I think Gamester81 mentioned it on a review he did of his MVS multicart a while back.
retrogametech I live in England, And HDMI cables are popular, but only on HD outputting systems. Scart is easy to use for console collectors as you can get large Scart adapters to plug about 3 Scart plugs in one plug, and you can daisy chain them to make them longer. Scart is also neater, as you dont have 35 separate wires, just one plug. So HDMI is popular, and Every single HD outputting product in my you has HDMI (Bluray players, PS3, Xbox ect).
retrogametech Looking good so far, keep up the good work. One day i hope to build my own console.
retrogametech MDF is a low risk material IMO. The dust poses a health risk but this is true of most wood based building materials. Its the formaldehyde resins used in MDF that people have concerns about. However, wearing a dust mask and working in a ventilated area should be more than enough to keep you safe. Ive worked with MDF for years, Im not concerned. I bet a lot of the furniture and units in your homeschoolcollegework are made out of MDF :P
retrogametech Great vid as always, and what a great project. Cant wait to see this finished.
retrogametech The earlier revisions of Dreamcast had large metal heatsinks, heat pipes and metal fan housings. They were more commonly found in Japanese systems but they were released in all regions. VA0 is the motherboard version you are looking for.
retrogametech To repair it, mod it, clean it or maybe just for fun to see how it works and whats inside. Same reasons youd take anything apart. :P
retrogametech Think youre up for the challenge, Ed? :P
retrogametech hi thanks for getting back to me . i will try what you have said. look forward to watching the Saturn video when you put it up. thanks again. regards Steve.
retrogametech Very good video and well done so that people can pause it at stages to make the tear down easy.
retrogametech they way it should be...
retrogametech Once again, another fascinating video...thanks brother!
retrogametech hi great video of the strip down of the dream cast. will you be doing a video of a Saturn strip down and an av mod. as i have a Saturn which as a faulty TV connection . if i wiggle the lead color on game gos all wiered. thanks regards Steve.
retrogametech If you ever need help getting partnered dude, let me know! You could use the money for future projects! But that Sega Classics collection, the buggers removed Alien Syndrome from the PAL version to lower the age rating .
retrogametech i was going to do the snap shot but had 0 time i think i made 6 attempts at doing a video
retrogametech I got a reply :D Thank you :)
retrogametech Why dont you monetize your videos...you fool. On a serious note...you should offer your services or some kind of merchandise so we can help support your habits. :D
retrogametech I really like the Golden Axe remake! Its so cheesy! XD
retrogametech congrats too on 10k subs and the last n gage game!!
retrogametech Thanks you! :) Just need that copy of Sega Rally! :P
retrogametech XD that do sound up like a mashup of steps and venga boys
retrogametech you sir are a master of electronic trickery.
retrogametech Good job mate, excellent stuff!
retrogametech Will this be more or less the same with the XL?
retrogametech Lol, something like that :P
retrogametech Awesome... (Also, I need to work on my soldering skills so that I can do this replacement easily.) Theres this guy in my local chinatown that repairs and resolders old and new consoles. He always has a few 3DSes. :D
retrogametech If you mean the cartridge slot, imagine youre 3DS laying on the table, someone spills some water or something, and it flows into the slot.
retrogametech Great video, nicely detailed :)
retrogametech Thats pretty cool :) . Im glad you got some use out of my channel!
retrogametech nice video retrogametech. Also whats your progress on your faulty R4s?
retrogametech Thanks man! Glad you like it :D and I certainly am from the UK :)
retrogametech love your behind scenes videos.
retrogametech Very cool video as always.
retrogametech nice setup, Lukester. I installed homebrew on my wii and now play NES, MAME, Turbo Grafx16, SEga Gensis, SMS, and SNES games on it through emulation. Freaking love it, and it saves a lot of room from all those consoles. Great setup...oh, JAPAN!!!!
retrogametech Really appreciate you taking the time to do a video response dude! Ive been having a hard time keeping up with all the comments and new people checking out my channel! haha I dont think I remember seeing one of those DuoR systems before. Ill need to check that out. Thanks again Luke!
retrogametech Excellent response vid. I havent done any mods to my systems yet, but you never know when I might try my hands on the modding business. Love Retrogametechs repair and mod videos.
retrogametech Dude, quick question, i have a dreamcast keyboard in MINT condition, boxed, with the plastic bag it was inside in the box if you are interested?
retrogametech Good to see a fellow piratecollector... Just because you have backups doesnt mean you dont buy legit stuff too. Im seriously running out of space.
retrogametech Far from it. He pays for his stuff by buying faulty consoles and repairing and selling them on again. Its a self supporting hobby.
retrogametech MD is still here, that is going NO WHERE! Unless the hou... no I am not finishing that sentence. The SMS is gone, and the broken DC is a footrest. Its all its good for.
retrogametech yes! please! im such a huge fan and it would be so great!!!
retrogametech I love your channel especially your ebay junk videos
retrogametech If you ever have a fire Im pretty sure I know where it started.
retrogametech Cool collection, I have my Gamecube, Atari Jaguar, Turbografx, Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, 3DO FZ1, Saturn Model 2, Sega Mega Drive  Mega CD Model 1, and my Super Nintendo hooked up to my small TV. While on my big TV, I have a PS3, Xbox 360, and WiiU hooked up. I also have a few in storage, my Xbox (original), PS2, Amiga CD32, PSone, Saturn Model 1, and Mega Drive Model 2.
retrogametech You could always hide the faulty ones in the dashboard of an abandoned derilict Ford Escort.
retrogametech Am i the only one who sees the irony in calling a flash cart, which Nintendo do all they can to stop being produced, official? lol
retrogametech No, the fake R4s have the bump where the sticker covers the flash chip.
retrogametech very nice man, im sure youll get a bit more going for sure. nice pick ups
retrogametech Just wondering, how long are you searching at ebay every day for deals like this? This is pretty sick!
retrogametech Sounds good hope to see more mods like that pretty soon. Did you hear about the 360 mod that lets you make a 360 receiver for window pc games?
retrogametech Try using Wood firmware! It should be compatiate with almost all of them.
retrogametech If only there was one for 3ds D:
retrogametech Awesome haul, great video as always.
retrogametech Lol I got this but for gameboy advance
retrogametech What Do You Aspect The Music To Be? From A Gameboy?
retrogametech you can use supergameboy, so recording will be easier.
retrogametech Its the intro music to Sonic  Knuckles from MegaDrive.... HORRIBLY BUTCHERED!
retrogametech Thanks for watching! :)
retrogametech where do you get all your broken consoles from ? not apt for this video but i keep forgetting to ask lol
retrogametech thank god you told me that, it was genuinely doing my head in!
retrogametech Theres nothing wrong with 8 bit music, it brings back memories for me also, but not that. Its hardly musical.
retrogametech Sonic 3D Blast 5 lmao..
retrogametech Why dont u work with GameCube
retrogametech The lime green DSl is nice man, I saw one recently and wanted to get it, just for the colour :P
retrogametech Music detail in the description :)
retrogametech Cheers, Rob! From memory Deadlight is supposed to be 5 hours long (I think). Pretty sure I finished it in about 23 sittings. Its not massively long but some parts can be really tricky and require multiple attempts. I loved it and Im going back to 100 it and find all the collectables etc. Perfect game for Halloween! :P
retrogametech In the past I ended up selling my videogame items !
retrogametech Le Joker Dans Toute Sa Splendeur
retrogametech How do you find out these faults, do you just take a chance buying these broken units?
retrogametech Spilled liquid? It always boggles my mind how careless some people are with expensive toys like these. Granted, many of these DSs were owned by children, but I cant believe how irresponsible some are with their video games! Back in my day at the mere age of 8 I protected my Game Boy like my baby!
retrogametech Was just wondering as I have a C64, Super Famicom and orig gameboy that could use it... but have you tried makingusing Retr0bright? Ive heard of people having really good luck with it and other completely destroying their shit.
retrogametech wow that is awesome! i wish i was smart enough to do this...lol Cheers Martin
retrogametech Bloody brilliant, man ) Definitely adding this to my list of future projects. lol
retrogametech Nice job Martin :) 4.0 Amps should be more than enough. I used 3.0 Amps on my all in one Sega fusion console, been working great so far. Great video!
retrogametech Now you need two more for Saturn and Dreamcast
retrogametech Do you have a brand and model number for one of those power supplies please?
retrogametech SOOOOO MANY WIRES! lol
retrogametech Nicely done! Ive been hounding the internet for a Sega power supply that doesnt have that massive fat plug head, its an absolute pain plugging it into my setup because I have to disconnect two plugs rather than one. I have yet to find one though :(
retrogametech i am from America and i was wondering if you could tell me what Dragons den is please.
retrogametech Man that does sound really good but I would worry about causing a fire having all of those branched connections inside that cig lighter adapter.
retrogametech Did you ever finish this project? :)
retrogametech for some reason this video did not appear on my sub box, thats weird this bug hasnt happened for a long time...
retrogametech Thanks dude! Its nice to finally get to mess around with some of those games1 XD
retrogametech Cant wait too see it running, are you gonna build a case?
retrogametech Its a slippery slope son, and you are already skidding :)
retrogametech Yeah the power supply I use is pretty small. ill pm you the website and product number so you can check it out.
retrogametech This is going to be really cool. I look forward to seeing the final product. Good luck man!
retrogametech i expected it to be a fighting game. like the one on the saturn.
retrogametech Nintendo has secured there code better. The reason it is harder to dump a pirate game is because Nintendos protection for GBA is the same for every game. The pirate games, however, are probably 35 games of the same encryption. Tons of people tried to break Nintendos protection, but no one bothered to figure out how to copy the obscure, unlicensed titles. P.S. The download link doesnt work at this time
retrogametech So a bootleg game wont run on a bootleg console? :)
retrogametech you cant even force me to play that crap!
retrogametech I always look forward to watching the latest RGT vid.
retrogametech I dont think its encrypted or has copy protection or anything like that, I think its just stored in a different way which the dumping software doesnt know how to read, which would explain why it just dumps an empty file. Ive got a fake Pokemon Emerald that does the same thing.
retrogametech Sorry, Larry. I find it really difficult to manage both my PM inbox and respond to the comments people leave on my vids. I try to respond to everyone but unfortunately I just dont have the time. Comments left on my vids always take priority since theyre public and any useful info that gets exchanged can be viewed, shared and added to by everyone in the community. My PM inbox doesnt get so much attention but I do go through it every few weeks and respond to what I can when I find time.
retrogametech KITT171 get outtatown!!! this was garbage! play sonic generations....its excellent :)
retrogametech My cord is broken similar to yours. How did you soder the wires. I tryed and the wires rem to just melt.
retrogametech WOW!! Those are expensive!!! Nice fix!!!!
retrogametech As I was watching the video I looked over at my Xbox and it had the red dot of death
retrogametech How Madonna is that mic.
retrogametech my fucking trittons broke. sounds doesnt travel through the cord so i cant hear shit
retrogametech where did you buy the tritton??
retrogametech Odd. That looks like the same mess I had on a bad SNES board. The games played but there was too much color mixingcolors missing going on.
retrogametech Most of the time, the devices are low voltage dc. If youre doing testing, make sure the board is sitting on something bare with no metal near it such as a cardboard pad or something like a rubber or silicon mat. Avoid touching the boards themselves while they are on while testing. Very simple common sense things will help you avoid getting shocked, but again, hes dealing with low voltage items usually.
retrogametech SETTING UP THE HARD DIP SETTING UP THE SOFT DIP
retrogametech Best of luck to you man, the neo geos are a bitch to get working, especially the AVS. And hey if you cant get it to work, your could probably send it to LukeMorse from japan. he is pretty good at fixing neo geos
retrogametech I installed a CR2032 on my Pokemon silver cartridge. I considered a battery holder, but again, I wasnt really satisfied that I had to keep using such a small battery. I just guessed that a larger battery would keep my save file for longer. I mean, same voltage, twice the size, thus much bigger capacity. If the original battery kept my save file for about 11 years, the the new one should hit the 1520 years mark quite easily.What I did was to cut the old battery from its metal pins, and simple placed the new, larger battery on those pins. I didnt use solder, as the cartridge case alone (when closed) aplied enough pressure on it to keep it in place. I did use one small strip of electric tape to keep the larger battery contacts away from the cartridge PCB, though. As I said before, its a tight fit, the cartridge kinda get a little bulkier where the new battery is, about 1mm, but that doesnt do any damage to the cartridge case or the gameboy. It still slides easily into any Gameboy related product without ploblems, and its been working fine until now. (and Ive done this mod about 2 years ago) )
retrogametech Pokmon uses batteries.
retrogametech Haha, thanks dude. Its the one thing that really bugs me about YouTube. It doesnt matter how much research you do, how careful you are to cover your bases or how many times youve rerecorded a video to make sure you mention something youd previously forgotten, theres always someone who seemingly just cant wait to nitpick and criticise. Either that or just post misinformation to try and discredit what youve done. You cant please everyone :P
retrogametech Do you need a lot of money to invest in your hobby? I really enjoy electronics and I enjoy retro gaming and gaming in general even more so. Currently I have a Wii, a PS1, a Xbox 360 Slim, a Gamecube, a DS Lite and a crazy amount of games for consoles I dont have. (PSP, Snes, Nes, Master System, Saturn, all those old consoles.)
retrogametech No, the carts appear to retain a charge for several seconds (possibly 1020). I switched the battery in my copy of Xtreme Sports while testing out this mod and was surprised to see my save was still selectable the next time I booted the game. So you should have enough time to quickly take out an old battery and fit a new one without losing data.
retrogametech Haha Larry. Glad to see youre giving support to awesome people doing awesome stuff like this.
retrogametech I really dont get how people can enjoy emulation. They must have never owned the systems when they came out (gbc isnt that old but im talking all systems). Its all about nostalgia and playing the games on the actual hardware to me. Its like playing on a modern TV , play the games on a good CRT, people throw perfect ones away you can get them for free. Just my opinion, you can play on an emulator if you are into that weird stuff :D
retrogametech o forgot to ask would this work on original gameboy games. If not is there a smaller version of the holder.
retrogametech Excllent tip! When you metioned the battery that you used, I thought to myself I wonder how many people will criticise this because of the shorter battery life?. People are so predictable.
retrogametech you wanna sold some these MODD XBOX ? heeheh
retrogametech 200sex. Tee hee I know its the accent but its kinda funny. (no offence!)
retrogametech Excellent haul, man, but you know, I like what you did with yours better. Buttons are great and all, but dip switches have a great charm all by themselves.
retrogametech It can mean the same thing. If the hard drive isnt working correctly or it failed while unlocked then the Xbox will throw out error code 5.
retrogametech I remember getting that same clear System for my brother awhile back. It wasnts modded though. A really cool system! Im glad you were able to get the system as nonworking a great deal!
retrogametech My modded Xbox has the same case cool.
retrogametech Haha, thats what I thought. Its been so long since I messed around with anything X3 related. I notice the dip switch panel on my own box has a little protect dip too. Memories coming back now! :P It wasnt explicitly listed as modded and to be fair it was only up for a couple of minutes before I snagged it :P . Suppose it just slipped through the net. Kinda lucky! I see you have a couple of these in black? Do you still use yours much?
retrogametech I still have mine with all this on it too, but mine is blue and has a custom Halo Legendary Elite skull center jewel with LEDs, i never use it, thought about selling it many times but glad i keep it :)
retrogametech The draw sticks on mine as well .Nice buy my sister chucked her modded xbox out when it stopped reading disk i should have saved it i do have all the baclup games from it.
retrogametech Haha, thanks dude! Just got done watching Lukes vid on the Unibios. Definitely going to pick one up as the next step. Im really interested to see how yours will react when you test with Unibios and the missing RAM. With mine Id just like to get it to show anything on screen. Even an error message would be nice! lol I was interested to read about the GenMega similarities too. Someone told me I could even use a Z80 from a model 1 Mega Drive. Ill still need to find a YM2610 though.
retrogametech Did you ever get this working? Ive done a recent repair to an MV1FZ but luckily I didnt have any battery acid  that stuff is really painful... I suspect you could have damaged tracks under the components nearby, it often doesnt stop just at the battery area and can damage the tracks underneath chips easily.
retrogametech good vid dude ! always worth a watch !
retrogametech Maybe there is a trace coroded under the DIPIC beside the Battery. The acid seems to like to spread underneath parts unfortunately.
retrogametech I would imagine the PCB could be multilayer board so you might not see all the corroded traces inside the board. Challenging project it seems. Good luck!
retrogametech This is awesome, I was thinking on this days ago, its nice to know that actually it existed, but I wish I could have them in hands.
retrogametech Lol, thats a good question!
retrogametech He got this one from Ebay, he said it at the start of the video. There is a video on the other one he has and I think he mentioned where he got that one from as well.
retrogametech No, it was actually pretty cheap! I paid around 8 total. And Id just sold a 3DS game I didnt like so had spare credit sitting in my PayPal. So technically it was free :P
retrogametech Irony is the cord on them little pads is longer than the cords on my real pads :P
retrogametech Yeah there was a Nintendo History Collection set very much in the same way as these. Fortunately I managed to get them when Playasia was still selling them a few years back. However Im still kicking myself that I never managed to get the Sega collection lol.
retrogametech I want to tease you and call you a nerd, but Id be lying if I said I didnt want them too:) Oh know, now you need to get another one to display with the Power Base Converter. Was that genuine excitement in your voice when you snapped the Mega Drive and Mega CD together? I like the forced perspective view at the end.
retrogametech Damn it!... you got me! :P But dont pretend like you wouldnt do the same!
retrogametech Very cool, I have the mini version of the famicom and some games with boxes, its pretty neat
retrogametech Lucky you! I wish the AES wasnt so expensive! :P
retrogametech Someone was nice enough to send me a busted one for nothing, Kenn6265. It can be brought back from the dead though. I need to find and replace the burned out ic and replace the missing LED. I made a big special video about it and its a rare Korean one! Since all SNK hardware is region free it doesnt matter, and it uses Japanese, or US BIOS I dont know yet since I cant turn it on. I wish I lived near you, I would pay to to fix it for me lol. I have wanted one all my life. Youll get one :)
retrogametech For the broken track either link it from the via to the chip pin on the bottom of the pcb or scratch off the solder resist from the track to expose it, then run a single core link wire across the break and paint on some new resist (total track replacement repair).
retrogametech Good stuff man. I myself have a AES I need to start working on, someday.
retrogametech I have those exact same 3d glasses, but they do NOT work as well as the OEM SEGA glasses, which I also have. I found that the 3D effect is not as good, that you still get some of the double vision that you get wearing no glasses.
retrogametech Awesome!! Love master system!!!
retrogametech Your videos are great :D glad you putting out more videos oh and you have not seem to have updated your backloggery
retrogametech Unfortunately those arent LCD shutter glasses. Theyre the passive polarised type and wont work with the Master System.
retrogametech Cool, Will have to try and track down a 3D adapter and dig out my MS1.
retrogametech Let me ask for the people that have these 3d games. Is worth the investment ?or are there more of a novelty??? What gamegames are worth it?
retrogametech Its not that I didnt listen to the suggestions, Its more that I can really afford to undertake a project like that right now. I just went with the cheapest option to restore it to its original working state. The other problem would be dismantling it to fit a photo screen inside. The way its constructed means it would near enough have to be destroyed to gain access. These things were never meant to be serviced so opening them up isnt really an option without damaging it.
retrogametech Just search ebay or amazon for CCFL kit and you should see a bunch of options. You can get all sorts of sizes and colours etc.
retrogametech Bummer, that always to me. Just when I think Ive got it, I break it. I didnt think there was any chance you would be able to get those tubes in there. It looks nice, but where the heck would you display something like that?
retrogametech Yeah but its the kinda thing you wouldnt think would be an issue until you actually got around to fitting. The tubes I bought are identical in size to what was already in there. I just assumed there wouldnt be a problem in a direct replacement. Will keep those shorter tubes in mind for next time though )
retrogametech They can, but they do it by detecting if its a GBA Cartridge or a GBGBC Cartridge. Since this is a GBA Cartridge, it goes into GBA Mode and only plays GBA ROMs. If this was a GBGBC Cartridge, it would go into GBGBC Mode, and would only play GBGBC ROMs.
retrogametech Does this mean if I have already patched mother 3 in English that I could actually really play it on my GBA instead of an emulator?
retrogametech If memory servers correctly down by the cartage contacts there is a little switch that gets hit when you put in a normal Game Boy game, when a GBA game is put in the switch is not pushed down and the system goes in to GBA mode. I wonder if you could put in a ROM for a normal Game Boy and have something push the little switch down to make the GBA start in GB mode.
retrogametech You know Martin, you can play game boy and game boy color games using Goomba and Goomba color. They work fine for me, and if you are having trouble with it, check out wildwolfGs tutorial. Also, you can find a EZflash iv at the realhotstuff for  3035.
retrogametech managed to add some cheats to the games? if not, check out gbaatm.
retrogametech Is there a device for a Sega Megadrive which works the same way?
retrogametech What is going on with that Xbox in the background and where can I get one please.
GameSack Dear Game Sack ....hiThat is all xoxoxo
GameSack Have fun. Check the back seat for Sonic before you go. Maybe under the car too.
GameSack Sounds legit! I might have to check it out this year! Would be fun to talk to some other fun to talk to people!! Yeah... lol
GameSack Joe please bring Neo Turf Masters on the AES for me!!! Thanks man!!!
GameSack Pretty sure The Game Chasers put on Retropalooza right?
GameSack Wish I could be at these things. Awesome you guys are finally doing one.
GameSack You and Boogie are my favs!
GameSack Great, Make Video about it, It will be amazing!
GameSack Another great episode. Nice work guys.
GameSack So jealous you have SVC Chaos on the AES. I just ordered it for the original XBOX today. Thats the real Capcom vs SNK that I think a lot of fans dont know exists. I dont understand why it hasnt been released digitally.
GameSack I always choose the offensive orgy. ALWAYS. HA Great episode guys!
GameSack cant stop. watching. this channel. too much. awesome.
GameSack Awesome episode guys! I own a Neo Geo CD but I really wish I owned a regular Neo Geo. The load times are horrendous on my model!
GameSack OMG a Night Trap T shirt! drool
GameSack One system that I hope you cover in the future is the MSX I havent played it but I heard that it has a lot of great games that never came out on any other systems, especially by Konami.
GameSack 1000s of dollars my ass i got aes neogeo n all my games i for for like 4050 bujks a cartridge bak in day at game crazy in hollywood video and every time i go to retro expos in seattle i find most caerridges for like 100 buks so u saying 1000 dollars is pure bs n here say lol
GameSack Man, I always love those postcredit gags.
GameSack sweet Golden Axe shirt Dave!
GameSack You were able to point out the loading times on Last Blade in quite an amusing way.The skit at the end was priceless as well. Hope to see more, as with the X68000 comp as well!
GameSack Wow, their acting actually improved. I remember playing Samurai Spirits 2 at a supermarket while my parents were shopping. And also when the store simply pulled it away because of the increasing number of children going there only to play for free.
GameSack Savage Reign looks insane, looked it up and it is on the Fun Super Combo Ps2 game released in Japan, so I actually have a chance to play it! Thanks Game Sack!
GameSack 29:40 I got a story. Ahem! Today...I will tell you the story of the ThousandYearloading endsOh hey! The games ready!
GameSack Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten at 5:15
GameSack well i guess in the usa no one pees, i think thats because in usa men doesnt have pennis mmm.. now i get it...
GameSack You should make an episode about games with balls in them like Super Monkey Ball, Marble Madness etc. and call the episode Ball sack instead of Game sack.
GameSack Just subbed. Gonna help you hit 15k!
GameSack Great episode as always, I have played all of these games. JK ), I have played about 5 of them total I think. Magical Popn is definitely my favorite from this list, epic game.
GameSack Question: what setup do you use for recording Sega Saturn footage?
GameSack Another classic video! I keep on discovering new stuff thanks to you both!
GameSack For Left in Japan 6, Transformers for Famicom? Ill be impressed if you guys can make it past the first level.
GameSack wow you really did blast that girls top off. Thanks for putting these games on my radar.
GameSack I hate bunjie now they dont seem to give a shit that they just abandoned halo their masterpiece , to turn to shit and they just go make Destiny which just looks like boarderlands (but more serious)
GameSack Whens the beta again?
GameSack How do you get so good at getting user picks?
GameSack I trying to save up for a free safety and i cant decide between 94 jairus byrd or 95 weddle which one should i pick up?
GameSack I never want to see this again
GameSack AAAND THE OSCAR GOES TOOOO  GAMESACK!!! xDDD
GameSack I thought this was YouTube, not YouPorn?!?!Great video guys, very funny! The PlayStations cum face was a little off putting though, hehehe
GameSack Wait w wh a what di did I just? Did I just watch console porn?( I kid, I kid xD)
GameSack Can definitely see the continuing quality in your stopmotion skits youve done in a few of the episodes and other things youve posted. Keep it up! Really dig it.
GameSack This is really perverted plastic on plastic awesome camera work
GameSack 5k resolution what are they taking about?
GameSack Those sound effects are so stock, I feel like Im watching a promotion video for some source site.
GameSack Nice run! By the way, toward the end of the video, the gameplay audio got way out of sync.
GameSack Damn nooo final fantasy vii!
GameSack they overlap but the PS1 was the first of the new generation and the DC was the last of the old generation. sony changed everything when they got involved and sega changed everything when they dropped out.
GameSack God the PS1 is such a kickass system! So many great games
GameSack I cant believe I didnt play some of these as a kid. They look great.
GameSack its adventurerpg hybrid alundra theese guys really dont there genres or games there biost against final fantasy resident evil n silent hill n parasie eve seris i hate biost reviewrs there so biost its like watchin xplay again lol
GameSack I just stood it on its side
GameSack ALICARD? Just....why?
GameSack Parrappa is the worst game ever, besides is extremely stupid. (I dont care if i spelled the name wrong)
GameSack My favorite games are for the PlayStationMedal of HonorGame of LifeMetal Gear SolidGTA 2DriverTomb RaiderGran Turismo 2Tiger Woods PGA Tour GolfWipeoutGexPizza Hut Demo Disks
GameSack Man I love Vector Man! I think it failed becuase at was launched at the on consoles lifecycle. But I like the music and graphics. I dont mind for the poligonal design, actually vector man got in top ten s favorites for Sonic Transformed petitions! And well, I dont know how much success got Captain Commando in US, but everyone liked it in Costa Rica! I actually know other latinamerican fellas tat like it... But still, you guys are right, both are failed mascots
GameSack Great video! Been enjoying old forgotten titles lately. Just a tidbit of info on ChibiRobo I have actually never played it but if anyone thought it looked interesting I want to point out that I read that at FIRST the game is merely doing chores... But eventually something (no spoilers) happens that forces Chibi to set up traps and avoid ones set up for him while still obeying his program ans cleaning things up. If you enjoyed the first Pikmin I have a hunch ChibiRobo might be just the game someone wanted! Plus its cheap on ebay usually! This video convinced me to subscribe! I love the narration.
GameSack You didnt mention Claw :)
GameSack Punki Skunk is so cute!
GameSack chibi robo is awesome
GameSack OH! Ive played Croc on PS2!!
GameSack Ristar and Gex! Crash Bandicoot has some success too.
GameSack Master Higgins and Wonder boy
GameSack Not all of these are mascots.
GameSack Hier mchte ich euch in kurzer Humoristischer Form einen meiner Lieblingskanle vorstellen. :)
GameSack Wheres me my sanic? WHERES ME MY SANIC!? I join thejobloshow.
GameSack My favorite YouTube channel congrats thanks for the many good looks at many great and fairly decent games and systems
GameSack I cant believe people are complaining about the intro, its incredible! So well edited. Heres to another 100 episodes :D
GameSack I have Road Rash in my top 5 favorite 16bit games, I even bought the EA Replay for PSP just to play Road Rash on the go, but sadly the original music isnt there on the PSP version.
GameSack Great show guys! Really enjoyed the special intro! Interesting choices in the list. Surprised there was no version of Street Fighter II on either list but the 1 on 1 fighting genre doesnt seem to really be the top choice for either of you guys.
GameSack This is the craziest top ten ive ever seen!
GameSack Ive never beaten Super Castlevania 4!
GameSack I think its interesting that you use the term Welcoming to your doom at 27:28. Theres a character oddly enough that looks like the same one from Altered Beast that says Welcome to your doom!
GameSack 1:24 1:47 thats one big sack
GameSack In strip fighter you win a fight than quickly got to fap fap fap...
GameSack Oh my god, why is Gosunkugi fighting against Akane???
GameSack kensei sacred fist ps one, and fightermaker one. :) fatal fury wild ambition.
GameSack No Weaponlord? That was a fun SNES game, though a bit sluggish at times. And yes, there is also a Genesis port.
GameSack Where the fuck is King of Fighters?
GameSack only killer instinct is good all other games are shit
GameSack I feel like by the time TMNT Tourney Fighters came out, the Turtles popularity had waned
GameSack There was a halfway descent fighting game for the SNES  SFC called Ultimate Fighter (or Hiryuu No Ken in Japan). Its part side scroller  part fighting game. Another half way descent game was Deadly Moves for the Sega Genesis. The main mode you were limited to only playing as the main character (Joe), but in Vs Mode, you could choose to play as the others. I never played Power Moves for the SNES, but I understand it was the same game with a different name.I also liked playing Clay Fighter  Killer Instinct. I managed to kill some time playing Eternal Champions. I have always thought of it as a poor mans Street Fighter 2 game. Im surprised you didnt mention the fact that your special moves were limited by the amount of inner strength you had  that when you insult your opponent, it drains their inner strength. That to me is what made E.C. so difficult to play. Xavier was my favorite character because he could change opponents into other characters.
GameSack Where the fuck is Fatal Fury...?You do not know a fuck.
GameSack I had more fun watching this than the real Superbowl, cause the Broncos actually put up a fight against the Seahawks. :PBut no offence though, this was nice to watch. :)
GameSack Guys, Id love to see you play the arcade game of Asterix, which was released here in Europe. Its a scrolling beatemup by Konami, masters of the genre. I know youd love it.
GameSack great episode! nice choose of arcade games!, arcade hidden gems..
GameSack Blood Bros. kinda reminds me of Wild Guns.
GameSack Loved the episode...until you ripped on Klax at the end!!! :)
GameSack Thanks Game Sack. How bout those Broncos? Lol
GameSack Sorry... Some of the games were too bloody for me... X(
GameSack Another great video. Keep up the good work.
GameSack Where do you guys get all your cool shirts? Do you Make them? Do you buy them? If so, where?
GameSack Check out Shadow Force. It looks like a good beat em up.
GameSack i dont like sunny days either xD
GameSack The series thing is a really great idea man! Go for it. If you need any ideas on the setup let me know....I already have stuff in mind
GameSack I hate the map for husky raid. It always turns into binary rifle spawn camping from across the map
GameSack This whole competitive gaming YouTuber plus semiMLG dude thing would definitely be interesting in the way of seeing who gets on this show you know. Gameplaywise, Ive never been a fan of extremely competitive games because of how little action takes place. Nade throws all the time running for cover. I know these are essential, I just hope that you, as a really good youtuber w great ideas, will be able to bring something new to the table in a sense that it will be entertaining to watch. Also if these gameplays were on DLC maps(monolith, skyline the small maps) it would be even more interesting to watch because of the map chemistry. Im not saying forge maps are a step backward, Im just saying that there isnt much variety in the way that forge maps play out e.g. Sniper Rifle is the only power weapon for says. If you control that, youre gonna dominate and it isnt gg to be interesting you know what I mean? Anyways, thanks for the vid. Great gameplay.
GameSack 23:23 HOLD ON A SEC !!! Was that a Black TWINBEE ?
GameSack 3000? (that would have been what, 2000?!) I can see why it was Japan only, no way would it have competed with Atari STs (which had a builtin MIDI interface if not an actual synth) or Commodore Amigas at a quarter of the price (at most) in the UK, yeah it matched the Amiga 2000 for price but we had the A500 and even the Archimedes was cheaper. Though I bet if it was launched in the UK, Cumana would have sold external 5.25 drives for the X68030 (or 3.5 drives)X68K Star Wars very much like the Atari Coin Op. Japan gets Mad Stalker, the rest of us get Rise Of The Sodding RobotsThe music on X68K is second to none, it basically is arcade hardware from the late 80s early 90s, much more powerful than the competition, 80 shoot em ups are a waste of the system though.
GameSack Awesome ending!! I laughted a lot!
GameSack Cool episode guys! Where did you guys get your X68000? Because its definitely something Id like to pick up!
GameSack Good ep. Very informative!
GameSack I was wondering if you guys could do an episode about graphically impressive games? I really would like to see what skilled programmers managed to pull of.
GameSack Super mario Special is on the sharp x68000 i think
GameSack Your videos are simply awesome! This is the best video ive seen regarding the X68000. I was wondering though, do you actually own all the X68000 systems that were shown in this video, or were they just on loan? And Thank You for making the best game show on youtube. I hope it continues on for many years!
GameSack turn that jerk off was probably not the best choice of words, tobias.
GameSack But fido dido was released... i played it...
GameSack That Jellyboysmartball thing remind me of Mr. Gimmick by Sunsoft for the NES for some reason. Might be getting it as I loved Gimmick.
GameSack LOL good to know a few people still remember the Richard Gere Gerbil legend.
GameSack How dare you make a video about unreleased games without talking about Eon Man: Time Diver and Star Fox 2?
GameSack May I suggest a little gem called Secret Ties for the NESInteresting gameplay style with a soundtrack thats really good
GameSack Project Offset and starcraft ghost
GameSack Gradius III music in the first 55 seconds :)
GameSack lmfao Be Different. Thanks for the great episode guys
GameSack Do you guys ever use your video game powers to get laid?
GameSack WWF BACKLASH FOR N 64
GameSack AL UR BACE AR BELONG TO US
GameSack dude you guys should play with me my gamertag for xbox 360 is Elitesolider813
GameSack omg i just realized that joven was on king of the nerds i love that show i wish joven won though.
GameSack All your base are belong to us... HAHAHAHAHAHAHhahahahahaaaa....I love it when I finally get a Smosh games reference joke.
GameSack Enjoy GTA V?! Then check out our channel and help us grow!!
GameSack Could you guys make so more video for every week?

GameSack Do fucking gta 5 funny moments
GameSack Sohinki: I ran into a hotdog stand Joven: Was it reinforced? Hahahalol
GameSack If any smosh games people have xbox live im butterninja112
GameSack 3rd is the one with the hairy chest
GameSack 11:06 Shinobi III  SNES???? i think joe was very obsesced using the RetroGen adapter hehe!
GameSack Radical Pyscho Machines
GameSack Hehe! Funny episode. I especially liked the part where Joe had that tower of extensions.
GameSack Whats the music playing at 7:39? Its so familiar but I cant remember its name.
GameSack How did the leaning tower of swaying power no snap anything I kept going OO as it kept getting bigger and taller and swayed further!
GameSack awesome video!The portable Sonic Tower was funny.Also,really amazing to see Genesis games running on SNES.
GameSack One of your best reviews, thx guys!
GameSack Ive been subscribed to Gamesack for a long time and I generally find this show quite entertaining... But this is probably my favorite episode so far, especially the bit at 4:50 :)
GameSack hahahahah!! daves face when joe says hes the best of the duo made my day
GameSack Amazing episode! I didnt even realize that Episodes II and III of Shining Force III were translated. There are so many awesome games covered in this episode. Thank You!
GameSack Where did u fing that turbografx 16 microsd card adapter?.
GameSack On some of your game footage theres a really high pitched sound that hurts my sensitive ears for some reason. Its a bit annoying, and I guess theres nothing to do about it.
GameSack 14:02  Theme song from Cheetahmen!
GameSack so cool guys you should definitely make more of these episodes I recommend the dreamcast for homebrew as it has a thriving community and plenty of awesome games made by that community.
GameSack In terms of hacks, Im surprised you didnt cover the SSBB mod Project M.
GameSack Theres hacks of Sonic 2 and Sonic CD where theyve added the homing attack. Its a ton of fun annihilating everything. But it does take skill, you cant just spam it, otherwise you could launch yourself into spikes, pits, or enemies.
GameSack heres two (2) great super Nintendo hacks the legend of zelda parallel worlds: you can get reproduction carts of this game and chrono trigger crimson echoes: the reproduction cart of this game nerver came out though
GameSack You guys ought to track down a game called The Legend of Zelda: Parallel Worlds. Its a game hack made from A Link to the Past. It has a good story and worth checking out. To me, it seems the save function doesnt work, so youre better off using the emulators saveload state functions to save your game and progress through the game.
GameSack They should play more PlayStation titles...
GameSack play more of this! pls!!
GameSack Anthony you are so stupid
GameSack Soon Im getting the PS4 with Battlefield 4 and Knack! So excited!!!
GameSack This is stupid I hate you too
GameSack Do you think you could play Dead Island?
GameSack Vendor food bag. Merry christmas Tarkleigh!
GameSack Thats pretty cool, i like it.
GameSack To be honest, Gameday 98 revolutionized football games.
GameSack I now sports gams are had to pay
GameSack please do another sports game dudez and get some Tony Hawk in there...
GameSack I kept watching and waiting for Tecmo Bowl to pop out. Many... MANY hours playing that game with pals o mine. And guess what? The Broncos was my team! Good defensive players. Not that I took offense that Dave stole my team! (Damn you!)The only sports games I ever got into was Tecmo Bowl and some Golf games. But hey, no deal breakers though. NBA Jam sessions with old buds a few times. I enjoy watching you guyzes videos. Ive noticed a few nice games I never heard of before and tried them. Keep all the videos game footage rollin out. Cheers!
GameSack Ok guys I know you dont want to hear it but play MVP Baseball 05 for ps2. Its great. Dont put it in an episode just play for your own good. Play the hitting minigame guarantee youll have a ultra good time and you dont have to be a sports game fan to enjoy it
GameSack Im surprised but not appalled that you never mentioned the Backyard Sports series from Humongous Entertainment. Or NBA Jam for that matter. Other than that no complaints here.
GameSack I was always a fan of Mario Strikers but thats probably because I always win
GameSack Surprised to see no mention of NFL Blitz in here. That to me was the best arcade style sports game on the N64.
GameSack You guys skipped NBA Jam..
GameSack I never play sports games, but I still watched this episode...because of how much I love Game Sack.
GameSack If you play this game on that MSI you unboxed, Ill shit my pants
GameSack WTF. its not skill now. Its lucksac with the player who ends up with getting good cards for their deck and random topdeck duel.
GameSack I dont totally understand people who keep on saying that only lucky people will now win. From my understanding, up until the top 16, it would be regular play, thus eliminating the bad players. Then in the top 16, its Draft. Its not like sealed play, were you hope to pull the best cards to win. You get your own packs and you get to pick the best one out of them and continue to pass the cards until the deck is basically complete. Its not totally luck guys. Of course, some might still end up with a greater amount of good cards, but it still definitely skill to win.
GameSack they should give everyone the same structure deck for the double digit rounds
GameSack What packs do u get to get
GameSack I agree they need to do something. I beleive the last straw was when EVERYONE started showing up with dragons. Talk about boring. Dont agreee.....then you people that go to these events give Konami suggestions. But jesus talk about luck of the draw using unopened packs.
GameSack They state, the Americas because America expands from Canada all the way down to Argentina.
GameSack The americas is a term for north south and central america
GameSack They call it The Americas because there are more than one. Do schools in the states forget to mention there are seven continents, including North and South America?
GameSack i do not like this at all
GameSack Mortal Kombat 2 should have been in there.
GameSack I liked GOW1 best of the GOW series kratos was just the easyiest to sympathize with in GOW1better sequalsRE2  RE1megaman X  megaman(as a whole)also i loved super mario bros 2a link to the past
GameSack Agreed with a lot of people here:Mega Man 1  Mega Man 2Mortal Kombat  Mortal Kombat IITurko 1  Turkok 2Bomberman  Super Bomberman
GameSack Great video  lots of effort and care put into it. Always nice to watch
GameSack Earthbound(Mother 2) is a much better and easier game than the first. As good as Mother was, it sadly didnt make it over here to the States officially and is a very hard game unless you grind a lot.
GameSack Wow, since Im not a huge retro gamer I thought I would never see you guys talking about a game I played. Castlevania Belmonts Revenge is so much better than The Adventure. I think what ruined that game for me was the infinitely respawning enemies, specially in the final level, as well as that stupid whip downgrade with every single hit you took.
GameSack Silent hill 2 and Simons Quest
GameSack Kratose, man I hate that whiny shit stain!Well, I dont know about other people but I dont like QTE because it annihilates your immersion in the game. When Im playing a game, the square button doesnt exist. When I want to jump I dont think oh, I have to press the square button now I think jump!. Then this prompt comes up and Im like shit, wheres squair again?! Oh, right.... its Jump! But then Ive missed the prompt, and you dead, or you keep fighting. Oh, and if its differant each time, its even worse. Then there is the fact that it is playing the same cut scene, over and over again, that you cant even watch. Because you have to constraint on watching for the button presses. It has NOTHING to do with it only a few button presses.Personally, I liked Pilot Wings 1 a lot better than PW64. That might be because of Nostalgia though.
GameSack GOD OF WAR!!!!!! YYEEEESSSSS!!!!
GameSack Fun video! But... do you really use the stick like that?
GameSack Im getting a Neo Geo for Christmas and I cant wait to play games on it. Even though I have it on my possession Im not allowed to play on it.
GameSack Do you have your Duo modified to output RGB?
GameSack hi guy i need help i am buying a neo geo AES from japan i was told i will need to get a AC power supply to play it here in the U.S i dont know much about the neo geo AES could really use some help plz.
GameSack Lol, uknow u a gamer when u got extra long thumbs lol gaming thumbs to stick.in ur asshole when u got a deep clogging lmao
GameSack love the channel you guys! Hey Joe, is the song on this episode a remix of a Legendary Axe II stage theme? The main theme of this song keeps reminding me of the song in stage 2, or 3, maybe even the 1st stage. Any help would be appreciated. Keep up the good work on the high quality episodes you have been cranking out, and I look forward to more!
GameSack This vid made me laugh
GameSack only time we ever saw these back in the day was in the import ad section of mean machines (an english megadrive magazine) and we all couldnt believe the prices but were blown away with the screenshots and could only wonder what it would be like to own such a powerful arcade console at home.In hindsight,all of the games are just coin munchers with swish graphics or fighters and its probably the shallowest console in history haha..I think it works better as an arcade machine personally as you get the thrill of feeding it coins and would love an mvs cab with a multicart at home
GameSack I see all rocket knight adventure fans feel the same way.
GameSack I thought Halo 2 was pretty bad when I played it. The story was crap, game play was crap, and the ending was crap. It just didnt have the charm the first did, and they removed the assault rifle.
GameSack Jeremy Parish wrote a fantastic analysis of Zelda II here: http:www.2dimensions.com20130307theanatomyofzeldaiiigenreshiftIts definitely my least favourite entry in the series but reading this made me appreciate it a little more.
GameSack I have been trying to find El Viento for my collection. Havent had good luck though :(
GameSack dragons lair 2 was much worse than the first one, the fun thing in the first one was that the stages came in a random order and sometimes inverted, DL2 was just a quicktime event movie.
GameSack Right on the money on all spots, even though I have a soft spot for Zelda II and dont care much for the first game because I knew II first, I understand the appeal and I love the SNES sequel. Great job.
GameSack LET ME BLAST IN PEEEEEACE!!!!Christ, I lost it. Love you guys.
GameSack You guys should do an all Zelda episode. It would be epic!
GameSack Wolf Team is not perfectTell that to Star Ocean...
GameSack AHAB... All hackers are bastards
GameSack ACAB All Campers Are Bastards
GameSack BUFU  BY US FUCK YOU !!
GameSack Camper Hacker Noob BIATSCH
GameSack RTKS Road To K.E.M Strike
GameSack PAS  Plaque am Sack .
GameSack CHFC Commanders Hackficker Crew
GameSack Under 5 dollars, PLUS SHIPPING!!!Dont you mean INCLUDING SHIPPING!!!?
GameSack I really want someone to remake Deep Fear...
GameSack What? No Streets of Rage Remake? Yo soy disappoint.Also, TMNT: Reshelled sucked anyway. You didnt miss anything.
GameSack Resident Evil Remake for the Gamecube is the remake of all remakes. If you havent then you should play it.
GameSack Literally, this is the first time Ive heard ANYBODY recommend the Flashback Remake. .
GameSack In regards remakes Escape from Monkey Island is recommended for any PC Gamers who love the SCUMM based games, just fingers crossed they will remake Manic Mansion 2: Day of the Tentacle (Although digital only and I would love a physical Big Box copy) or Full Throttle :(
GameSack Dragon Force remake would be awesome
GameSack What about Prince of Persia for snes? not sure if a remake but it has a lot more levels and improved gameplay, i loved it. It was made by the guys from Target Earth and Cybernator too
GameSack I was expecting to see Bionic Commando rearmed, but good show, non the less, gentlemen.
GameSack where did they include the original Metroid on Zero Mission?
GameSack bei denen kommt alles spter :)
GameSack You should definitely check out Enemy Zero... its not quite as bad as D, and it has some interesting FPSlike segments that are pretty good for a Saturn game.
GameSack You didnt wash your hands after touching outside stuff OO, I imagine the next episode will correct this and have a new hand washing scene as per the previous Halloween 1 episode
GameSack Fuckin A Madballs!That toy line had a surprisingly good quality cartoon, too.
GameSack i would have added the onimusha or resident evil series
GameSack Joe, I for one would really appreciate it if Enemy Zero was featured in an episode. I beat that game once in normal mode back in 99. It was a hybrid FMVFPS, but in some ways it was an antiFPS in that you couldnt blast willy nilly, you had 13 shots that you had to charge against an invisible enemy. I have played games less frustrating, but never a game that confounded expectations as much Also Why no D2? Maybe a Kenji Eno episode?
GameSack I thought Id mention to you... when I was in third grade, I went as Beetlejuice for Halloweener, the cartoon version (with the red shirt inside), rather than the movie one (white shirt inside).
GameSack You know why the original Splatterhouse was great and the remake for PS3XBOX360 sucked?Its because the original was from Namco,but the remake was from Namcos biggest mistake.Namco Bandai.
GameSack can someone please explain to me why splatterhouse 1 was never released on the mega drive but 2 and 3 where and why was 2 and 3 only released on the mega drive and not the arcades? its all a bit bizarre and silly if you ask me
GameSack Any time that diarrhea is brought up in an episode, you know it has been a good one!
GameSack I always knew sonic was more badass than mario! Too bad he choose the chucky route ..
GameSack Thanks! We do have a Facebook and Twitter. If you check out the Game Sack Episode guide linked to on every description it lists all that at the top of the page. I dont really think that reminding people to subscribe at the end of the video would help at all. I would rather our viewers be smart enough to figure out that one on their own. :) But yeah we suck at PR. We dont whore ourselves out there and mostly rely on word of mouth (aka you guys) and weve been pretty happy with that so far.
GameSack The classic above all classics XD Thanks for making this its own video :)
GameSack You guys really like stopmotion huh? Well done
GameSack I hope you do not have to make too much takes because of theses
GameSack Joe have you played any of the pikmin games? Im playing pikmin 3 right now...totally underrated series in the US i think,
GameSack Dave didnt wipe his butt after pooping. Gross, thats how you get hemorrhoids.
GameSack Everything you guys post is worth watching, Waiting extra week between shows hurts, but worth it.
GameSack Whats going to be scary is the laundry, No wipe.
GameSack The reviewer never liked Doom or Mortal Kombat? ...you review 90s video games..you dont have be a fanboy..but to have no interest in 2 of the largest franchises in 90s gaming seems odd..it feels like my dad from when i was a teen doing a video game review show...
GameSack I just want to say thank you and that I appreciate this review. When I saw the title, I didnt actually expect you guys to literally cover all the games for this system.
GameSack Master system  System 16 Genesis  System 3232x  Model 1Saturn  Model 2 and Model 3Dreamcast  Naomi
GameSack A decent port of Daytona USA on the 32x wouldve had me sold.
GameSack Long live Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf.
GameSack Call me crazy but .. I liked the Sega 32X
GameSack I want Daves shirt. Star Trek: Starfleet Academy is fn awesome.
GameSack I heart game sack. You guys are more in depth than most reviewers. And I think the show has gotten a lot better through the years.
GameSack This is one of my favorite channels on YouTube.
GameSack If they had released Knuckles Chaotix on the Genesis or Saturn it wouldnt have been forgotten like it was.
GameSack the mark of kri was an awesome game
GameSack Nights. Hes only ever had 2 games, both of those stories being extremely lackluster, but the game series really does have good potential.
GameSack People always seem to mention when a games sound is so Genesis or So Turbo and never Nintendo but man for me Stunt Race FX has a veeeeery distinct SNES sound. Its definitivestandard. Which isnt bad, by any means.
GameSack The 7th Saga by Enix on SNES is the best RPG Ive played that never caught on. You select one of seven characters  the whole game youre competing with your six rivals to get Runes. Mode7 battles as well.
GameSack How different would the game be if Ristar was ten million degrees at the surface?
GameSack I miss maximo I think thats how its spelled lol
GameSack Woo, Mark of Kri was one of my favorite ps2 games.
GameSack I love the targeting controls in Mark of Kri.
GameSack Solar Striker is a total ripoff of Zanac!
GameSack !!!PLEASE READ!!! Did you say You play the green Zelda? And how is he like Mario?
GameSack Ahaha...yall a fool fa this
GameSack thanks man go dolphins and to the other dolphin fans on youtube
GameSack haha got u subbed bro. what a win! good vid
GameSack If a meteorite was coming towards me and i had only had one thing to do before i died? hmmm yes definitely make love to a beautiful woman p Yep no regrets! D hahahahah Good video man!
GameSack Andys right on the money.Cardiff are so lucky to have Solskjaer. Theyll probably end up finishing higher than United....
GameSack 100 Right...Moyes should be informed in no uncertain terms to fuckoff and never be allowed anywhere near Old Trafford or Carrington again. Im totally sick of the site of him. He should be ashamed..5m a year..Incompetent and substandard.
GameSack Look just dont blame Moyes for this okay a swansea player injured rio, Moyes have no choice what to do so he brought fabio on, he did not know the red was going to happen and another thing Buttner is a Man Utd future no point of selling him he is the next Patrice Evra. Oh yeah the only thing that can save Man Utd is to find the next Cantona.
GameSack STAND BY YOUR NEW MANAGER. Fergie
GameSack Dont blame the training regime for van persies injury, Moyes is a professional football coach with a lot of experience.
GameSack U need to give him a chance guys remember fergie never won anything in his first two years at united
GameSack Whats this guys twitter? Seriously, he knows his stuff. And he brings humour to it. Someone help me
GameSack i reeaaally hope moyes gets sackes next season so giggs can be our next manager
GameSack Im so sick of hearing Moyes Out. Just stick by the manager, look at SAF if we havent stuck by him we wouldnt be the club we are today. Just stick by Moyes and stop booing the bloody players.
GameSack What a phenomenal tackle. This kid is an incredible athlete.
GameSack The SEC is overrated honestly. They refuse to play decent nonconference games, and theyre all at home. Then they get to bowl games and struggle with teams theyre supposed to beat handily. Like UGA against Nebraska last year, UGA would have beaten Bama if they knew how to manage the clock, and then they were behind Nebraska and only jumped ahead because of mental errors from Nebraskas offense...
GameSack He just ignores his own lineman trying to help him. Mad respect for that
GameSack Hate to see that for Mettenberger...hope hes ok...I work in the city where he was born and raised...good kid...should have a nice NFL career.
GameSack Gotta love how Gary thought Zack walking off was inspiring.I think it shows that Zack was going to go to great lengths to get the fuck off that field as fast as he could.
GameSack And thats him in the NFL. Ford is a good player. In the NFL they have the best of the best. We saw Ford do that to him...I cant imagine what manziel will do in the NFL....probably nothing.
GameSack They ARE back!! WAR EAGLE!!
GameSack Yeah hes not gonna get anywhere near Winston on Monday night.
GameSack actually he was fired in the asu parking lot
GameSack my 1st video on youtube 23092013
